__label__1 I can't be the only one eagerly anticipating Cheyanne's podcast! She teased it a while back, and I’m so curious to hear her thoughts on everything that went down in the villa. I feel like she has so much to share, especially about her experiences and the friendships she formed.     What do you all think she’ll talk about? Any predictions on guests she might have? I hope she spills some tea on the behind-the-scenes moments we didn’t get to see! Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I've been trying to get my hands on the English version of Part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Steel Ball Run, but I'm having no luck! I know it's been officially released, but every time I check online retailers or local comic shops, it's either out of stock or way overpriced.     Has anyone else had this issue? Are there any reliable places you guys recommend for purchasing it? I really want to dive into this part since I've heard so many great things about it, especially the character development and the unique setting. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 If you have a song, a video, a podcast, a bible verse, a word of advice, your own personal story, anything that might be helpful, I would be very appreciative of your contribution. I am a female in my 20s and I have drifted from my faith and don’t know very many Catholics. I feel depressed and unworthy of even asking god for help. I know I need to go to confession but I am so anxious to go as I haven’t been in years and have never confessed any of my sexual sins. I feel really alone and lost. Anything helps. Thanks
__label__0 When [googling "ethernet splitter"](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethernet+splitter&amp;tbm=isch) intuition immediately tells that you can have one input (where the cable coming from the router enters) which can be split to 2 computers at the other end.    However, this is not how it works:    &gt;To use splitters, you’ll need two: one to connect your two devices, and another at the other end to “unsplit” the connection. This means you’ll still be using the same number of Ethernet ports on your router as if you were using two separate cables. You don’t add any Ethernet ports by using a splitter, you simply share a single cable.    (source [https://www.howtogeek.com/797864/ethernet-splitter-vs.-switch-whats-the-difference/](https://www.howtogeek.com/797864/ethernet-splitter-vs.-switch-whats-the-difference/))    **QUESTION**: why isn't the signal simply **split** ? What is it that a switch does differently ?

__label__1 This is a question that has puzzled many pizza lovers over the years! The reason round pizzas are typically placed in square boxes comes down to practicality and cost-effectiveness.    First, square boxes are easier and cheaper to manufacture. They can be made from a single sheet of cardboard, which can be folded into a box shape. This process is more efficient than creating a round box, which would require more material and more complex manufacturing techniques.    Second, square boxes are easier to stack and store. They fit neatly together, which is important for delivery and storage in restaurants. A round box would take up more space and be less stable when stacked.    Additionally, a square box provides more surface area for the pizza to rest on, which can help prevent it from sliding around during transport. It also allows for easy access to the pizza slices, as you can simply lift the lid and reach in without having to maneuver around a circular shape.    So while it may seem odd at first glance, the combination of cost, efficiency, and practicality makes square boxes the preferred choice for delivering our beloved round pizzas!

__label__0 When i had backpain i decided to lay down whole day. On the next day my pain got worse xD, so i thought that i need more activity instead. I can barely walk after that, felt like im so tired it's insane. I didn't want to sleep, thought. I felt that i need to breathe more, and that i need to lay down for a bit, constantly. Felt that it's harder to even walk up on stairs to 2nd floor, thought im 24 y.o. male that was cycling on bike regurally... and stopped only 2 weeks before that incident.         It was actually a chronic pain. I couldn't sit, staying in place was also problematic cuz of pots and backpain. So i was laying down like 2-4h per day, after 9h of sleep ofc. Was walking a lot, thought. It was like that for 3 months. Then i figured out that i can sit normally using corset for my back, thought my neck still feel bad. After that my POT symptoms got better. Coinsidence?         Today POTS got worse, but im laying down a lot again... now because of extreme fatigue.
__label__1 I've been dealing with long COVID for over a year now, and it's been a tough journey not just physically but also financially. I was wondering if anyone here has found any financial assistance or resources that have helped them cope with the financial burden that comes with long COVID.    I’ve had to cut back on work hours due to fatigue and brain fog, which has significantly impacted my income. I’ve looked into disability benefits, but the process seems daunting and I’m not sure if I qualify. I’ve also heard about some grants or programs specifically for those affected by COVID-19, but I’m not sure where to start looking.    If anyone has successfully navigated this or found any helpful resources, I would really appreciate your insights. It’s been overwhelming trying to manage everything, and I feel like I’m drowning in bills while trying to recover.     Thanks in advance for any advice or support you can offer. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this struggle.

__label__1 I've been struggling with my depression for a while now, and one of the things that really gets to me is how I interpret the things I read or hear. I often find myself taking positive affirmations or advice and twisting them into something negative. For example, when someone says, "You are enough," my mind immediately jumps to, "But what if I'm not?"     I want to be able to gauge which sentences or pieces of advice might actually be helpful for me, but it feels like my brain is constantly sabotaging that effort. I know there are people out there who have found certain phrases or mantras that resonate with them and help them cope, but I can't seem to find that clarity.     Does anyone have tips on how to filter through the noise and find the words that can genuinely uplift me? How do you discern what is helpful versus what your mind might twist into something harmful? I really want to work on this, but I feel stuck.
__label__1 Cam Newton continues to solidify his legacy as one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in NFL history. With his 60th rushing touchdown yesterday, he has officially moved into the top 50 all-time in rushing touchdowns. This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering he is the only quarterback in the top 100.     Newton's ability to not only pass but also run effectively has changed the way the quarterback position is viewed in the league. His combination of size, speed, and agility allows him to be a dual-threat, making him a nightmare for defenses.     As he continues to break records and set new milestones, it’s clear that Cam's impact on the game will be felt for years to come. What do you all think? Can he climb even higher in the rankings before he hangs up his cleats?

__label__1 The relationship between skin chemistry, particularly the presence of carboxylic acids, and tumor susceptibility is a fascinating area of research. Carboxylic acids are organic compounds that can influence various biological processes, including cell signaling and immune responses. In humans and animals, the composition of skin lipids and other secretions can vary significantly, which may affect how susceptible an organism is to tumors.    One hypothesis is that certain chemical codes, including the types and concentrations of carboxylic acids present in the skin, could influence the local immune environment. For instance, some carboxylic acids may have anti-inflammatory properties, while others could promote inflammation, which is a known risk factor for tumor development. Additionally, the skin microbiome, which interacts with these chemical codes, can also play a role in modulating immune responses and potentially influencing tumor susceptibility.    Regarding mosquito attraction, it is well-documented that mosquitoes are drawn to specific chemical cues emitted by human skin. These cues include lactic acid, ammonia, and various carboxylic acids. The variation in skin chemistry between humans and different animal species could lead to differences in attractiveness to mosquitoes. For example, the specific types and ratios of carboxylic acids present in the skin of a human versus a dog or a cow could result in varying levels of attraction for mosquitoes.     In summary, the chemical composition of skin, including the presence of carboxylic acids, may indeed influence both tumor susceptibility and the attraction of mosquitoes. Further research is needed to explore these relationships in depth, particularly through comparative studies across different species.

__label__1 Today, my mom (Tot's grandma) expressed some concerns about my toddler's behavior, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. She mentioned that she’s noticed Tot can be quite stubborn and sometimes throws little fits when things don’t go his way. For example, if he wants a snack and I say it’s not time yet, he’ll start to cry and throw himself on the floor.     I know that toddlers are naturally testing boundaries and expressing their emotions, but I’m worried that I might not be handling it the right way. I try to stay calm and redirect him, but sometimes it feels like nothing works.     Grandma suggested that I might need to be stricter with him, but I’m hesitant to go that route. I want to encourage his independence and help him learn to express his feelings without feeling punished.     Has anyone else dealt with similar concerns from family members? How do you balance your parenting style with the opinions of others, especially when it comes to discipline? Any tips on managing stubborn behavior in toddlers would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been on HRT for about three months now, taking 4mg of estradiol daily along with spironolactone. My doctor has suggested increasing my estradiol dose to 6mg, and I'm curious about what to expect from this change.     I've read that some people experience a plateau in their progress after a certain point, and I'm wondering if increasing the dose will help me avoid that or if I might still hit a plateau regardless.     For those who have increased their estradiol dosage, did you notice any significant changes in your body or emotional state? How long did it take for you to feel the effects of the increased dose?     Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__1 I recently got banned from a subreddit for sharing my opinion, and I’m feeling a mix of frustration and confusion about it. The subreddit was focused on discussions around women’s rights and feminism, which I thought was a space for open dialogue. I shared my perspective on a particular issue, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and understanding different viewpoints.     However, my comment was met with a lot of backlash, and I was ultimately banned for what the moderators deemed as "disruptive behavior." I genuinely thought I was contributing to the conversation, but it seems like my opinion didn’t align with the majority, and I was quickly shut down.     This experience has left me wondering about the balance between maintaining a safe space for marginalized voices and allowing for diverse opinions. I understand that some topics can be sensitive, but I also believe that healthy discussions can lead to growth and understanding.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you navigate spaces where your opinion might not be well-received? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
__label__0 Any idea what started the fire?
__label__1 I recently started a new job, and while I’m excited about the opportunity, I’m finding it challenging to navigate the workplace dynamics. My team is quite diverse, and I feel like I’m struggling to connect with my colleagues. I often find myself feeling left out during conversations and team activities, which makes me anxious about going to work each day.    I want to build better relationships with my coworkers, but I’m not sure how to approach them without coming off as awkward or intrusive. I’ve tried joining in on discussions, but I often feel like I don’t have much to contribute, especially since I’m still learning the ropes of my role.    Additionally, I’ve noticed that some team members seem to have established cliques, which makes it even harder for me to feel included. I don’t want to force friendships, but I also don’t want to feel isolated at work.     Does anyone have advice on how to break the ice and foster connections with coworkers? Are there specific strategies or conversation starters that have worked for you in similar situations? Any tips on how to feel more comfortable in a new work environment would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Lets say, I created 100 new Armored Artillery equipments. If I were to add a battalion of them to my tank divison, I would need 300 total to roll them out to the units in the field. Now, all of my tank divisions will not be at full strength, since I don't have enough equipment. Does this matter? Is there a combat penalty for being behind in equipment, or would they just not have all the stats from the missing tanks?
__label__1 I've been replaying Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and there's one thing that I just can't wrap my head around. **Spoilers ahead!**     So, we all know that the game has a lot of twists and turns, but the whole concept of Venom Snake being a body double for Big Boss really throws me off. I mean, throughout the game, you’re led to believe that you are indeed Big Boss, but then it’s revealed that you’re actually a phantom, a mere stand-in for the real deal.     What I find particularly fascinating (and confusing) is how this impacts the narrative and the themes of identity and legacy. Venom Snake is essentially a product of Big Boss's will, yet he has his own journey and struggles. It raises questions about what it means to be a hero or a villain when your identity is built on someone else's.     Also, how does this tie into the larger Metal Gear lore? Does this mean that Big Boss's legacy is more about the actions of his 'phantom' than his own? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this and how you interpret Venom Snake’s role in the story.     Thanks!
__label__1 I took a break from Genshin Impact for a few months, and now I'm thinking about diving back in. I remember the basics, but I feel a bit overwhelmed with all the new characters, events, and updates that have come out since I last played.     For those of you who have taken breaks and returned, how difficult was it for you to get back into the swing of things? Did you find it easy to catch up on the story and events? Are there any tips you would recommend for someone trying to reorient themselves in the game?     Also, are there any must-have characters or weapons that I should focus on now that I’m back? I’d love to hear your experiences and advice!
__label__1 Hello everyone! I wanted to start a discussion about whether it's appropriate to offer subscriptions or membership services here on /r/GiftofGames.     I've seen various gaming communities where members offer subscriptions for exclusive content, game giveaways, or even just to support the community. However, I’m unsure if this is something that aligns with the spirit of this subreddit, which is primarily focused on gifting games to those in need.    Here are a few points I’d like to discuss:    1. **Community Guidelines**: Are there any specific rules against offering subscriptions or paid memberships in this subreddit? I want to ensure that I’m not violating any guidelines.    2. **Value to Members**: Would offering subscriptions provide real value to the community? For example, could it help fund more game giveaways or support members who are struggling to afford games?    3. **Alternative Support**: If subscriptions aren’t allowed, what are some alternative ways to support the community? Perhaps through donations or organizing events?    4. **Feedback from Members**: I’d love to hear your thoughts! Do you think subscriptions would be welcomed, or would they detract from the core mission of gifting games?    Looking forward to hearing your opinions!
__label__1 I’ve been seeing a lot of buzz about the upcoming transmog feature in Cyberpunk 2077, but honestly, I’m not that excited about it. I get that it’s a way to customize our characters and make them look unique, but I feel like it might take away from the immersion of the game.     In a world where style and aesthetics are so important, I love the idea of finding gear that not only has great stats but also looks cool. I worry that with transmog, we might end up with a bunch of players running around in the same outfits just because they want the best stats, which could make Night City feel less vibrant and diverse.     Plus, I’ve always enjoyed the thrill of hunting for that perfect piece of gear that not only enhances my abilities but also fits my character’s style. I hope they find a way to balance it so that it doesn’t detract from the overall experience.     What do you all think? Are you looking forward to transmog, or do you share my concerns?
__label__0 EDIT: omg you all are incredible. So much amazing advice, I haven’t had the time to reply to everyone yet!! I am so excited to get more into this world!!!    I want to get into sewing because I would like to make more of my own clothes (I currently knit but I can’t just have a whole wardrobe full of knitted clothes).    But when I look at homemade clothes a lot of them look oddly… bulky? Boxy? Stiff? Just not very flowy. I can’t tell if it’s the type of fabric people are using or just the nature of home sewn clothing. Or maybe I’m just seeing a lot of beginner projects and getting more intricate fit/drape is a more advanced skill? What types of skills should I look to build on my sewing journey to get more flowy clothing? Does anybody know any good, flowy patterns that I could aspire to work towards?

__label__0 My (23f) boyfriend (28m) knows I’ve been horny for him all day. However, we’ve been out and about so we haven’t really been able to do anything about it. We came home with the intention of cooking and then maybe having some fun (wink wink). We made bulgogi for the first and it was delicious. So good. We couldn’t stop eating it and talking about how delicious it was. Here’s where we ran into a small problem. We both became too full to be horny. I started complaining to him that I wanted to be horny but the full feeling was really powerful. He felt the same. We went to lie down and cuddle after the meal. Now, I’m horny again. I told him once and he said he’s too full and started talking about the lamp next to us. I told him another time and he started to ask about what could possibly have made me horny (felt like he was setting the mood). Then he stopped and said he was still too full!     Not much to complain about other than the fact that I seemed to get over the full feeling faster and now am very turned on…    Edit: I asked him about how he was feeling a little after writing this… now he said he’s thinking about desert!
__label__1 I recently started collecting raw crystals and fossils, and I’ve been wondering about the best way to seal them to protect their beauty and integrity. I’ve heard that sealing can help prevent damage from moisture and dirt, but I want to make sure I’m doing it right without harming the stones.    From what I’ve gathered, there are a few methods to seal raw crystals and fossils:    1. **Clear Acrylic Spray**: This is a popular choice for sealing. It provides a protective layer without altering the appearance of the crystal. Just make sure to apply it in a well-ventilated area and do a test spray on a small area first to ensure it doesn’t change the color or texture.    2. **Natural Oils**: Some collectors use natural oils like mineral oil or jojoba oil. These can enhance the color and shine of the crystal while providing a light seal. However, be cautious as some oils can attract dust and dirt over time.    3. **Wax**: Beeswax or carnauba wax can be used to create a protective layer. Melt the wax and apply it with a soft cloth, then buff it to a shine. This method is great for fossils as it can help preserve their details.    4. **Resin**: For more delicate pieces, using a clear epoxy resin can provide a strong seal. This method is more involved and requires careful application, but it can offer excellent protection.    I’d love to hear your experiences! What methods have you used to seal your crystals or fossils? Any tips or tricks to share? Also, are there any specific types of crystals or fossils that shouldn’t be sealed? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I've been grinding through the game and my squad is starting to feel a bit stale. I'm looking for some budget-friendly options that can really elevate my team without breaking the bank.     So far, I've had my eye on a few cards that seem to be performing well in the community. For instance, I’ve heard great things about Ruby J.R. Smith. His shooting ability is insane for the price, and he can create his own shot pretty well.     Another card I’m considering is the Amethyst DeAndre Jordan. His rebounding and defense are top-notch, and he can finish strong at the rim. Plus, he’s usually pretty cheap on the market.     I’m also curious about some of the lower-tier cards that might be flying under the radar. If anyone has suggestions for hidden gems or specific players that have been performing well in their lineups, I’d love to hear them! Let’s help each other build some competitive squads without spending too much!

__label__1 I've been playing PoE for a while now, but I keep hitting a wall in Act 9. I can't seem to get past the bosses, and my character keeps dying. I’ve tried adjusting my gear and skills, but nothing seems to work.     I’m currently playing a Witch, focusing on a spellcaster build, but I feel like I’m missing something crucial. The damage output is decent, but I can’t seem to survive the hits from the bosses. I’ve been using Flameblast and some defensive spells, but it’s just not cutting it.     I’ve read that Act 9 can be a real difficulty spike, especially with the bosses like the "The Brine King" and "The Elder." I’m wondering if anyone has tips on how to approach these fights or if there are specific mechanics I should be aware of.     Should I focus on getting more life or resistances? Are there any specific skills or gems that can help me survive better? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been thinking about getting a programmable mouse for my OSRS gameplay. I’ve seen some players using them to bind certain spells or items to mouse buttons, which seems like it could really speed up my reaction time in PvP and boss fights.     Does anyone here use a programmable mouse? If so, what buttons do you have set up for OSRS? I’m particularly interested in how you’ve configured it for things like switching gear quickly or using specific abilities.     Also, are there any downsides to using a programmable mouse? I’ve heard some people say it can be considered cheating in certain games, but I’m not sure how that applies to OSRS. Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 So, I recently had to start my journey in Final Fantasy XIV all over again, and let me tell you, it’s been a wild ride! After a long break from the game, I decided to return and found that my old account was lost to the void of forgotten passwords and email changes. Instead of letting that discourage me, I took it as an opportunity to experience the game anew.    I rolled a new character, a Miqo'te this time, and I’m absolutely loving the fresh start. The nostalgia hit me hard as I went through the early quests in Gridania, and I found myself appreciating the story and world-building even more than I did the first time around. The music, the scenery, and the characters are just as enchanting as I remember.    I’ve been taking my time, soaking in every detail, and even trying out classes I didn’t explore much before. I’ve fallen in love with the Bard class, and I’m having a blast learning the ins and outs of playing music in the game. Plus, I’ve made some new friends along the way, which has been a huge bonus!     I know starting over can be daunting, especially with all the content that’s been added since I last played, but I’m finding it refreshing. It’s like seeing the game through new eyes, and I’m excited to see how far I can go this time.     For anyone else who’s had to start over, how did you handle it? Any tips for making the most of a fresh start? Let’s share our experiences!

__label__1 Yes, you can bring a houseplant into Canada from the US, but there are specific regulations you need to follow to ensure that you comply with Canadian import laws. Here are some key points to consider:    1. **Plant Health Certificate**: Depending on the type of plant, you may need a phytosanitary certificate from the USDA, which verifies that the plant is free from pests and diseases.    2. **Permitted Plants**: Not all plants are allowed. Some species may be restricted or prohibited due to the risk of pests or diseases. It's a good idea to check the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website for a list of plants that are allowed.    3. **Inspection**: Upon arrival in Canada, your plant may be subject to inspection by border services. Be prepared to declare it and provide any necessary documentation.    4. **Soil Restrictions**: If your plant is in soil, there may be additional restrictions. In some cases, it might be advisable to remove the soil and transport the plant bare-rooted.    5. **Personal Use**: Generally, if you are bringing the plant for personal use and not for resale, the process is usually simpler.    Before you travel, it’s best to double-check the latest regulations on the CFIA website or contact them directly for any specific questions regarding your plant. Happy planting!
__label__0 I collect cards but I'm fairly new to really playing and I only have one person to play with until I start going to FNM, so I don't have much to base it off of. I fairly enjoy making decks and upgrading them. I have a Dimir deck and an Azorius deck and I like to upgrade them with cool cards but I dont want to get to the point that I have too many cards lying around, so I'm wondering how many decks do you all have?  (Not sure if this is the right flair)
__label__1 Last night, I had a dream that felt so vivid and strange that I just had to share it. I found myself in a massive library, but it wasn’t just any library; it was filled with books that seemed to glow with a soft, golden light. Each book had a title that was written in a language I couldn’t understand, but somehow, I knew they contained the secrets of the universe.    As I wandered through the aisles, I felt an overwhelming sense of curiosity and excitement. I reached for one of the glowing books, and as I opened it, the pages began to turn on their own, revealing images and scenes from my past. I saw moments I had forgotten, both joyful and painful, and I felt a rush of emotions as I relived them.    Suddenly, the library started to shake, and the lights flickered. I looked around in panic as the books began to fly off the shelves, swirling around me like a tornado. I tried to grab onto one of the books, but it slipped through my fingers, and I was swept away in the chaos.    Just as I thought I would be lost forever, I found myself standing in a serene garden, surrounded by flowers that shimmered in the sunlight. In the center of the garden was a fountain, and as I approached it, I saw my reflection. But instead of my usual self, I looked older and wiser, with a peaceful smile on my face.    I woke up feeling a mix of confusion and tranquility. I can’t help but wonder what this dream means. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What do you think the library and the garden represent? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I've been managing our IT infrastructure for a mid-sized company for a few years now, and since the pandemic, I've noticed a significant shift in how our systems are performing and how management is reacting to it.     Post-COVID, we've seen a surge in remote work, which has put a strain on our network and server resources. We've had to scale up our VPN capacity and ensure that our cloud services can handle the increased load. However, despite our best efforts, there are still noticeable slowdowns during peak hours, especially when multiple teams are accessing shared resources simultaneously.    Management has been quite impatient with the situation, often pushing for immediate solutions without fully understanding the complexities involved. They want everything to run smoothly, but the reality is that we are still in a transition phase, and some of the issues stem from the rapid changes in how we operate.     I've tried to explain the need for a phased approach to upgrades and optimizations, but it seems like they want quick fixes instead of long-term solutions. This has led to some tension, as I feel like I'm being pressured to deliver results that may not be feasible in the short term.     Has anyone else experienced similar challenges? How do you manage expectations with upper management while also trying to implement sustainable solutions? Any advice on communicating the technical limitations and the need for a strategic approach would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 Today was a wild ride with BBIG, and I have to say, Colluci really got under my skin. His comments during the earnings call felt dismissive and out of touch with what we, the shareholders, are feeling. Instead of letting it get to me, I decided to take action. I bought an additional 300 shares!     I believe in the potential of this company and the community we’ve built around it. Every time someone tries to shake our confidence, it just makes me want to double down even more.     Let’s keep pushing forward, BBIG fam! Who else is adding to their positions? Let’s hear your stories!

__label__1 I've been playing as Hulk for a while now, and while I absolutely love smashing through enemies and feeling like a powerhouse, I've noticed a significant issue that I think needs addressing: his stagger resistance.     In the heat of battle, it feels like Hulk gets staggered way too easily, especially when facing off against tougher enemies or bosses. I mean, come on, he’s the Hulk! He should be able to take a few hits without being knocked around like a ragdoll.     I understand that stagger mechanics are in place to balance the game, but it feels like Hulk's resilience doesn't quite match his character's lore. It can be frustrating when you're in the middle of a combo or trying to unleash a devastating attack, only to be interrupted because some random enemy hit you with a projectile.     I think a slight buff to his stagger resistance would not only make him feel more true to the character but also enhance the overall gameplay experience. It would allow players to really embrace the "HULK SMASH" mentality without constantly worrying about being interrupted.     What do you all think? Has anyone else felt this way while playing as Hulk? Would love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions on how we can get this feedback to the devs!

__label__0 Suddenly, out of nowhere, all of these office buildings and leased properties are costing all of these companies tons of money without any benefit to the companies.     Leases on buildings are generally ten year leases, meaning that these companies are legally locked in via contract to pay money over ten years.     Now I'm not shilling, to be clear. This is the corporation's fault.  Historically, there are pandemics with lockdowns and such once or twice every hundred years.  Not to mention, social unrest, warfare, and any number of other things that could cause nationwide disturbances in business property.  If someone had actually sat down and like, thought about ten year leases, they would have thought of some way to lessen the financial burden on landlords and companies if something were to happen. Some insurance thing probably. I'm vaugely guessing that there's a ten percent chance of a distubance in any ten year period, which should have been *well* within risk estimation territory.     It's just wild to me that nobody is talking about this major factor, and it's why all of these companies are saying very similar things at the same time. There probably *also* are factors like boomers thinking people are lazy, and middle managers being mad that their jobs are less useful and they have less control, but the main corporate reason is property cost. Especially cause corporations are more likely to fire middle managers than listen to them.     Also, it should be noted, that all of these corps are stuck in a massive prisoner's dilemma. If you own property and you sell it early, you get most of your money back.  If everyone sells business property, it's all worthless. Since most large companies have various properties and leases they pay for and also lease out, and it's all locked up in a massive clusterfuck of paper and deals, there's a TON of property holding a TON of value for these companies which they're on track for losing the value of.     So I think right now, workers who are working from home have a huge negotiating advantage that corps are on their back foot about.  At the very least, it needs to be the main point in the work from home discussion, instead of cherrypicked bullshit about "accountability" and "professionalism" or whatever else they're pretending is the real issue.
__label__0 I have prospective roommates with a dog. I have been living in this rental for about two years, the rental agreement says “no pets without consent”. The new people have a small dog, we emailed the landlord to start the process on new roommates. He said they do not accept dogs, but the only information I’ve ever been given is “no pets without prior written consent”.     We have had two cats living here in the past.   TLDR ; Is the landlord able to just put a ban on dogs without any written specification?? I am in a tight situation and need to handle this quickly.
__label__0 Hello, my husband and I just found out our insurance through work covers nothing for IVF. We are now looking to purchase a individual policy that covers all/ as much as possible for the IVF/ fertility treatment. Open enrollment begins Nov 1 and we are hoping to find something soon.    Does anyone have experience or recommendations for insurances/ policies that cover IVF/ fertility and how much it cost? I am located in Texas .    Thank you!!
__label__1 I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year now, and I've noticed that I get a fair amount of attention from other girls, especially on social media. Some of them comment on my posts, calling me cute or being overly friendly. I usually just respond with a simple thank you or a smiley face, but I’ve been wondering if that’s crossing a line.    My girlfriend has never explicitly told me how she feels about this, but I can tell she gets a bit uncomfortable when I mention it. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel insecure, but I also don’t want to come off as rude or dismissive to the girls who are just being friendly.     Is it okay to engage with these compliments as long as I’m not reciprocating in a flirty way? Or should I just ignore them altogether to avoid any potential issues? I really value my relationship and want to make sure I’m being respectful to my girlfriend’s feelings. Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 If you just finished watching Kamen Rider Faiz and are looking for what to watch next in the Heisei era, I have a few recommendations that you might enjoy:    1. **Kamen Rider Blade** - This series has a unique card-based system and a darker tone that follows the battle between the Undead and the Riders. The character development is strong, and it has some great twists.    2. **Kamen Rider Hibiki** - A bit different from the typical Rider formula, Hibiki focuses on music and the concept of fighting demons. It has a more artistic approach and is visually stunning, with a strong emphasis on character relationships.    3. **Kamen Rider Den-O** - This series is a fan favorite for its humor and time travel elements. Den-O features a unique cast of characters, including the various Imagin who inhabit the main character. It’s a fun ride with a lot of heart.    4. **Kamen Rider Kiva** - Kiva blends elements of horror and romance, with a dual storyline set in both the present and the past. The design of the Kamen Rider and the music are standout features.    5. **Kamen Rider Decade** - If you’re interested in a crossover experience, Decade is a great choice. It features the protagonist traveling through different worlds of previous Kamen Riders, which is a nostalgic trip for fans.    6. **Kamen Rider W** - This series is known for its unique two-in-one Rider concept. The dynamic between the two main characters is fantastic, and the mystery elements keep you engaged throughout.    Each of these series has its own unique flavor and style, so I recommend checking out a few episodes to see which one resonates with you the most. Happy watching!
__label__0 I like the OWL, but damn, nothing beats the hype I had at the World Championships. It was so unique and cool to cheer for your own country, even if it was pretty weak against big opponents like Korea, USA, Canada and so on. I always liked cheering for the underdogs and it was a great way to showcase talent from all over the world. The last World Championship was pretty lame but for the first 2 years the championships were the reason I started eSports in the first place. I just hope OW2 becomes popular enough to justify a world championship.
__label__1 I have a few questions about connecting flights in Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and I hope someone here can help me out.     I have a layover in Philadelphia for about 2 hours before my next flight, and I’m a bit anxious about the whole process.     1. **Terminal Transfers**: I’ve heard that American Airlines operates out of multiple terminals at PHL. How do I know if I need to transfer terminals for my connecting flight? Is it easy to navigate between terminals?     2. **Security Check**: Will I have to go through security again if I’m connecting to another American Airlines flight? I’ve read mixed things about this, and I want to be prepared.     3. **Time Management**: Is 2 hours enough time to make my connection, considering potential delays? I’ve heard that PHL can be busy, especially during peak travel times.     4. **Baggage**: If I checked my bags in at my departure airport, will they automatically transfer to my connecting flight, or do I need to pick them up and re-check them?     5. **Food Options**: Lastly, if I have some time to spare, what are some good food options in the airport? I’d love to grab a bite while I wait.     Thanks in advance for any advice or tips you can share! I really appreciate it.
__label__0 Hi r/espresso,    After starting my espresso journey with a Rancilio Silvia machine and an Eureka Mignon Silenzio grinder, which served me well for some years, I would like to upgrade. The two main points I dislike about the Silvia are the slow time to heat up ~30 min (by which time the auto Standby switches off the machine again..) and the temperature inconsistancy.    I am making mostly espresso for myself (gf doesn’t drink) and sometimes Cappuccino but its cumbersome on a single boiler. With more accessible steaming I might be motivated to make more foam for chai/cocoa drinks fir her as well.     Apart from a faster heat up I would also like lower electricity consumption and better temperature consistency with more control i.e. PID. I would also love a manometer, seeing brew pressure just seems so nice.     While looking for something reasonable to change to, my journey went from the Lelit MaraX (nice shiny E61 group but also very slow heatup) to the Profitec Pro 300 (no manometer and not as capable PID) to the Lelit Elizabeth, which is my favorite at the time. While I don’t love the design I don’t mind it either (seems very similar to my Silvia) I like its small size, the heat up time, the steam tank which can be switched off and the preinfusion.     Am I missing an obvious machine in that prize range (I can get the Elizabeth for &lt;1.000€ but up to around 1.500€ is fine) with fast heat up and not that bad of an electricity consumption?    Is there a E61 machine with fast heating?     Anything else I am missing?
__label__1 I’m trying to remember a creepy PC game I played around 2015-2019, and I think it might have been from a developer named Kanoguti or something similar. The game had a very unsettling atmosphere, with a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving. I remember wandering through dark, eerie environments, and there were definitely elements of horror, like jump scares or disturbing imagery.    The graphics were somewhat stylized, maybe a bit retro, and the sound design really added to the creepy vibe. I think there were moments where you had to solve puzzles to progress, and the story was quite mysterious, possibly involving themes of isolation or madness.     If anyone has any idea what this game could be, I’d really appreciate your help! It’s been stuck in my mind for a while now.
__label__0   10 months later I still feel like I can't date anyone and it's breaking my heart because I keep thinking how long this will last. I find everyone incredible boring. Humor, style, personality... Everyone is boring. My ex is already dating someone else and I can't even imagine myself kissing/sleeping with other people. I'm doing the best I can spending time doing my hobbies but sometimes I get really lonely and I wish I could have someone to spend some time and have fun. I need some advice, hope idk... Am I still grieving? Is it normal to grieve for this long?
__label__1 I recently had a little mishap where my baby managed to spill formula milk all over our painted wall. I want to clean it up without damaging the paint. I've tried just wiping it with a damp cloth, but it didn't do much.     Does anyone have tips or methods for effectively removing baby formula stains from painted walls? I’m worried about using harsh chemicals that might strip the paint or leave a mark.     Any advice on gentle cleaning solutions or techniques would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been working on my game in Unreal Engine and I've hit a bit of a snag with creating a realistic ocean ambiance at the edge of my map. Currently, I'm using a simple plane with a water material and some particle effects for waves, but it feels a bit flat and not very immersive.    I want to create a more dynamic and engaging ocean experience, especially for players who might venture to the edge of the map. I've seen some games that have a seamless transition into the ocean with better sound effects and visual cues, and I want to achieve something similar.    Does anyone have suggestions for techniques or assets that could help enhance the ocean ambiance? I'm particularly interested in:  - Better water shaders or materials that can simulate depth and movement.  - Sound design tips for creating a more immersive ocean soundscape.  - Any specific blueprints or systems that can help with the transition from land to water.    Thanks in advance for your help! I'm excited to hear your ideas!

__label__1 I've been diving deeper into hip-hop lately, not just as a listener but as someone who wants to create. I'm curious about how many of you are in the same boat. Do you write lyrics, produce beats, or maybe even rap?     For me, it started as a passion for the genre, but I found myself wanting to express my own thoughts and experiences through music. I’ve been writing some verses and experimenting with beat-making software. It’s a whole different world when you start creating your own tracks!     I’d love to hear about your experiences. What do you create? How did you get started? Any tips for someone just beginning? Let’s share our journeys and maybe even collaborate!

__label__1 I’ve been thinking about getting a tattoo that represents my journey with Moonbeam and the incredible community we have here. I want to incorporate elements that symbolize both the technology and the spirit of collaboration.     My idea is to have a stylized moon with circuit patterns integrated into it, representing the Moonbeam network. Surrounding the moon, I’d like to include small stars that symbolize the various projects and developers that shine brightly in our ecosystem.     I’m also considering adding the phrase "Building Together" in a modern font, as a nod to the collaborative nature of our community.     What do you all think? Any suggestions or ideas to enhance this concept? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I want to start by saying that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to remember that God loves you and is always there for you, even in your darkest moments. The feelings of emptiness and internal coldness you describe can be very distressing, and it's understandable to seek answers and reassurance.    In Christianity, the concept of selling one's soul is often viewed metaphorically rather than literally. It can represent a turning away from God or engaging in practices that are contrary to His teachings. However, it's crucial to know that God’s grace is always available to us, no matter what we have done.     If you feel that your experience with the witch doctor and divination has left you feeling spiritually unsettled, I encourage you to seek God through prayer and scripture. Spend time in the Word, and consider reaching out to a pastor or a trusted Christian friend who can provide guidance and support. They can help you pray through your feelings and possibly lead you in a process of spiritual healing.    Additionally, participating in a community of believers can be incredibly uplifting. Surrounding yourself with people who share your faith can help you feel more connected and supported.     Remember, God is always ready to welcome you back with open arms. No matter how far you feel you’ve strayed, His love and forgiveness are greater than any mistake you might think you’ve made. Take comfort in that truth, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help as you navigate these feelings.
__label__1 Hey Guardians,    So my birthday is coming up soon, and I've been thinking about how much I want to dive deeper into the Stasis subclass. I’ve been having a blast with my other subclasses, but I feel like Stasis could really add a new layer to my gameplay, especially in PvP.    I was jokingly asking my mom if I could get Stasis as a birthday gift, but it got me thinking—what are your thoughts on Stasis? Is it worth it? How does it compare to the other subclasses in terms of versatility and fun?     Also, if you have any tips for mastering Stasis, I’d love to hear them! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’ve been feeling chronically unhappy for a while now, and it’s really starting to weigh on me. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of negativity and I can’t seem to break free. I try to focus on the good things in my life, but they often feel overshadowed by this persistent cloud of sadness.     I find it hard to connect with people, even those I care about. I feel like I’m a burden when I try to share how I’m feeling, so I often just keep it to myself. I know I should reach out for help, but the thought of opening up is terrifying.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you cope with chronic unhappiness? I’m looking for any advice or just a space to share and feel less alone in this struggle.
__label__0 I’m pretty sure this is on the driver, but want to make sure I’m not missing something.     I placed a relatively small McDonald’s order ($20), with delivery from a McDonald’s that’s just five minutes from my house because I was in a rush to get my kids dinner before we had to head out. I tipped $8 (plus whatever DD pays). Delivery estimate in the app was 17-20 minutes (pretty normal when ordering from there).    But for some reason, a driver who was about 25 min away from the restaurant (and 30 min from my house) accepted the order. After 10 minutes of placing the order, the driver texted me to let me know the food would be a bit late because they just started making their way to McDonald’s.     I texted back trying to be nice and saying “no worries, I didn’t realize a driver would have to come from so far away,” even though I wouldn’t have ordered if I had known it would take that long. The driver just responded “yeah the tip barely covers the gas.”    I felt like this was sort of a shit response given that I thought I tipped pretty well for a restaurant three miles from my house. I have no idea why a driver so far even accepted the order.     I don’t want to leave a bad review for the driver because I assume that affects him in some way, but I also feel like it’s crappy to accept an order from so far away and then complain that the tip doesn’t cover his gas.     Thoughts on how to handle? Let it go? Leave a bad review? Something else?
__label__0 I just received the Dual Destinies art book as a BDay gift from my brother in the mail and it is a beauty!  It's almost 300 pages long and the pages are thick, glossy, and durable. There is so much content like lots of unseen character sketches and storyboards. The sprites are in there as well for those who are looking for them. I didn't even know the AA games had art books but I recommend you pick one up if you are a fan of the franchise.    https://preview.redd.it/fnp98lwlnso51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74efc0b37e7a8a613fd34c5cb722e466203ee19    https://preview.redd.it/ozueltwlnso51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c08cf524e84fab7f60a56aceb0be657f49bacb5    https://preview.redd.it/n540u7ylnso51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ae7da8a4af99d85ce78bdccefc27cf0ae4c15e4

__label__1 I’m in a PPR league and I’m considering a trade that involves my team’s future. I would be giving up DeAndre Hopkins and David Montgomery in exchange for Tyreek Hill and Kenneth Gainwell.     Here’s my reasoning:   - **DeAndre Hopkins** has been solid, but I’m worried about his consistency and the Titans' offense as a whole.   - **David Montgomery** has been decent, but with Jahmyr Gibbs emerging, I’m not sure how much work he’ll get moving forward.   - **Tyreek Hill** is a game-changer and can put up huge numbers any week, especially in a PPR format.   - **Kenneth Gainwell** has been getting more involved in the Eagles' offense, and with the way they use their running backs, he could be a solid flex option.    What do you all think? Who wins this trade? Any advice would be appreciated!

__label__1 I've been trying to fully remap my hotkeys in Age of Empires IV, especially for buildings like the Council Hall and King's Palace, but it seems like some of the hotkeys just won't take effect. I can change most of them without any issues, but these specific buildings always revert back to their default settings.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a workaround or a specific setting I might be missing? I really want to customize my controls to fit my playstyle better, and it's frustrating that these key bindings aren't sticking. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Sky News host Gary Hardgrave has sparked a conversation about the value of freedom in Australia, stating that it is often taken for granted by many citizens. In a recent segment, he emphasized the importance of recognizing and appreciating the liberties that Australians enjoy, especially in light of global events that threaten democratic values. Hardgrave's remarks come as a reminder to reflect on the sacrifices made by previous generations to secure these freedoms. His comments have resonated with viewers, prompting discussions on social media about the need to actively protect and cherish the rights and freedoms that define the nation.

__label__0 I am currently on 100mg daily of Zoloft and have a prescription for Rizatriptan to take as needed. Everything I read says that I will get serotonin syndrome if I take both. But my migraines are now more frequent and make me cry they hurt so bad, so I could really use an abortive. I am currently sick with bronchitis and everytime I have a coughing fit I get an aura.     Anyone take both safely?
__label__1 I've been having some interesting conversations with my friend about dating and attraction, and I can't help but wonder if he's actually onto something or just spouting off opinions. He claims that confidence is the most attractive trait a person can have, and that it can make up for a lot of other perceived shortcomings. He also insists that the way you carry yourself and your body language can either draw someone in or push them away, regardless of how you look.    He often talks about the importance of being genuine and authentic, saying that people can sense when someone is being fake or trying too hard. He believes that if you can be yourself and show genuine interest in others, it will naturally attract people to you.     Additionally, he mentions that humor is a huge factor in attraction. He says that being able to make someone laugh not only breaks the ice but also creates a connection that can lead to something more.     So, I’m curious—do you guys think he’s right? Is confidence really the key to attraction? How much do body language and authenticity play into it? And what about humor? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

__label__0 If y'all remember the old "John" mod that added the titular mob, then you probably also remember the mega version that could spawn and it's awful screaming. I've been trying to find the origin of the mega john cry, but I haven't had any luck yet. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
__label__1 I've been searching for any official news regarding the compatibility of Pathfinder: Kingmaker with the PS5, but I haven't found much information. Given that the game was originally released for PS4, I was hoping to see some updates or announcements about whether it will be playable on the next-gen console.    Has anyone come across any statements from Owlcat Games or any other reliable sources about this? It would be great to know if we can expect any enhancements or if it will simply be backward compatible.     Also, if anyone has experience playing it on PS5 through backward compatibility, I'd love to hear how it runs! Any performance improvements or issues? Thanks!
__label__0 I’m a SD and pretty much was forced to stop using seeking cause it’s gotten so bad    My last date was on august 3rd, haven’t been on in two months    I deleted my account but made a dummy one for free to check the site here and here. And wow there’s like barely any SBs active these days lol    Feels like seeking is starting to slowly die, as it rightfully should    I personally am pessimistic but I think dating in the US is truly fucked. Meaning, it’s gotten so bad that the amount of effort and work required to get what you want is not worth it at all, at least for me    It’s a lot of wasted time to be honest: dealing with flakes, platonics, annoying girls, hookers, toe dippers, etc etc. being able to turn all of that off for good is very liberating    And it frees up so much of your time. Holy shit. I’ve made so much money in the past 2 months it’s crazy. I’ve picked up a second job, I’m more focused. I’m not wasting time dealing with girls. I’m overall maximizing my time so well it’s crazy    Whereas if I was on SA my mind would be infected daily by chicks that just want to waste my time and go on and on and on without getting to the point     I used to get butthurt while texting these girls because I just know that they’re stalling and that they’re not gonna actually meet. Or having to send a bunch of messages and like 90% of them don’t get responded to. Now I don’t have any of those problems anymore. It’s fantastic    I do think that with time seeking will slowly continue to die out    More SDs will start coming to the same conclusion that I’ve come to. That the actual gains (meaning the quality of the girl, the frequency of sex, the smoothness of the interactions) is just not worth the amount of grinding and effort required to get there.     It’s just extremely hard to find an SB that meets most of the requirements. Attractive, ready to fuck, doesn’t cause problems, not entitled, decent chemistry. Getting all that in a package is extremely hard and I don’t think people acknowledge that.     And it’s not even a good idea to stay in this long term because these solid girls are not abundant. So if there’s 1 out of 100 out there, that’s terrible. When you eventually lose the chick or have to move on, it’ll take you the same amount of grinding and work to get another one. There’s no abundance of these girls in the USA    I predict that most guys are still on SA sending their messages, dealing with bullshit and just overall wasting their time. They may meet a girl, fuck her for a few dates, then she ghosts or something happens. And they’re back to square 1 again. This wouldn’t be a problem if you could actually get a high success rate on seeking
__label__0 I recently found one of my childhood game consoles. It was my little leap frog handheld. I was excited to turn it on and see what little me put on there. I put in the batteries and upon the start up screen i feel a rush of fear and terror. I don’t know why. It was only the start up. Its been deep in my basement since. Does anyone know why i might feel this odd sense of terror?
__label__1 The term you're looking for is "standby" or "alert status." When military personnel are placed on standby, they are required to remain on or near the base and be ready to deploy at a moment's notice. This can happen during various situations, such as natural disasters, heightened security measures during elections, or other emergencies where their presence may be needed quickly. Depending on the branch of service, this may also be referred to as being in a "ready status" or being "on call."
__label__1 I recently received the COVID-19 vaccine and unfortunately experienced some severe side effects that have significantly impacted my daily life. I have been dealing with chronic fatigue, headaches, and other symptoms that have made it difficult for me to work and carry out normal activities. After consulting with my doctor, it seems that these side effects are indeed linked to the vaccine.    I am considering the possibility of pursuing legal action against the vaccine manufacturer or the healthcare provider that administered the vaccine. I understand that there are certain protections in place for vaccine manufacturers under the PREP Act, but I am unsure about my rights and options in this situation.     Can anyone provide guidance on whether it is possible to sue for vaccine-related side effects? What steps should I take to explore this option? Are there specific legal precedents or cases that I should be aware of? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I’ve been on this journey of sobriety for a while now, and I have to admit, some days I feel like a crazy person. It’s like my mind is playing tricks on me. I find myself overthinking every little thing, questioning my decisions, and feeling overwhelmed by emotions that I used to drown out with alcohol.     I know that this is part of the process, but it can be really tough. I miss the numbness that drinking provided, even though I know it was a false sense of comfort. Now, I’m left to face my feelings head-on, and sometimes it feels like too much.     I’ve been trying to find healthy outlets—like journaling, exercising, and talking to friends—but there are days when I just feel so lost. I worry that I’m not handling this well, and I wonder if I’m ever going to feel ‘normal’ again.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you cope with the emotional rollercoaster that comes with sobriety? I could really use some support and advice right now.

__label__1 I've been watching "The Vow" on HBO, and it has really opened my eyes to the complexities of the Nxivm group. While the show presents a lot of information about the cult-like practices and the manipulation of its members, I can't help but wonder if there's more to the story than what we're being shown.    Here’s my theory: what if Nxivm was not just a self-help organization gone wrong, but rather a front for something much larger? Consider the connections to high-profile individuals in politics, entertainment, and business. Could it be that Nxivm was a way to gather information on influential people, using their vulnerabilities against them?     Think about it: the group had a system of blackmail through the secretive "DOS" society, where women were coerced into providing damaging information about themselves. This could easily be used to control powerful figures.     Additionally, the timing of the group's rise and fall is curious. With the Me Too movement gaining momentum, could it be that Nxivm was targeted to distract from larger issues of abuse and power dynamics in other sectors?     I also have questions about the role of the media in all of this. Why did it take so long for the mainstream media to pick up on Nxivm? Were there attempts to suppress the story? And what about the legal system? Why did it take so long for law enforcement to act on the numerous allegations against Keith Raniere and his followers?    I’m curious to hear what others think. Is it possible that Nxivm was just the tip of the iceberg in a much larger conspiracy involving manipulation, control, and exploitation of power? What do you all think?
__label__0 Some of us are here for the tactical drip, some are working on our gunfighting skills only, some are preppers branching into learning rifle and pistol for self-defense.     Where do your priorities lie? Should we prep more or less? Should we train tactically more or less?     Obviously some of that is situation-dependent but you can bet most things worth training or prepping for are going to change life in most of the same ways: limited or no electricity, inconsistent water pressure and quality, uncontrolled structure fires, limited civil services, the list goes on.     Most of us here are working on kit for both, but would love to hear some unique perspectives on prepping or tactical gear that might be worth skipping, or things we absolutely should be saving for.

__label__1 As we dive into the legacy of Kevin Colbert and his time as the Steelers' GM, it's fascinating to look at the 176 draft picks he made and how they stack up in terms of normalized Approximate Value (AV). For those who may not be familiar, AV is a metric that attempts to summarize a player's contributions to their team in a single number, making it easier to compare players across different positions and eras.    Colbert's draft strategy has often been praised for its ability to find talent not just in the first round, but throughout the entire draft. When we normalize the AV of his picks, we can see which rounds have yielded the most value and which players have truly stood out.    For instance, players like Troy Polamalu and Ben Roethlisberger, both first-round picks, obviously have high AV scores, but what about the later rounds? Colbert has a knack for finding gems like Antonio Brown in the sixth round and Mike Hilton as an undrafted free agent. These players significantly boost the overall AV of Colbert's draft classes.    Analyzing the normalized AV can also highlight trends in Colbert's drafting philosophy. It seems that he has had particular success in the mid-rounds, where many teams often miss out on potential stars. This could be attributed to his scouting department's ability to identify talent that fits the Steelers' system, as well as Colbert's willingness to take calculated risks.    As we look ahead to the future, it will be interesting to see how the Steelers continue to build on this foundation. With the recent draft classes, it’s crucial to keep an eye on how these young players develop and contribute to the team's success.     What are your thoughts on Colbert's draft history? Which picks do you think have had the most impact? Let's discuss!

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m a rising 0L and I’m considering enrolling in a law school prep class or bootcamp before I start my 1L year. I’ve heard mixed reviews about these programs, and I’m curious if anyone here has experience with them.     Specifically, I’m looking for insights on:  1. **Effectiveness**: Did you find that the prep class helped you feel more prepared for the rigors of law school?   2. **Content**: What topics did the bootcamp cover? Was it mostly focused on legal writing, study strategies, or something else?   3. **Cost vs. Benefit**: Was the investment worth it?   4. **Recommendations**: Are there any specific programs you would recommend or advise against?     I want to make sure I’m as prepared as possible for this next chapter, but I also don’t want to waste time or money on something that isn’t beneficial. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been hearing a lot of chatter about Samsung's iris scanner technology and how it seems to be aging poorly. Can someone explain what the issues are with it? Is it a hardware problem, or is it more about software updates? I remember when it first came out, it was touted as a cutting-edge feature, but now it seems like people are having trouble with it. Are there specific models that are more affected than others? And what alternatives are people using now for biometric security?
__label__0 So me and my wife have a 17 year old son and daughter, so we're pretty busy with them and work and all.     We've been going through a busy few weeks recently and thus haven't been having very much sex. So my wife opted for a quickie this morning, but I rejected her.    I can tell she's  hurt because I usually am the one to initiate, but I'm just afraid she might not enjoy a quickie. We've never really had quickies, most of our sex is 30-60 minutes.    I've always heard, especially from women on reddit, that they want lots and lots of foreplay, they want the man to go slowly and not just jackhammer into them, they don't want the man to use them as a masturbation aid.    I feel like with a quickie, there'd be little to no foreplay for her, I'd just have to jackhammer to make it quick, and I'd pretty much be using her like a masturbation aid. I know she enjoys seeing my pleasure, and ofc I would enjoy it, but I'm just worried she won't enjoy quick sex.    Tl;dr: Women, do you really enjoy quickies, or do you just partake to please your man? Any and all advice is appreciated.
__label__1 I've been using the "Kukulkan's Wrath" hammer lately, and I have to say, it's quickly becoming my favorite! The design is just stunning, and the elemental damage it deals is a game changer in fights against monsters like Magnamalo and Goss Harag.     The ability to stun monsters with the charged attacks is so satisfying, especially when you see them stagger and fall over. Plus, the extra damage from the elemental effects really helps in those tougher hunts.     I also love how versatile the hammer is; I can switch between focusing on raw damage and elemental damage depending on the monster I'm facing.     What about you all? What’s your favorite hammer and why? Any specific builds or strategies you recommend? Let’s share some tips!

After the call i checked my stcpay account and it's all ok.    But the mobile number that they used to call me got blocked automatically. Maybe thats what he mean when he said i will be blocked 🤣    His number by the way is 0577613251    I already had a feeling that he is a scammer when i saw the mobile number then he introduced that he is from stcpay.

__label__1 I went to a wedding a few years ago where the couple decided to incorporate a unique theme: they were both huge fans of the 80s. The entire wedding was decked out in neon colors, and the guests were encouraged to dress in their best 80s attire.     The weirdest part, though, was during the ceremony. Instead of traditional vows, they had a karaoke machine set up and each of them sang their vows to the tune of popular 80s songs! The groom sang his vows to "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" by Whitney Houston, and the bride sang hers to "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper.     It was both hilarious and oddly touching to see them express their love through music. The guests were laughing and cheering, and it really set a fun tone for the rest of the night.     After the ceremony, they had a dance-off where guests could show off their best 80s dance moves, complete with a DJ spinning all the classic hits. It was definitely one of the most memorable weddings I've ever attended!     What about you? What’s the weirdest thing you’ve experienced at a wedding?

__label__1 Hey fellow rat lovers,    I wanted to reach out and see how many of you have had similar experiences with your female rats when it comes to vet bills. I’ve had my two girls for about six months now, and I’ve already spent over $500 on vet visits, treatments, and medications.     It all started with a respiratory infection that required multiple visits and antibiotics. Then, just when I thought we were in the clear, one of them developed a lump that needed to be checked out. Thankfully, it turned out to be benign, but the vet bills just keep piling up!     I’ve heard that female rats can be prone to certain health issues, and I’m starting to wonder if I should be budgeting more for their care. I love my girls to bits, but I didn’t expect the vet costs to be this high so soon.     So, how many of you have faced similar situations? Did you end up spending more than $500 in the first year? Any tips on how to manage these costs or prevent health issues would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!
__label__1 I recently received my MCAT score back, and I went from a 499 to a 514! I wanted to share my experience and some strategies that helped me make this significant jump in my score.     First off, I can't stress enough the importance of a structured study plan. I created a 3-month study schedule that included daily study blocks, practice tests, and review sessions. I used resources like Kaplan and the AAMC practice materials, which I found to be incredibly helpful.     One of the biggest changes I made was focusing on my weaknesses. After my first practice test, I identified the areas where I struggled the most and dedicated extra time to those subjects. I also incorporated Anki flashcards for active recall, which really helped reinforce my memory.     Another key aspect was taking full-length practice exams under timed conditions. This not only helped me get used to the test format but also improved my stamina for the actual exam day. I made sure to review each practice test thoroughly, analyzing my mistakes and understanding the reasoning behind the correct answers.     Lastly, I found it beneficial to join a study group. Discussing concepts with peers and teaching each other helped solidify my understanding and kept me motivated.     If anyone is looking to improve their score, I highly recommend focusing on a structured study plan, identifying weaknesses, and utilizing practice exams effectively. Good luck to everyone studying for the MCAT!

__label__0 Hello! I recently built a pc. I had 2 sticks of ram installed on the MOBO. They ran fine for a few weeks. Then my CPU cooler came in, so I replaced the stock cooler. It was slightly touching the RAM on one slot, so I swapped the ram from  A1/B1 to A2/B2. Then I ran some benchmarks, including memtest86 (mostly to see how my new cooler is performing). It showed 0 errors and all. But after that, the pc won't boot. 3 beeps and restart, up until it resets bios and in windows, I only see 8GB (1 stick) with the other 8GB being reserved for "hardware"? And also running at 1866MHz (its 3000mhz ddr4). I tried swapping back the slots, but still nothing. It boots with one stick at 2133 MHz (didn't even try turning on XMP), but not with the second. It's not the stick that was initially touching the CPU cooler.    One time it booted and showed 16GB, but shortly after a BSOD appeared "Attempted Write on Read Only Memory."    Edit: Solved by cleaning the CMOS
__label__1 I was scrolling through some old chapters of Chainsaw Man and came across a scene that really made me think. In Chapter 83, when Denji is fighting against the Chainsaw Devil, there's a moment where he seems to tap into a deeper level of his powers. It got me wondering if this has been discussed before or if anyone has any theories about what that means for his character development moving forward.     I know there are a lot of theories about Denji's connection to the Chainsaw Devil and how it might evolve, but I haven't seen much about this specific moment. Does anyone else remember this scene? What do you think it signifies?     Also, if this has been posted before, feel free to point me in the right direction! I’d love to dive deeper into this discussion.

What I remember is that it features a girl wearing a red dress or outfit, and there’s a guy on a beach. The vibe of the video was quite romantic or emotional. I think there was some kind of interaction between them, possibly a moment of connection or a dramatic scene. The beach setting was beautiful, with waves and maybe a sunset in the background.     I’m not sure if it was a short film or just a clip, but it really stood out to me. If anyone has seen something like this or knows what it might be, I would really appreciate your help!
__label__0 My 4 year old (soon to be 5) has just started primary school (UK) and she’s had this problem before after binge watching Frozen. But it’s starting to rear it’s ugly head again.       Basically she “wishes she was white” or “had blonde hair.” Any of you ladies had that problem?     There’s a lot of white girls in her class. I just want to celebrate her blackness but I don’t know how without being overbearing. Every minute I’m like let’s get the black doll or lets get that book with the girl that looks like you. Or let pick the movie about the little black girl.      I feel like I’m pushing her further away from it rather than helping her embrace it.    I want her to know that everyone is different and that she’s amazing and that she doesn’t have to look like them to be their friend or to be cool or interesting.     It’s started so early! Any advice ladies? And have any you had to deal with these comments from your girl child before? How did it pan out?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 35-year-old woman living in the U.S., and I find myself feeling a bit lonely lately. I’m looking to connect with new people and have some interesting conversations.

__label__0 my scenario: i have a room of modular assets i have made in the same file. i can edit the geometry of the original mesh and see it represented in all the linked assets.    However, applying modifiers is not possible to linked assets. i would have to unlink it, then apply the modifiers. then re-link all the objects in the scene back to the original asset.        This gets messy when you have a lot you will need to re-link. so my question is; is there an addon that automates this process? a button that checks all linked objects's meshes. unlinks, applies modifiers to selected object, and then re-links all the previously unlinked object's meshes?        I hope my description is clear enough.

__label__1 /r/worldnews      At least 8 people have been reported dead following a powerful earthquake that struck northeastern Afghanistan. The quake, which registered a magnitude of 6.1, hit the region early in the morning, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Rescue teams are currently working to reach affected areas, but challenging terrain and ongoing aftershocks are complicating efforts. Local authorities are urging residents to remain cautious as they assess the full extent of the damage. This disaster adds to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, where many are already struggling with food shortages and economic instability.

__label__0 I tried to google but I'm a confused expat and have issues understanding the magic of bureaucracy. I thought, maybe someone here who was in the same situation could help.  I am on parental leave and due to some shenanigans at my work I don't want to go back. I have the finances to stop working for a while, I know if I resign I won't get anything from unemployment. I took two months of parental leave. If I quit now and have 3 weeks notice period, does my parental leave end the moment I hand in my resignation? Or after the notice period? Or does it continue even if I am no longer employed?
__label__1 I've been playing a lot of Free For All (FFA) matches in Age of Empires IV lately, and I've noticed that teaming can really skew the balance of the game. It often leads to one or two players dominating the match while others are left to fend for themselves. I wanted to propose a potential solution to mitigate this issue and encourage more fair play.    What if we implemented a system where players could report teaming behavior? If a player is reported multiple times in a single match for teaming, they could receive a temporary matchmaking penalty or be placed in a separate queue for FFA games? This way, it would discourage players from forming alliances that disrupt the competitive nature of FFA.    Additionally, we could introduce a feature that randomly assigns players to different teams at the start of the match, making it impossible for players to coordinate with each other before the game begins. This could help create a more chaotic and unpredictable environment, which is part of the fun of FFA.    I'd love to hear your thoughts on this! Have you experienced issues with teaming in FFA? What solutions do you think could work to improve the experience for everyone?
__label__1 I just pulled my first dupe in Summoner's War, and I’m feeling a mix of excitement and confusion! I got a second Water Homunculus from a mystical scroll, and while I know it can be used to craft a different element, I’m not sure if I should go for it or keep it as is.     For those of you who have been in a similar situation, what do you recommend? Should I use the dupe to create a Fire or Wind Homunculus, or is it better to keep the Water one for its utility? I’m still working on building my team and figuring out the best strategies, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious lately, and I think I might need to get a professional diagnosis for my anxiety. I live in Canada, and I'm not sure where to start.     I've heard that I should see my family doctor first, but I'm worried about how to bring it up. What should I say? Do I need to prepare anything before the appointment?     Also, once I see my doctor, what can I expect in terms of the process? Will they refer me to a specialist, or can they diagnose me themselves?     Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful. I just want to make sure I'm taking the right steps to get the help I need.
__label__0 There's usually two radstags near the truck and the second one is almost always legendary.
__label__0 Before I was consistently going gym, I was slim, confident, a player who studied hard and wanted to be the best medical student. These days I am unmotivated, doing the same things every day, barely passing exams and I feel my brain rotting and wasting away with my body. I’m easily influenced by others and even my language has become unclear, lacking energy and confidence. I have become a “yes man”, something I was actually changing for the better the past two years. I feel stuck and I’m struggling to get back on the self improvement grind. I don’t know what stopped it but I suppose my outlook of the world has become less material and more spiritual so I’ve started to become detached from things that would benefit me in this life, as a result I’ve become less logical and some of my actions haven’t made sense to my once logical self and peers, the problem is that I’m now neglecting everything and its genuinely starting to impact me negatively, its hindering my potential. How do I get out of this cycle? Its horrible, I have barely seen the sun this year even and I’m sure thats partly why I’ve been feeling and doing crappy things.

__label__1 Hey everyone!     As we gear up for the Spring semester, I wanted to reach out to help our incoming exchange students find accommodation. I know how challenging it can be to secure a place to live, especially if you're coming from another country.     If you have any leads on available apartments, rooms for rent, or even if you're looking for a roommate to share a place with, please share your information here!     Additionally, if you have any tips on the best neighborhoods to live in or resources for finding housing, that would be super helpful too. Let's make sure our new Buckeyes feel welcome and have a smooth transition!     Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__0 In the C support between Hapi and Shamir, the latter states that the statue at the Abyssian Pagan Altar depicts a Dagdan Goddess, which she believes to be the goddess of fate.     No names provided and Shamir doesn’t know how it ended up there, but I found it to be an interesting tidbit of info and I wanted to share.
__label__1 I've been diving deep into astral projection lately, and while I've had some amazing experiences, I've also started to feel a bit uneasy about the possibility of others projecting into my space. I know that astral projection can be a very personal and private experience, and the thought of someone else potentially intruding on that is a bit unsettling.    I’ve read about various protective measures, but I’m curious to hear from the community about what has worked for you. Here are a few ideas I’ve come across:    1. **Setting Intentions**: Before I project, I plan to set a strong intention that my space is off-limits to others. I’ve heard that intentions can be powerful in the astral realm.    2. **Visualizing Barriers**: Some people suggest visualizing a protective barrier around your home or yourself before you project. This could be a light shield or a specific color that resonates with you.    3. **Using Crystals**: I’ve read that certain crystals, like black tourmaline or amethyst, can help create a protective energy. I’m considering placing them around my space or even carrying one with me when I project.    4. **Meditation and Grounding**: Regular meditation and grounding practices might help strengthen my energy field, making it less inviting for unwanted visitors.    5. **Calling on Spirit Guides**: I’ve heard that asking for protection from spirit guides or higher beings can be beneficial. I’m thinking of incorporating this into my pre-projection routine.    Has anyone here had experiences with unwanted astral visitors? What methods have you found effective in keeping your space safe? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any additional tips you might have! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I had a dream last night that was so vivid and strange, and while I was in it, everything made perfect sense. I was in this massive library that seemed to stretch on forever, filled with books that had titles in a language I couldn't recognize. I was wandering through the aisles, feeling this overwhelming urge to find a specific book that I just knew would hold the answers to some questions I had about my life.    In the dream, I was talking to this wise old librarian who was giving me advice about my future, and I felt like I was absorbing all this knowledge. I remember nodding along, feeling enlightened and ready to take on the world. But then, as soon as I woke up, it was like a fog rolled in. I couldn't remember a single piece of advice or even what the librarian looked like.     It’s so frustrating! I feel like I had this incredible insight that just slipped through my fingers the moment I opened my eyes. Has anyone else experienced this? It’s like my brain is playing tricks on me, giving me clarity in the dream world but leaving me in the dark when I wake up. What do you think causes this? Is it just the nature of dreams, or is there something deeper at play?

__label__1 Growing up, I was never the kid who had a dream job in mind. While my friends were busy saying they wanted to be astronauts, doctors, or famous athletes, I just kind of floated through life without any clear direction. I remember being asked in school what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I would just shrug and say, "I don’t know," or make up something silly like a dinosaur tamer.    Now that I’m older, I feel like I’m at a disadvantage compared to my peers who had a clear vision from a young age. I’ve tried a few different jobs and still haven’t found something that feels like the right fit. It’s frustrating because I see so many people who are passionate about their careers, and I can’t help but wonder if I missed out on something important by not having that childhood dream.    Does anybody else feel this way? Did you also grow up without a specific career goal in mind, and how has that affected you as an adult?
__label__0 This is my first time watching Westworld and have just gotten to this episode.    I have not ever been overly impressed by individual performances in this show, bar a few small spots. After the riddle of the sphinx episode and this one, I can say hands down I'm very invested. Please don't spoil the content coming forward.    That being said, this episode had me bawling. The sheer performance of the main actor in this episode was phenomenal. The beautiful long shots framed with intimate and painful searching for their own hope.  The reunion of &gt;!kohana and Ake, and the reveal that several hosts had begun to become aware a while before Delores was, without much intervention from outsiders.  !&lt;    Did anyone else end up sobbing?

__label__1 Hey everyone! I have a couple of items up for sale or trade today.    First up is the Civivi Bull Mastiff. This knife has been a great EDC for me, but I’m looking to switch things up. The blade is in excellent condition with only minor signs of use. It has been sharpened once and is super sharp. The action is smooth, and the lockup is solid. Comes with the original box and paperwork.     **Price:** $55 PayPal’d and shipped CONUS.     Next, I have a set of Black G10 scales for the Para 3. These scales are in great condition, having been installed but never carried. They give the knife a nice, sleek look and feel. Comes with all the necessary screws for installation.     **Price:** $30 PayPal’d and shipped CONUS.     I’m also open to trades! Looking for other knives or gear, so feel free to send me your offers.     Timestamp and pics can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/yourlinkhere     Thanks for looking! Please no notes in PayPal.

__label__0 Curious as to what you guys think any of this stuff is worth.     -1400 rounds (or so) of ChinaSport 762 from norinco total. 2 unopened spam cans still in unopened crate. 500rds in boxes with zero corrosion.     - Norinco SKS with bayonet and standard fixed mag (looks like it's been fired 1 or 2 times).   - Norinco SKS with no bayonet but 30 rd fixed mag (also basically looks unfired)    Both rifles have cleaning rods. All original matching numbers. My dad bought it all pre clinton ban 30 years ago and wants to sell it all as he isnt a collector and has other firearms for preparedness.    Before anyone else says it, I dont think he should sell it. But hes dead set on getting rid of all the chinese stuff because its priced so well nowadays for sellers.
__label__0 TLDR: Felt Euphoric because I walked a college student to their housing (and felt like a gentleman).    I am currently a freshman in college, and I had stopped to check traffic, (before crossing the street) when a freshman came up to me, and asked if I was a student of the same college, I said that I was and they asked for directions back to their housing. I offered to show them how to get back (we were about 4 blocks away and I didn't want them to have to take the walk back alone.) We made it back safely and I was just filled with happiness at the fact that I got to do this (at least to me) gentleman like thing. I realize she asked me because she thought I was an upper classmates but still the euphoria
__label__1 I thought it would be fun to start a thread where we can share some simple but interesting little kinks that we might not usually talk about. These can be things that are easy to incorporate into your sex life or just little quirks that you find intriguing. Here are a few of mine:    1. **Whispering** - There's something incredibly intimate about whispering sweet nothings or even dirty talk in your partner's ear. It creates a sense of closeness and can heighten arousal.    2. **Role Reversal** - Sometimes, switching up the traditional roles in the bedroom can be exciting. Whether it's the more dominant partner taking a backseat or trying out a different dynamic, it can lead to some surprising experiences.    3. **Food Play** - Using food in a playful way can be a fun kink. Whether it’s chocolate syrup, whipped cream, or even just feeding each other, it adds a sensory element that can be really enjoyable.    4. **Public Displays of Affection** - Not necessarily full-on sex, but the thrill of a little PDA can be a huge turn-on. A quick kiss or a subtle touch in a public place can create a rush of excitement.    5. **Costumes** - Dressing up in costumes or themed outfits can add a fun twist to your usual routine. It can be anything from sexy nurse to superhero, and it allows for a bit of fantasy play.    I’d love to hear what little kinks you all have! Let’s share and maybe inspire each other to try something new!
__label__1 I'm relatively new to the world of bondage and I'm looking for some tips and references to help me get started safely and effectively. I want to explore this aspect of BDSM with my partner, but I want to make sure we approach it with care and respect for each other's boundaries.    Here are a few specific areas where I could use some guidance:    1. **Safety First**: What are the essential safety precautions I should take when practicing bondage? Are there specific tools or equipment that are safer than others?    2. **Types of Bondage**: I’ve heard about different styles like rope bondage, cuffs, and even more elaborate setups. What are some beginner-friendly techniques or styles that you recommend?    3. **Communication**: How do I ensure that my partner and I are on the same page about our limits and desires? What are some effective ways to discuss boundaries before we start?    4. **Resources**: Are there any books, websites, or videos that you would recommend for someone just starting out? I’m looking for both instructional content and also material that covers the psychological aspects of bondage.    5. **Aftercare**: What should I keep in mind for aftercare once the bondage session is over? How can I make sure my partner feels safe and cared for afterward?    I appreciate any advice or resources you can share! Thank you!
__label__1 I'm in a bit of a pickle with my RB2 and Flex spots this week. I have a few options to choose from, and I could use some advice on who to start.     Here are my candidates:    **RB2 Options:**    1. **James Robinson (JAX)** - He’s been getting a decent amount of touches and has a favorable matchup against a weak run defense.    2. **Chase Edmonds (MIA)** - He’s been involved in the passing game, but the Dolphins' backfield is a bit crowded.    3. **Khalil Herbert (CHI)** - He’s been solid when given the opportunity, but the Bears' offense is inconsistent.      **Flex Options:**    1. **Michael Gallup (DAL)** - He’s been getting more targets lately, and the Cowboys are facing a defense that struggles against the pass.    2. **Darnell Mooney (CHI)** - He’s the top receiver for the Bears, but can I trust him with their QB situation?    3. **Rondale Moore (ARI)** - He’s been a bit hit or miss, but he has big-play potential.      Given my options, who would you start as my RB2 and Flex? Any insights on matchups or recent performances would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been trying to make my taskbar invisible in Windows 10 for a cleaner desktop experience, but I'm not sure how to go about it. I know there's an option to auto-hide the taskbar, but I want it completely invisible unless I hover over the area where it usually is.     I've tried the following steps:  1. Right-click on the taskbar and select "Taskbar settings."  2. Turn on "Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode."    However, it still shows a slight shadow or outline when I hover over it. Is there a way to make it completely disappear?     Also, if anyone has any tips on customizing the desktop further or using third-party software to achieve a more minimalistic look, I would love to hear those suggestions too! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I finally feel ready to take the plunge. I've been using weed as a crutch for too long, and it's time to let it go. I’ve had some great times, but I’ve also experienced the downsides: missed opportunities, strained relationships, and a general feeling of stagnation in my life.     I’ve tried to quit before, but I always found a reason to go back. This time feels different, though. I’ve had some serious moments of reflection, and I realize that I want more for myself. I want to be present in my life, to pursue my passions, and to build meaningful connections with the people around me.     I know it won’t be easy, and I’m sure there will be challenges ahead. But I’m committed to this journey. I plan to take it one day at a time, focusing on healthier habits and finding new ways to cope with stress. I’m also considering joining a support group to help keep me accountable.    If anyone has tips or experiences to share, I’d love to hear them. I’m ready to embrace this change and see where it takes me. Here’s to new beginnings!     Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support you can offer.
__label__1 and honestly, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it! I thought it was just going to be a cheesy robot fighting movie, but it had a lot of heart and some really cool themes about family and redemption.     The relationship between Hugh Jackman's character and his son was really touching, and I loved how they bonded over the robot boxing. Plus, the robot designs were super cool! I mean, who wouldn't want to see giant robots duke it out in the ring?     It got me thinking about how sometimes we underestimate movies based on their premise. Have you guys ever watched a movie that you thought would be bad but ended up loving? What are some of your favorite unexpected gems?

__label__1 I just finished watching "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story" and I couldn't help but notice the product placement throughout the series. It felt really out of place, especially given the dark and serious subject matter. For instance, there were several scenes where characters were using specific brands of snacks and drinks, and it felt like they were trying to sell us something rather than focusing on the story.    I get that product placement is a common practice in TV shows and movies, but in a series that deals with such heavy themes, it just felt jarring. It took me out of the moment and made me question the authenticity of the storytelling.     Am I the only one who feels this way? What do you all think about product placement in shows like this? Does it enhance the viewing experience for you, or does it detract from the narrative?

__label__1 Hey fellow tree enthusiasts! 🌳    I wanted to share my experience with obtaining a medical marijuana card in Florida, as I know it can be a bit of a maze for some folks.     First off, you need to have a qualifying medical condition. Some of the common ones include chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, and epilepsy, but there are others too. I recommend checking the Florida Department of Health's website for the full list.    Once you confirm you have a qualifying condition, the next step is to find a licensed physician who can evaluate you. I found a great clinic that specializes in medical marijuana evaluations. The appointment was pretty straightforward; the doctor asked about my medical history and how my condition affects my daily life.     After the evaluation, if the doctor thinks you qualify, they will enter your information into the Medical Marijuana Use Registry. You’ll then need to pay a fee to the state for your card, which is around $75.     Once your application is approved, you’ll receive your card in the mail, and then you’re all set to visit dispensaries! I was super excited to finally have access to legal cannabis.     Just a heads up, the process can take a few weeks, so be patient! And remember, always follow the laws and regulations in Florida regarding medical marijuana.     If anyone has questions or needs more details about the process, feel free to ask! Happy to help! 🌿✨

__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently found myself with a lot of free time after losing my job due to the pandemic, and I've decided to channel that energy into starting a YouTube channel focused on gaming, specifically Apex Legends.

I would really appreciate any feedback on my videos, whether it's about my gameplay, commentary, or video editing. I'm eager to improve and grow, so any tips or constructive criticism would be super helpful!     Thanks for taking the time to check out my content, and I hope you all stay safe out there!

__label__1 Hey everyone! I've been lurking here for a while, but I finally decided to jump in and share my experience. I'm currently on the 72nd hour of my eurospeed journey, and it's been quite the ride!     For those who might not know, eurospeed is a method I use to help manage my stimming behaviors. It involves a mix of sensory activities that keep me engaged and focused. I find that it really helps me channel my energy in a positive way.     So far, I've been experimenting with different textures and sounds, and I’ve found a few favorites that really help me feel grounded. I love the feeling of soft fabrics and the sound of gentle rain in the background. It’s like a little cocoon of comfort!     How is everyone else doing? Any tips or favorite stims you’d like to share? I’d love to hear what works for you all!

__label__1 I've been playing a lot of Star Wars Battlefront II lately, and I've been focusing on mastering Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker. Here are some tips that I've found helpful for each character:    **Count Dooku:**    1. **Use your abilities wisely:** Dooku's abilities are great for dealing damage and controlling the battlefield. His Lightning Strike can stun enemies, so try to use it when you have multiple opponents in front of you.   2. **Master the dueling mechanic:** Dooku excels in one-on-one duels. Use his lightsaber abilities to outmaneuver your opponent. Remember to block and dodge effectively to avoid taking damage.   3. **Stay mobile:** Dooku is not the tankiest character, so keep moving to avoid getting overwhelmed. Use his speed to your advantage and try to flank enemies.  4. **Utilize the Force:** His Force Choke can be a game-changer in tight situations. Use it to isolate and eliminate key targets quickly.    **Anakin Skywalker:**    1. **Aggressive playstyle:** Anakin is a powerhouse. Don’t be afraid to charge into battle and take on multiple enemies. His abilities allow him to sustain damage while dealing it out.  2. **Use his abilities strategically:** Anakin's abilities can turn the tide of battle. His Charge ability can close the gap quickly, while his Heroic Might can knock back enemies and create space for you to breathe.  3. **Focus on objectives:** Anakin is great for capturing objectives due to his high damage output and survivability. Use him to push forward and secure points.  4. **Watch your health:** While Anakin can take a lot of damage, he can still be taken down quickly if you’re not careful. Keep an eye on your health and retreat if necessary to heal up.    Overall, both characters have unique strengths that can be leveraged in different situations. Practice makes perfect, so keep playing and experimenting with their abilities! What are your favorite strategies when playing as Dooku or Anakin?

__label__1 Switching from WhatsApp Plus back to the regular WhatsApp can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to backing up your chats. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:    1. **Backup Your Chats in WhatsApp Plus**:       - Open WhatsApp Plus and go to **Settings**.       - Navigate to **Chats** and then select **Backup Chats**.       - This will create a backup of your chats in the internal storage of your device.    2. **Locate the Backup File**:       - Use a file manager app to navigate to the folder where WhatsApp Plus stores its backups. This is usually found in `Internal Storage/WhatsApp/Databases/`.       - Look for files named like `msgstore.db.crypt12` or similar.       - Copy this backup file to a safe location, such as your computer or a cloud storage service.    3. **Uninstall WhatsApp Plus**:       - Before installing the regular WhatsApp, uninstall WhatsApp Plus from your device.       - Make sure to confirm that you have backed up your chats before doing this.    4. **Install Regular WhatsApp**:       - Download and install the official WhatsApp from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.    5. **Restore Your Chats**:       - Open WhatsApp and verify your phone number.       - After verification, WhatsApp will prompt you to restore your chat history from a backup.       - If it doesn’t automatically find the backup, you may need to move the backup file you saved earlier into the `Internal Storage/WhatsApp/Databases/` folder.       - Once the file is in the correct location, restart WhatsApp and it should detect the backup.    6. **Complete the Setup**:       - Follow the prompts to restore your chats. Once completed, you should see all your previous messages in the regular WhatsApp.    7. **Check for Missing Media**:       - Sometimes media files may not transfer over. Check your media folder to see if everything is intact. If not, you may need to manually transfer media files from the WhatsApp Plus folder.    By following these steps, you should be able to successfully backup and restore your chats when switching from WhatsApp Plus to the regular WhatsApp. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help!
__label__1 I was in high school, and there was this one kid who loved to pull pranks. One day, he decided to take it a step further. He knew I was really into this girl in our class, and he thought it would be hilarious to make me look foolish in front of her.    So, during lunch, he snuck up behind me and dumped a whole tray of mashed potatoes on my head while I was talking to her. Everyone burst out laughing, and I was mortified. I stood there, covered in potatoes, while my crush tried to stifle her laughter.     But here’s the twist: instead of being angry, I just started laughing too. I made a joke about how I was now the "mashed potato king" and even did a little dance. Surprisingly, my crush found it funny and ended up talking to me more after that.     In the end, the prank backfired on him because it made me more relatable and even got me a date with her! So, while it was meant to be mean, it turned into one of the funniest and most memorable moments of my high school life.

__label__1 In a world where emotions are traded like currency, a young woman named Elara finds herself in a precarious situation. She works at the Emotion Exchange, a bustling marketplace where people come to buy and sell their feelings. Joy, sadness, anger, and love are all commodities, and the more intense the emotion, the higher the price.    Elara has always been a skilled trader, able to sense the emotions of others and negotiate the best deals. However, she harbors a secret: she has never sold her own emotions. Instead, she hoards them, afraid of losing the very essence of who she is. Her collection includes the vibrant hues of joy from her childhood, the deep blues of sorrow from her first heartbreak, and the fiery reds of anger from her struggles with her family.    One day, a mysterious stranger named Kael enters the Emotion Exchange. He is unlike anyone Elara has ever met; he radiates a powerful aura of confidence and charisma. Intrigued, she watches as he effortlessly trades his emotions, drawing a crowd and making a fortune. But as she observes him, she notices something unsettling: he seems to be devoid of any true feelings.     Curiosity piqued, Elara approaches Kael, and they strike up a conversation. He reveals that he has mastered the art of emotional manipulation, allowing him to project feelings without actually experiencing them. He offers to teach her his techniques, promising that she could become the most successful trader in the market.     Elara is torn. The allure of wealth and success is tempting, but she fears losing her authentic self in the process. As she grapples with her decision, she begins to notice the consequences of Kael's lifestyle. People around him are drawn in, but they leave feeling empty and unfulfilled.     Determined to find a balance, Elara proposes a deal to Kael: she will teach him the value of genuine emotions in exchange for his knowledge of emotional manipulation. Reluctantly, he agrees, and together they embark on a journey to explore the depths of their feelings.     As they delve deeper, Elara learns to embrace her emotions, trading them not for profit but for connection. She discovers that true wealth lies not in the quantity of emotions traded but in the quality of experiences shared. Kael, on the other hand, begins to understand the beauty of vulnerability and the strength that comes from feeling deeply.     In the end, they create a new kind of exchange, one that values authenticity over profit. The Emotion Exchange transforms into a sanctuary where people come not to trade their feelings but to share their stories, fostering genuine connections and healing. Elara and Kael, now partners in both business and life, realize that the most valuable currency of all is love.
__label__0 My parents own a condo in downtown Toronto. Since I just graduated and will no longer stay in Toronto, they have been trying to sell the condo since beginning of August. We are not in need of money currently but my parents' first thought was that by selling the condo, they could just put the money into the bank and grew it through interest. However, the offers that came in are all significantly lower than what they wish for. They thought about renting it out instead given the current rental market but worry about potential messy tenant situations.     Would you just take the low offer and invest the money elsewhere or rent the condo out? Any suggestions are welcome!     If needed, I am willing to provide more details!

__label__1 I have an 8-hour layover in Bucharest and I'm looking for suggestions on how to make the most of my time in the city. I’d love to explore some local culture, try some traditional Romanian food, and see a few key sights.     Here’s what I’m thinking:    1. **Start at the Palace of the Parliament** - This massive building is one of the largest in the world and a must-see. I’ve heard the guided tours are fascinating, so I’d like to spend about an hour here.    2. **Stroll through the Old Town (Lipscani)** - After the palace, I’d head to the Old Town to wander the charming streets, check out the architecture, and maybe stop for a coffee at one of the many cafes. I’ve read that the atmosphere is vibrant, especially during the day.    3. **Lunch at a local restaurant** - I want to try some traditional Romanian dishes. Any recommendations for a good place to eat? I’m particularly interested in trying sarmale (cabbage rolls) and mămăligă (polenta).    4. **Visit the Romanian Athenaeum** - This beautiful concert hall is iconic in Bucharest. I’d love to take some photos and maybe catch a glimpse of a performance if there’s one happening.    5. **Explore the Village Museum** - If time allows, I’d like to visit this open-air museum that showcases traditional Romanian village life. It seems like a great way to learn about the country’s history and culture.    6. **Relax in a park** - If I have some time left, I’d love to unwind in one of Bucharest’s parks, like Herăstrău Park, before heading back to the airport.    Does this itinerary sound feasible? Any other must-see spots or hidden gems I should consider? Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I've been experimenting with different sidearms in Red Dead Online, and I wanted to get the community's take on what the best "quick fire" sidearm is.     For me, the Mauser Pistol has been a game-changer. Its rapid-fire capability allows me to take down enemies quickly, especially in PvP situations. The accuracy is decent, and the damage output is solid for a sidearm. Plus, the reload speed isn't too bad either, which is crucial when you're in the heat of battle.    I've also heard some players swear by the Semi-Automatic Pistol for its high rate of fire and stopping power. It seems like a great choice for those who prefer a more aggressive playstyle.    What do you all think? Do you have a favorite sidearm for quick draws? Any tips on how to maximize their effectiveness in combat? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 In my worldbuilding project, I'm exploring the idea of a catastrophic event that stems from the societal pursuits of different civilizations. I want to create a rich narrative that intertwines the ambitions and desires of these societies with the eventual downfall they face. Here are a few societal pursuits that could lead to a catastrophe:    1. **Technological Advancement**: A society that is obsessed with technological progress might develop a powerful energy source that, while initially beneficial, becomes unstable. This could lead to a catastrophic explosion or environmental disaster, forcing the civilization to confront the consequences of their relentless pursuit of innovation without regard for safety.    2. **Resource Exploitation**: A civilization that prioritizes economic growth over environmental sustainability could deplete natural resources to the point of collapse. This could manifest as a severe drought, famine, or even a mass migration of people as they search for habitable land, leading to conflict with neighboring societies.    3. **Cultural Supremacy**: A society that believes in its cultural superiority might engage in aggressive expansionism, leading to wars and the subjugation of other cultures. The backlash from these oppressed societies could result in a united front against the aggressor, leading to a catastrophic war that reshapes the world.    4. **Religious Zealotry**: A civilization driven by extreme religious beliefs might pursue a cataclysmic event, believing it to be a divine prophecy. This could involve rituals or wars intended to bring about an apocalyptic scenario, ultimately leading to their own destruction as they misinterpret signs and push their beliefs to the extreme.    5. **Isolationism**: A society that isolates itself from the rest of the world in pursuit of self-sufficiency might neglect advancements in medicine, technology, and diplomacy. When a pandemic or natural disaster strikes, their lack of preparedness could lead to widespread devastation, showcasing the dangers of extreme isolation.    6. **Artistic Pursuit**: A civilization that places immense value on artistic expression might push the boundaries of creativity to dangerous levels, leading to societal chaos. For example, a movement that encourages extreme forms of performance art could spiral out of control, resulting in public unrest or even violence.    Each of these pursuits can serve as a foundation for a rich narrative, exploring themes of ambition, hubris, and the consequences of societal choices. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on these ideas! What societal pursuits do you think could lead to a catastrophe in your own worldbuilding? Any additional suggestions or examples would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 1440p gaming has been a hot topic in the gaming community lately, and for good reason! As someone who recently upgraded from 1080p to 1440p, I can confidently say that it has been a game changer for my overall gaming experience.    First off, the visual clarity at 1440p is noticeably better. Textures are sharper, and the details in environments are much more pronounced. This is especially true in open-world games where you can appreciate the vastness and intricacies of the landscapes. Games like "Cyberpunk 2077" and "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" look absolutely stunning at this resolution.    Another significant advantage is the increased screen real estate. With a higher resolution, I can have multiple windows open while gaming or streaming without feeling cramped. This is a huge plus for multitaskers or those who enjoy streaming their gameplay.    Performance-wise, 1440p can be demanding, but with the right hardware, it can be a sweet spot between 1080p and 4K. Many modern GPUs handle 1440p quite well, allowing for high frame rates without sacrificing too much graphical fidelity. This is particularly important for competitive gamers who rely on smooth gameplay.    However, it’s worth noting that not everyone may find 1440p necessary. If you’re primarily playing fast-paced competitive games, 1080p might still be the way to go for the highest frame rates. But for those who enjoy immersive single-player experiences or visually stunning titles, 1440p is definitely worth considering.    In conclusion, 1440p is indeed a big game changer for many gamers. It strikes a balance between performance and visual fidelity that enhances the overall gaming experience. What are your thoughts? Have you made the switch to 1440p, and if so, how has it changed your gaming experience?

__label__1 Rejection can be a tough situation for both parties involved, and it's great that you're considering the other person's feelings. Here are some tips on how to reject someone gently and respectfully:    1. **Be Honest but Kind**: It's important to be truthful about your feelings, but you can do so in a way that is compassionate. You might say something like, "I really appreciate your interest, but I don’t feel a romantic connection."    2. **Choose the Right Setting**: If possible, have the conversation in a private or low-pressure environment. This can help minimize any embarrassment and allows for a more sincere discussion.    3. **Use "I" Statements**: Frame your rejection in a way that focuses on your feelings rather than their shortcomings. For example, "I’m not in a place to pursue a relationship right now" instead of "You’re not my type."    4. **Be Direct but Gentle**: Avoid beating around the bush. Being clear about your feelings can prevent misunderstandings, but do it in a gentle manner.     5. **Acknowledge Their Feelings**: Let them know that you understand this might be disappointing for them. A simple, "I know this might not be what you wanted to hear, and I’m sorry if it hurts" can go a long way.    6. **Offer Friendship (if appropriate)**: If you genuinely want to remain friends, you can express that. However, be mindful that they may need some space to process their feelings first.    7. **Be Prepared for Their Reaction**: Understand that they may feel hurt or upset. Give them the space to express their feelings, but also be firm in your decision.    Ultimately, the key is to be respectful and considerate. Rejection is never easy, but handling it with empathy can help both of you move on without unnecessary embarrassment.

__label__1 I get it, the "no kids" rule at dispensaries and cannabis events can be super frustrating. I mean, why should parents have to miss out on enjoying cannabis just because they have kids? It feels like a double standard when you can take your kids to bars or other adult spaces but not to a place where people are just trying to chill and enjoy some herb.     I understand the reasoning behind it—safety, liability, and all that—but it seems a bit extreme. Cannabis is becoming more normalized, and it would be nice to see more places accommodating families.     Plus, it could be a great opportunity for education! Imagine a space where parents could bring their kids and have open conversations about cannabis in a safe environment. Instead of hiding it away, we could be teaching the next generation about responsible use and the benefits of cannabis.     Anyone else feel the same way? What are your thoughts on this? Should we push for more inclusive spaces or just accept the rules as they are?
__label__0 I'am wondering, i saw many posts here talking about mental health today.

Honestly why they dont go fight and settle this bs themselves? The draft should be made worldwide illegal and all men should refuse to fight and contribute to this madness.

__label__1 I recently picked up this painting at a tag sale for just $2, and I'm curious to know more about it. I believe it's an original painting rather than a print, but I'm not entirely sure. The style and colors caught my eye, and I couldn't resist the price!     I've done a bit of research but haven't found much information about the artist or the piece itself. If anyone recognizes the signature or has any insights into the painter or the painting's history, I would greatly appreciate your help!     Here’s a photo of the painting: [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/example)      Thanks in advance for any information you can provide!
__label__0 They all seemed kind of shady.
__label__0 (Background: Currently living with In-Laws)    MIL complained about the smell of food coming from the kitchen. I had the range hood on, a separate fan, and the window open. She was in living room, directly by the kitchen. I wasn't making anything unusual or pungent, just steak and potatoes.    This is after she LITERALLY cried a few months ago because I "don't know how to cook". I do know how to cook. It's just a nightmare cooking with her around. I'm just trying to minimize my negative interactions by not cooking. She thought it was horrible DH does all the cooking and fears I wouldn't be able to "take care" of DH. DH's hobby is cooking. We used to cook together, but if we are both in the kitchen talking to each other our conversation is monitored and interrupted by MIL while she sits in the living room. It's not as fun if you have to be silent the whole time just for some peace.    I offered to make dinner to help out (and prove I could cook) and was flat out rejected because of fear I would make food too spicy. They looked HORRIFIED at the idea of eating anything I made. The concept of using anything other than Salt, pepper, and (if you're feeling adventurous) paprika, is strange and unusual for them.    The day before she made a "vegetable soup" that smelled and looked like vomit. It was so vile it woke me up out of my sleep. My room is the furthest from the kitchen, on a complete different floor.    Dreaming for the day I have my own kitchen 🥲
__label__0 I liked the system with you having to watch facial expressions to determine wether the person is lying or not. I also liked the system with using clues to determined wether someone is lying or not.     Does anyone know of detective games using either or both features?
__label__0 This has been driving me mad for the last few days, but im trying to remember this Horror film i watched ages ago. It's about a mother and her two daughters who move away to another house. On the way there, there's this old couple in (i think) an ice cream van who give them the finger. Later on, the same old man of the two in the van is in the basement dragging one of the daughters away.    That's all i remember!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m in a bit of a confusing situation with my girlfriend, and I could really use some outside perspective. We’ve been together for about a year now, and for the most part, things have been great. However, I recently found out that she wasn’t completely honest with me about her past relationship.    When we first started dating, she told me that her ex-boyfriend was a guy she had a pretty casual relationship with and that they had broken up on good terms. I accepted that and didn’t think much of it. But a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon some old social media posts of hers that showed a different side of their relationship. It turns out they were together for a lot longer than she initially let on, and they had a pretty serious relationship.    I confronted her about it, and she admitted that she downplayed their relationship because she didn’t want me to feel insecure or threatened. She said she thought it would be easier for me to accept if she made it seem less significant. I understand her reasoning, but I can’t help but feel hurt that she felt the need to lie about it in the first place.    I love her and I want to move past this, but I’m struggling with trust now. I’m worried that if she could hide something like this, what else might she be keeping from me? I’ve expressed my feelings to her, and she’s been very apologetic, but I’m still feeling uneasy.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I really want to work through this, but I’m not sure how to rebuild that trust. Any advice would be appreciated.    Thanks for reading.
__label__1 It's funny how we often rely on our "gut feelings" to make decisions, as if our instincts are some kind of ancient wisdom. But really, it's just our brain's way of saying, "I can't remember the math behind this, so let's wing it!" Maybe we should start calling it what it really is: a lack of data.      In a world where we have access to so much information, trusting our gut might just be a fancy way of admitting we forgot to do our homework.
__label__1 What a wild weekend in the NFL! The Baltimore Ravens had a commanding 20-point lead against the Buffalo Bills, and somehow, they let it slip away. It just goes to show that in this league, no lead is safe. The Bills came roaring back, and it was a reminder of how quickly things can change in a game.     As Jaguars fans, we know all too well the feeling of watching a lead evaporate, but it’s also a testament to the resilience of teams like the Bills. They didn’t give up and fought back to secure the win.     It’s moments like these that make the NFL so unpredictable and exciting. Can’t wait to see how our Jags respond in their next game! Let’s keep building on our momentum and show the league what we’re made of! #DUUUVAL
__label__0 I’ve been clean and sober off of all drugs and alcohol for over 5 years now. I have been wanting to use mushrooms for spiritual enhancement. I did so about a 5 weeks ago. I took .66 grams of chocolate. I had some visuals and felt good but was able to maintain a grip on reality as well. I have since took .33 twice and it equated to mild body buzz and feelings of gratitude and well being. My wife has participated in two of the experiences and she is also in long term recovery. I have not felt the need or desire to ever return to alcohol of opiates whatsoever. Which I’m very happy about. I did like the effects the mushrooms produced but I know it’s not something I can do all the time nor would I want to. I personally don’t feel like guilty like I violated my recovery, I know other more judgmental people in the “program” would have different opinions for sure. I guess it’s no one’s business but my own. Anyways thoughts and feelings appreciated

__label__1 I'm looking to start a new workout routine and I'm wondering what the best websites or apps are for getting a gym program. Ideally, I want something that can cater to my fitness level and goals, whether it's building muscle, losing weight, or improving overall fitness.     I've heard of a few options like MyFitnessPal, Fitbod, and JEFIT, but I'm curious about what others have found effective. Do any of you have personal experiences with these or other platforms? What features do you think are essential in a gym program app? Thanks in advance for your recommendations!
__label__1 I know it sounds unbelievable, but I was pronounced dead for over an hour before miraculously coming back to life. It was a surreal experience that changed my perspective on life, death, and everything in between.

Whether you're curious about the medical side of things, my personal journey, or even the philosophical questions that arise from such an event, feel free to ask me anything!     I'm here to answer your questions and share my story.
__label__1 I recently noticed that my posts aren't getting any engagement, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been shadowbanned. I've tried posting a few times over the last week, but it seems like no one is seeing my content. I followed all the rules and guidelines, but I can't shake the feeling that something is off. Has anyone else experienced this? What are some signs that you might be shadowbanned? Any tips on how to check or resolve this issue? Thanks!
__label__0 I (17F) ghosted my best friend (also 17F) for being fatphobic and making fun of me. So basically what happened is that since the beginning of our friendship, this person liked to tease me a lot for my interests. I met this person last school year, so we haven’t been friends for very long, but we also got close really fast. However, as we got closer, I realized my friend was also being very fatphobic to my other best friend. (We’ll call her Lilly)     Lilly was my first friend when I moved to the district and she’s been nothing but nice to me. However, Lilly has always been made fun of for her weight, and my friend added a lot to this problem. My friend (who is skinny) would always make fun of her for wearing bigger sizes than the rest of the group and would call themselves fat in front of Lilly. Eventually, Lilly and some other people left the friend group, leaving only me and my friend in the group. Around 2 months later I found out about the fatphobic behavior and confronted them. They went on to say that “Lilly calls everyone fatphobic!!” and proceeded to make fun of her weight.     I was planning on dropping them right then and there, but in May of this year we had a sports camp together that we were roommates for, so I couldn’t just drop them then. Time went on and I kept confronting them on their behavior towards Lilly after she told me my friend made them not want to go to school and work due to how they made her feel. Again, my friend kept denying being fatphobic towards Lilly and said that Lilly is trying to victimize herself.     When camp was over, I was really rethinking being friends with someone like them, so I told Lilly I was planning to drop them. Lilly approved, so around a week ago I dropped them. Now they and their gf are spam calling my phone and asking what they ever did to deserve this. I have called them out on their behavior numerous times and they refuse to listen to me. So should I have dropped them?    tl;dr - Best friend was being fatphobic and rude, I ghosted them
__label__1 I've been dating this girl for a few months now, and things have been going really well. We have a lot in common, and I genuinely enjoy spending time with her. Recently, during one of our dates, we were sitting on a bench and she reached over to hold my hand. As we were sitting there, she intertwined her fingers with mine, and it felt really nice.     I've heard that interlocking fingers can be a sign of intimacy and connection, but I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into it. I mean, we’ve been affectionate before, but this felt different. It was like a moment of vulnerability and closeness.     I guess my question is, does interlocking fingers usually mean something more serious? Should I take this as a sign that she’s really into me, or is it just a casual thing? I want to make sure I’m not overthinking it, but I also don’t want to miss any signals she might be sending.     What do you all think? Have you experienced something similar? How did you interpret it?
__label__0 Would love to find Melba!! Let me know what you’re looking for!
__label__1 I played a round yesterday and decided to give the Aimpoint method a shot for the first time. I’ve heard a lot about it and wanted to see if it could help improve my putting. I watched a few videos beforehand and tried to grasp the basics, but I still felt a bit lost on the course.    Here’s what I did: I tried to read the greens by feeling the slope with my feet and using the Aimpoint system to determine the break. I marked my ball and took my time, but I still struggled with the actual execution. I missed a few putts that I thought I had read correctly, and it was a bit frustrating.    For those of you who are experienced with Aimpoint, I’d love some detailed tips on how to improve my reading and execution. Specifically:  1. How do you determine the right amount of break for different lengths of putts?  2. Any tips on how to better feel the slope with my feet?  3. How do you practice this method effectively off the course?    I’m really eager to get better at this, as I believe it could really help my game. Thanks in advance for any advice!
__label__0 TL:DR at the bottom.      I have been living without heating or air in my house since November 17 of 2021. The initial company that came out deemed that my HVAC unit would need to be replaced. When running the new duct work and wiring, they said there was raw sewage leaking under my house. We had several plumbers come out over a 2 month span and deem that there was no sewage leaking, just a bit of moisture collection.       &amp;#x200B;    The heating company eventually dropped the contract and refused to do any work on our unit no matter what. This began a long string of phone calls where I called my land lord everyday. Each day, a new representative would answer and I would have to re explain the entire situation. These people always reassured me that something would be done but nothing ever came of all those calls and hours upon hours spent on hold.       &amp;#x200B;    In March, I resigned the lease, stupidly, because I did not have the financial means to move out of the house at that time. They increased my rent by $120. I have paid my rent in full and on time each month.      &amp;#x200B;    It is now mid July, and I still have zero capability to heat or cool my home. I purchased and installed window units in desperation to try and combat the heat. These window units have shorted the wiring in the house. I called in a maintenance order for that. When the tech came, a tech employed directly by the company, he said there was nothing he could do and that we should just move out. He said the landlord has no intention of putting any more money into this house because they plan on gutting it when we leave. He implied that this is a way for them to push us out of the property.      &amp;#x200B;    I am now at a total loss after having upheld all of my tenant obligations only to be left to freeze during the winter and burn alive during the summer.       &amp;#x200B;    I am looking for an advocacy group or a lawyer that wont rake me over the coals. I want to break my lease on the grounds that they are not completing repairs in a timely manner. I want the money back that they owe me for all the rent I have paid while they let me suffer. Please, if you know anything or anyone who can help me, reply with their information.      &amp;#x200B;    TL:DR Heating and air has not worked since 11/17/2021 and company has zero intention of fixing it. Need lawyer or legal assistance. Don't rent from Mainstreet Renewal.
__label__0 My bf and I have been together for almost 8 yrs. He’s lived with my family and I for about a year and 8 months now, and is planning to move out in the next two weeks back to his moms place. It’s just more convenient for things like work, checking on her health, and gives him more time to do things he enjoys.     When he mentioned that he was thinking about this move, he asked if taking time off between us would be a possibility because he doesn’t want to drag me down emotionally. He gets very depressed and there are many things going against him currently, and I always try to be his biggest supporter and cheerleader but he still pushes me away. And ever since then I feel like I have been distraught. I can’t stop crying, picking stupid fights, acting out on my emotions because it feels like not only will I lose him in proximity, it’s like I’m losing him all together. It’s terrifying. He’s my best friend, he’s my home, and I care and love him so much. A part of me agrees that we should take the break, and I mentioned this too. I regret saying it, because I think it’s inevitable. And I feel like I’m already mourning losing him when I still have some time left and I don’t know how to control this.       My impulsive behavior is not matching what my heart is aching to hold onto dearly and it’s really hard to just let him go.  But if I do, if we take this break, I hope he eventually transforms into the person he wants to be, and we find each other again.     First love hurts so traumatically, and I really wanted us to be that couple that made it out of it stronger. But right now it feels like it’s engraving into its own headstone, and all I can do is watch my hands uncontrollably use the tools to do so.

__label__1 I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for all the wonderful cards and postcards I've received recently! Each one has brought a smile to my face and brightened my day in ways I can't even describe.     First off, a huge thank you to u/whimsicalwriter for the beautiful watercolor postcard of a sunset over the ocean. The colors are so vibrant, and it instantly transported me to a peaceful beach setting. Your note about your recent trip to the coast was delightful to read, and I appreciate you sharing your experiences with me!    Next, u/creativecardmaker, your handmade card was simply stunning! The intricate details and the way you incorporated different textures made it feel so special. I loved the little message you included about your favorite crafting supplies. It’s always inspiring to hear about what others enjoy using in their creative processes.    A big shoutout to u/naturelover123 for the postcard featuring a breathtaking mountain landscape. I could almost feel the fresh air and hear the rustling leaves as I looked at it. Your description of hiking in that area made me want to pack my bags and hit the trails right away!    u/sentimentalpostcards, thank you for the vintage postcard! I adore the retro vibe, and it’s fascinating to think about the history behind it. Your thoughts on how postcards have changed over the years were so interesting, and I couldn’t agree more!    Lastly, u/sweetstamps, your card with the adorable animal illustrations was such a treat! I loved the little stickers you added, and your note about your pet made me smile. It’s always nice to connect over our furry friends!    Thank you all once again for your kindness and creativity. I’m working on some cards to send out soon, and I hope to spread the joy you’ve all given me. Keep being awesome!
__label__1 It's hard to put into words how disappointed I am with the Rockets' performance this season. After all the hype and promise from the offseason, I really thought we were going to see a significant leap forward. Instead, it feels like we're stuck in the same cycle of inconsistency and missed opportunities.    The young talent is there, but it seems like they’re struggling to find their rhythm. The turnovers are killing us, and the defense has been lackluster at best. I keep hoping for that breakout game where everything clicks, but it just hasn’t happened yet.     I know it’s a rebuilding year, and patience is key, but as a fan, it’s tough to watch. I just want to see some progress and a glimpse of what this team can become. Here’s hoping for a turnaround soon, because right now, it’s hard to stay optimistic.
__label__0 I simply don't have the money, space or time to make use of an actual console, never had. Stadia was perfect for me, only playing FIFA, since I've never had a console or a gaming PC. Are there any alternatives once Stadia goes dark? GFN, Xcloud, Luna etc don't have FIFA, is there any possibility one of these will pick up FIFA 22/23 in the future? Cloud gaming is just so easy, I love being able to open up FIFA on my phone and load up onto the TV in seconds.

__label__1 With the season approaching, I've been thinking a lot about Julio Jones and his potential impact on fantasy rosters this year. After a couple of injury-plagued seasons, I’m curious if he can bounce back and be a reliable WR option again.     He’s now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which is a high-powered offense, but he’s also joining a crowded receiving corps with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Do you think he can carve out a significant role, or is he more of a late-round flyer at this point?     Also, how do you feel about his injury history? Is it too risky to invest in him, or do you think he has enough upside to be worth the gamble? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__0 We broke up 4 months ago because she said she wasn’t in the mindset to commit because of her mental health issues and I didn’y want to have an only sexual relationship. Then, we started texting again. We texted everyday for 2 months and met a few days ago. We didn’t kiss, nothing sexual/romantic happened but we talked for hours. She said it was so nice to see me and that she wanted to keep meeting. But I don’t know what her intention is… Is this a friendly thing? Does she want to keep dating me etc… and no idea how to solve it and communicate.     Another point is that the whole time she talked about how she fixed her depression. And I saw her on a dating app looking for long term dating. She knows I liked her at that time. So I guess she would have communicated if she had wanted something? Or maybe she wants to do it slowly???
__label__1 In Season 6, Episode 1 of The Sopranos, titled "Members Only," we see a flashback to 1986 where Tony Soprano and Tony Blundetto (Tony B) are involved in a scheme to hijack Betamax tapes. This scene is significant for a few reasons.     Firstly, it highlights the changing landscape of the entertainment industry during the 1980s. Betamax was a popular format for home video recording and playback, and at the time, it was a hot commodity. The hijacking of these tapes reflects the mob's involvement in various illegal activities, including the theft of consumer goods that were in high demand.     Secondly, this flashback serves to deepen the character development of Tony B. It shows his willingness to engage in criminal activities alongside Tony, establishing their bond and the shared history that would later complicate their relationship. The scene also foreshadows the eventual fallout between the two characters, as Tony B's criminal choices lead him down a darker path.     Lastly, the choice of Betamax specifically is interesting because it represents a technology that ultimately lost out to VHS, paralleling the themes of ambition and failure that run throughout the series. Just like the Betamax, some of the characters' choices lead to their downfall.     Overall, the hijacking of Betamax tapes is a clever narrative device that encapsulates the era, the characters' dynamics, and the overarching themes of The Sopranos.

__label__1 I've been experiencing some pretty severe reactions lately, and I'm trying to figure out what food might be causing my allergies. It started a few months ago with some mild itching and hives, but recently I've had more intense symptoms like stomach cramps, nausea, and even some swelling in my face and throat after eating.     I've been keeping a food diary to track what I eat and when the reactions occur, but it's been tough to pinpoint the exact trigger. I usually eat a pretty varied diet, but I suspect it might be something common like nuts, dairy, or gluten.     Has anyone else gone through this process? What steps did you take to identify your food allergies? Did you do any specific tests or elimination diets? I’m really hoping to get to the bottom of this before it gets worse. Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I recently attempted to stain a wooden table, but things didn’t go as planned. I used a dark walnut stain, and after applying it, I realized that I didn’t wipe off the excess quickly enough. Now, the surface is blotchy and uneven, and I’m worried that I’ve ruined the table.     Is there any way to salvage this situation? I’ve heard that sanding it down might help, but I’m not sure how much I should sand or if I should try to apply another coat of stain to even it out.     Any tips or advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I recently booted up Borderlands 3 on my Xbox Series X and noticed that the game is labeled as "Xbox One X Enhanced." I was under the impression that the Series X would automatically provide the best possible performance for all games, especially those that are enhanced for the previous generation.     However, I found it a bit confusing because while the game does look great and runs smoothly, I can't help but wonder if I'm missing out on any specific enhancements that might be available for Series X.     Is there anyone else who has experienced this? Are there any settings or options I should be aware of to ensure I'm getting the most out of Borderlands 3 on my Series X? I’ve heard some games have specific optimizations for the Series X that go beyond what was available on the One X, but I’m not sure if Borderlands 3 is one of them.     Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

__label__1 I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but the emote music in Save the World seems to be completely broken lately! I was playing with some friends, and every time someone used an emote, the music would either not play at all or would cut out halfway through. It’s super frustrating because we love to vibe while taking down husks, and the music really adds to the fun atmosphere.    Has anyone else experienced this? Is it just a glitch, or is it something that’s been happening for a while? I hope they fix it soon because it really takes away from the experience when you can’t enjoy the emote tunes. Let’s share our thoughts and maybe some workarounds if you’ve found any!      Also, what are your favorite emotes to use while playing? I need some new ones to try out once this gets sorted!

__label__1 I’m looking for some clarity on a situation that has been bothering me. I live in California, and I recently had a conversation with a friend about consent and substance use. We were discussing whether consuming marijuana (even just one hit) could invalidate consent in a sexual situation.    To provide some context, my friend believes that if someone is under the influence of any substance, including marijuana, they cannot give valid consent. I understand that consent must be clear and enthusiastic, but I’m unsure how the law views this in relation to marijuana use.     Is there a legal standard in California regarding consent and substance use? If someone takes a hit of weed, does that automatically mean they cannot consent to sexual activity? What if they are still coherent and able to communicate their desires clearly?     I want to make sure I understand the legal implications and ensure that everyone involved in any situation is protected and respected. Any insights or references to legal statutes would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I have completed the game several times and have earned all steam achievements. I still don't feel like I have really won since I have done all of it using spirit ashes. What build/ weapon type would help me beat the game with no summons? I wouldn't ask, but I am older and used the falling star beast jaw and a +10 mimic tear and +10 Tiche  or mage build with same summons so far which was easy even for a 62 year old with no reaction time to speak of. I'm guessing some sort of bleed setup. Any suggestion would be appreciated.
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m currently preparing for my Biology I Honors End of Course Exam, and I could really use some study suggestions. I want to make sure I cover all the important topics and do well on the exam.     Here’s what I’ve been doing so far:  - Reviewing my class notes and textbook chapters.  - Watching YouTube videos for visual explanations of complex topics.  - Using flashcards for key terms and concepts.    But I feel like I could be doing more.     What study methods have worked for you? Are there any specific resources, like websites or study guides, that you found particularly helpful? Also, how do you recommend managing my time effectively as the exam date approaches?     Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate it!
__label__0 I was only ever a plot device.
__label__1 I was playing a run with my friends last night, and we noticed something interesting with the Out With A Bang card. It seems like the explosive damage from the card was stacking in a way we hadn't seen before.     We had a couple of players using it, and when we triggered the explosions, the damage output was significantly higher than expected. It felt like each explosion was amplifying the next one, almost like they were compounding.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a bug, or is there something in the mechanics that allows for this kind of stacking? I know the card is supposed to give you a bang for your buck, but this felt like a whole new level! Would love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has more info on this!
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I'm currently an architect and, to be honest, I'm feeling quite disillusioned with the industry. I’m conducting a quick survey to gather insights on how people perceive the architecture field and what changes they would like to see. This will help me understand if there are alternative paths I could consider or if there are common frustrations that we can address as a community.    The survey is super short—only about 2 minutes of your time. I would really appreciate your honest feedback, whether you’re in the industry or just have thoughts about it.     Here’s the link to the survey: [https://forms.gle/examplelink](https://forms.gle/examplelink)      Thank you so much for your help! Your input means a lot to me as I navigate this challenging time.     Best,    A fellow architect
__label__1 I've been debating whether to spend my stones on the Ginyu Force banner, especially since I don't have Recoome or Guldo yet. I know Ginyu is a solid unit, but without the other two, will he still be effective in my team?     I've heard that the Ginyu Force units work really well together, and having Ginyu could help me in events where synergy is key. But I'm also worried about missing out on other banners that might have better units for my overall team composition.     What do you all think? Is it worth it to go for Ginyu, or should I save my stones for a future banner? Any advice would be appreciated!

Are my headphones defective?    Should I do a warranty claim?    I also found out these are discontinued, so how will they send me a replacement? I don't want a refurbished headphone.    If anyone can anyone help me answer these questions I would really appreciate it.    Thank you
__label__0 So I've graduated high-school and really hoped I could go out with this one girl. It didn't end up happening. Now I've basically been cut off from all girls, and friends for that matter.

__label__1 I’m just a few weeks post-op from my gastric sleeve surgery, and I’ve been trying to figure out my caffeine intake. I’ve read mixed opinions on whether caffeine is okay after surgery, especially since it can be dehydrating and might irritate the stomach.     I came across a recommendation that 22mg of caffeine is generally considered a low amount. For reference, that’s about the amount in a small cup of green tea. I’m curious if anyone else has had experience with this amount of caffeine post-op. Did you find it affected your recovery or hydration levels?     I want to be cautious and make sure I’m not doing anything that could hinder my healing process, but I also miss my morning routine of having a warm drink. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been reading a lot about sun protection lately, and I keep coming across the advice that we should wear sunscreen even when we're indoors. I wanted to get the community's thoughts on this.     I understand that UV rays can penetrate windows, especially UVA rays, which are linked to skin aging and some types of skin cancer. However, I often find myself indoors for most of the day, and I’m not sure if applying sunscreen is necessary in that case.     For those of you who wear sunscreen indoors, do you have a specific product you prefer? Do you think it makes a noticeable difference in your skin's health? Also, how do you incorporate it into your routine if you’re already using other skincare products?     I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips you might have!
__label__1 Navigating a relationship with someone who has experienced significant loss can be challenging, especially when there are children involved. Here are some thoughts on how to approach this situation:    1. **Be Understanding and Patient**: Recognize that she has gone through a traumatic experience with the loss of her partner. It’s important to be patient and understanding as she may still be processing her grief. Allow her to share her feelings at her own pace.    2. **Listen Actively**: When she talks about her experiences, listen without judgment. Show empathy and validate her feelings. Sometimes, just being there to listen can mean a lot.    3. **Respect Her Boundaries**: She may have certain boundaries when it comes to discussing her past or her daughter’s father. Be respectful of those boundaries and don’t push her to share more than she’s comfortable with.    4. **Be Supportive**: Offer your support in practical ways. This could mean helping her with her child, offering to babysit, or simply being there for her when she needs someone to talk to.     5. **Communicate Openly**: As your relationship develops, communicate openly about your feelings and intentions. It’s important to be clear about what you want from the relationship while also being sensitive to her situation.    6. **Take Things Slow**: Given her circumstances, it might be best to take things slow. Building trust and a strong foundation is crucial, especially when children are involved.    7. **Be Prepared for Challenges**: Understand that there may be challenges ahead, especially if she is still grieving. Be prepared to navigate those challenges together and be supportive.    8. **Encourage Self-Care**: Encourage her to take time for herself, whether that’s through hobbies, self-care routines, or spending time with friends. It’s important for her to have a support system outside of your relationship as well.    9. **Consider the Child’s Needs**: If your relationship progresses, think about how you can be a positive influence in her daughter’s life. Building a relationship with the child will take time and should be approached with care.    10. **Seek Guidance if Needed**: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or unsure about how to proceed, consider seeking advice from friends, family, or even a professional who can provide guidance on relationships involving loss and parenting.    Ultimately, the key is to approach the situation with compassion and understanding. Building a relationship with someone who has experienced loss requires sensitivity, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the concept of neurological sex and how it relates to our understanding of gender identity. It seems like a lot of people still cling to the idea that gender is strictly binary and tied to biological sex, but the more I read about neurological differences, the more I realize how complex this topic really is.    For instance, studies have shown that there are differences in brain structure and function between cisgender men and women, but those differences don't always align with someone's gender identity. This makes me wonder how much of our understanding of gender is influenced by societal norms versus biological factors.     As a transgender person, I often feel like my identity is questioned or invalidated because I don't fit neatly into the binary categories that many people are comfortable with. It can be frustrating to explain that my experience of gender is deeply rooted in my sense of self, which doesn't always correlate with the physical aspects of my body or the traditional definitions of male and female.    I think it's important for us to have open discussions about neurological sex and how it intersects with gender identity. Understanding that our brains might not conform to societal expectations can help us create a more inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of where they fall on the gender spectrum.     What are your thoughts on this? Have you experienced any challenges related to how others perceive your gender based on their understanding of biological or neurological differences?
__label__1 I've been looking into getting a new printer, but I'm really tired of the constant battle with overpriced ink cartridges. It seems like every time I need to replace them, the cost is almost as much as the printer itself! Are there any brands or models that are known for having more reasonably priced ink or even options for refillable tanks? I just want to print without feeling like I'm being ripped off every time I need to buy ink.
__label__1 I have a 7-year-old Labrador mix who has always been a gentle and friendly dog. Recently, I've noticed a change in her behavior regarding food. She has started to show signs of possessiveness, especially when she’s eating or if I try to take away her bowl after she’s finished. She growls and even snaps if I get too close.    This behavior is new and quite concerning for me. I’ve always been able to take her food away without any issues, and she’s never shown any aggression before. I’m not sure what could have triggered this change.     I’ve read that food possessiveness can sometimes stem from insecurity or fear, but I’m not sure how to address it. I want to ensure she feels safe and secure, but I also need to manage this behavior for the safety of everyone in the household.    Has anyone else experienced this with their dogs? What steps can I take to help her feel more comfortable and reduce this possessiveness? Any training tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey Boston!     I’m reaching out in hopes of reconnecting with a girl I was talking to a little while back. We had some great conversations and I really enjoyed getting to know you. I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I remember you mentioned you were into hiking and trying out new coffee shops around the city.     We lost contact, and I’ve been thinking about you lately. If you see this, I’d love to hear from you again! Maybe we can grab a coffee or go for a hike like we talked about?     Hope to hear from you soon!

__label__1 I've been following CRO for a while now, and I've noticed that its price action has been incredibly choppy lately. It seems like every time I try to make a trade, the price swings wildly, making it hard to execute a strategy.     Is this volatility due to low trading volume, or are there other factors at play? I've heard some people mention that the market sentiment around crypto is affecting CRO specifically, especially with the recent news about regulatory changes and market trends.     Additionally, I've seen some discussions about the liquidity on certain exchanges where CRO is traded. Could that be contributing to the erratic price movements?     I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences with trading CRO. Are you finding it just as difficult, or have you found ways to navigate this choppy market? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hello fellow tea enthusiasts! 🌱    I’ve been on a quest to explore unique and rare teas, and I’d love to hear about your experiences! What is the rarest tea you’ve ever tried?     For me, it was a limited edition Da Hong Pao (Big Red Robe) that I stumbled upon at a small tea shop during a trip to China. The flavor was incredibly complex, with deep roasted notes and a hint of sweetness that lingered on the palate. I’ve never tasted anything quite like it since!     I’m curious to know if anyone else has had the chance to try something truly special or rare. What made it stand out for you? Any recommendations for where to find these elusive brews? Let’s share our tea adventures!

__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’m currently in a bit of a unique situation and I’m hoping to get some advice from those who might be in a similar boat. My fixed mortgage deal is set to finish in about 8 months, and I’m planning to move at that time.     I’ve been looking into the housing market and trying to gauge whether it’s a good time to buy or if I should consider renting for a while. I’m particularly concerned about the potential interest rate changes and how they might affect my mortgage options when I do decide to buy.     Additionally, I’m trying to figure out the best way to prepare financially for this move. Should I start saving more aggressively now, or do you think it’s better to wait until I have a clearer picture of the market?     If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any tips on how to navigate this transition, I would really appreciate your insights.     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 As a therapist, I often hear about the emotional toll that working with clients can take on mental health professionals. I’m curious to know if any therapists or mental health practitioners have ever felt like they’ve absorbed or contracted a mental illness from a patient.     For example, have you ever found yourself feeling unusually anxious, depressed, or stressed after working with a client who was dealing with similar issues? How do you manage those feelings, and what strategies do you use to maintain your own mental health while supporting others?     I think it’s important to discuss the impact of this work on therapists, as it can be a challenging field. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey guys, I noticed that the meta has shifted quite a bit since the last patch, and I wanted to share my thoughts on some of the changes.     First off, it seems like the popularity of certain traits has skyrocketed, especially with the introduction of the new champions. I’ve been seeing a lot of players gravitating towards the Mystic trait for that extra magic resistance, which is a game-changer against all the AP-heavy comps that are running rampant right now.     On the flip side, I feel like some of the older traits are being overlooked. For instance, I’ve been experimenting with a Blademaster comp, and while it’s not as flashy as some of the newer traits, it can still pack a punch if you get the right items. I think there’s a lot of potential for players to rediscover these underappreciated traits and catch their opponents off guard.    Also, I’ve been trying to figure out the best way to manage my economy with the current state of the game. With the changes to interest and the way gold generation works, I find myself either over-saving or spending too much too quickly. How are you all handling your gold management? Any tips or strategies that have been working for you?    I’d love to hear your thoughts on the current meta and any strategies you’ve been enjoying lately!

__label__0 Hello, I earn about $300 extra a month online in a separate account.  I struggle very hard with money management, when I have it I want to spend it, and this has lead to some moderate credit card debt (about $6,500 CAD)    My bills and monthly expenses are covered by my day job-however I am unsure what is the best plan for my extra income.    I have two ideas, both with pros and cons.    Idea 1: Leave money in online account where it cannot be used for payments until I have earned a good chunk of change, around $3,000 and chunk my debt with that.  Pros: No chance I waste money  Cons: I struggle with monthly credit payments as is, and might not get anywhere in the meantime    Idea 2:  Pull money out once a month ($300) and automatically apply it to my credit card debt.  Pros: Pays off more consistently, banks like that.  Cons: High chance I waste this extra money.    Open to all suggestions but I just wanted to let everyone know what I was already thinking!
__label__1 I just got demoted to SILVER and I’m honestly so frustrated right now. I was playing a match and my teammates were just not cooperating at all. I had a couple of guys who were clearly throwing, and others who just didn’t seem to care about the game. I tried to communicate and strategize, but it felt like I was talking to a wall.     I know that matchmaking can be hit or miss, but it’s so disheartening to put in the effort and still end up losing because of teammates who don’t take the game seriously. I’ve been working hard to improve my skills and climb the ranks, and now I feel like I’m back at square one.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with the frustration of getting demoted due to teammates? Any tips on how to stay motivated and keep pushing through? I just want to get back to where I was!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I'm currently in my clinical rotations and I've been assigned to OB/GYN, focusing mainly on obstetrics. I find the subject fascinating but also quite challenging, especially with the amount of information we need to retain and the clinical skills we need to master.    I was wondering if anyone has any tips or resources that have helped them study effectively for this rotation. Specifically, I'm looking for:    1. **Key topics to focus on**: What are the most important concepts or conditions in obstetrics that I should prioritize in my studies?  2. **Study resources**: Are there any textbooks, online courses, or videos that you found particularly helpful?  3. **Clinical skills**: What are the essential hands-on skills I should practice, and how can I best prepare for them?  4. **Exam preparation**: Any advice on how to prepare for the shelf exam or any specific types of questions I should expect?    Thanks in advance for your help! I really want to make the most of this rotation and ensure I have a solid understanding of obstetrics.
__label__1 If I were a woman for a day or a week, I think I would approach the experience with a mix of curiosity and empathy. Here are a few things I would do:    1. **Experience Daily Life**: I would go about a typical day as a woman, from getting ready in the morning to navigating work or school. I’d pay attention to the little things, like how I dress, the products I use, and how I feel in public spaces.    2. **Social Interactions**: I’d observe how people interact with me differently compared to how they do now. I’d be interested in whether I receive different treatment in social settings, at work, or even just in casual encounters. It would be enlightening to see how gender dynamics play out in real-time.    3. **Fashion and Beauty**: I’d explore the world of fashion and beauty, perhaps trying out different styles and makeup. I’d want to understand the societal pressures women face regarding appearance and how that affects their confidence and self-image.    4. **Conversations with Other Women**: I’d take the opportunity to have deeper conversations with women in my life about their experiences, challenges, and triumphs. I think it would be valuable to hear their perspectives on issues like body image, career advancement, and relationships.    5. **Safety and Comfort**: I’d be particularly aware of my surroundings and how safe I feel in different environments. I’d want to understand the nuances of being a woman in public spaces, including the precautions many women take that I might not think about as a man.    6. **Self-Care and Mental Health**: I’d explore self-care routines that women often engage in, whether it’s through exercise, meditation, or socializing. I’d want to see how these practices impact mental health and overall well-being.    7. **Advocacy and Activism**: I’d take some time to learn about the issues women face globally, from reproductive rights to workplace equality. I’d want to understand how I could contribute to advocacy efforts and support women’s rights.    Overall, I think this experience would be eye-opening and would help me appreciate the complexities of being a woman in today’s society. It would also give me a better understanding of how to be a more supportive ally.

__label__1 I'm looking for some inspiration for a crochet gift! I have a few friends' birthdays coming up, and I want to make something special for each of them. One friend loves cats, another is really into plants, and the last one is a big fan of cozy blankets.     I was thinking about making a cute cat toy for my cat-loving friend, maybe a little amigurumi cat or a catnip-filled mouse. For the plant enthusiast, I thought about crocheting a plant pot cover or a cute succulent. And for my friend who loves blankets, I could make a lap blanket or a throw in their favorite colors.     What do you all think? Any other ideas or patterns you would recommend? I want to make sure each gift feels personal and thoughtful!

__label__1 I live in a small town where everyone knows each other, and for the most part, it feels safe. But there’s one experience that still sends chills down my spine, and it happened a few years ago.    It was a chilly autumn evening, and I was home alone. My parents had gone out for dinner, and I was left to my own devices. I decided to make myself some tea, so I filled the kettle with water and set it on the stove. As I waited for it to boil, I settled down on the couch with a book, the warm glow of the lamp casting a cozy light around the room.    After a few minutes, I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen. It sounded like the kettle was rattling, but I thought nothing of it at first. I figured it was just the steam building up. However, the noise continued, and it started to sound more like a tapping. I got up to check it out, thinking maybe the kettle was just on an uneven surface.    As I approached the kitchen, I noticed that the kettle was indeed boiling, but the tapping noise was still there. I looked around, and that’s when I saw it. A shadowy figure standing just outside the kitchen window, peering in. My heart dropped. I froze, unsure of what to do. The figure was tall and thin, and I could barely make out any features in the dim light.    I quickly ducked behind the wall, my heart racing. I could hear the figure moving, and I realized it was trying to get a better look inside. I grabbed my phone, but my hands were shaking so badly that I could barely dial 911. I managed to hit the call button, but I didn’t want to make any noise that would alert the figure.    I stayed crouched behind the wall, listening as the figure began to knock on the window. It was a slow, deliberate tapping, and I could feel the panic rising in my chest. I wanted to scream, but I knew that would only draw attention to me. After what felt like an eternity, the figure finally turned and walked away, disappearing into the darkness.    I waited a few more minutes, my heart still pounding, before I finally mustered the courage to peek out the window. I didn’t see anyone, but I could feel the weight of the moment pressing down on me. I called my parents, and they rushed home, but by the time they arrived, there was no sign of anyone outside.    The police were called, and they did a sweep of the area, but they found nothing. They told me it was probably just a prank, but I knew it felt too real for that. To this day, I still wonder who that person was and what they wanted. I never felt safe in my home again, and I always double-check the locks on my doors and windows.     So, to the figure who stood outside my kitchen window that night, let’s not meet again.

__label__1 Hey everyone!    I’m looking to build a gaming PC for my son and I, and this will be our first time doing it. We want something that can handle modern games at decent settings, and I’d love to get your advice on our build. Here’s what I have in mind so far:    **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor    **CPU Cooler:** Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB    **Motherboard:** MSI B550-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard    **Memory:** Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16    **Storage:** Crucial P3 1 TB M.2 NVMe SSD    **Video Card:** MSI GeForce GTX 1660 Super 6 GB VENTUS XS OC    **Case:** NZXT H510 ATX Mid Tower Case    **Power Supply:** EVGA 600 W1 80+ WHITE 600W      **Total Estimated Cost:** Around $1,000      ### What We Plan to Use It For:  - Gaming (mostly titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, and some AAA games)    - Light video editing and streaming      ### Questions:  1. **Is the GPU sufficient for 1080p gaming?** I’ve read that the GTX 1660 Super is a solid choice for 1080p, but I’m open to suggestions if there’s a better option within a similar price range.  2. **Is the power supply adequate?** I want to ensure we have enough wattage and reliability for future upgrades.  3. **Are there any compatibility issues I should be aware of?** I’ve tried to double-check everything, but I’m a bit nervous about making sure all the parts work together.  4. **Any recommendations for improving the build?** If there are any parts that you think I should swap out for better performance or value, please let me know!    Thanks in advance for your help! I’m really excited to get started on this project with my son!

__label__1 I came across a heartwarming story that really got me thinking about the way we attribute life-saving events to divine intervention rather than human action. A young boy reportedly saved his grandfather from choking by performing the Heimlich maneuver, and the family was quick to credit this miraculous event to their "sky daddy"—essentially attributing the boy's quick thinking and learned skills to a higher power.    While I can appreciate the sentiment of gratitude, it frustrates me that we often overlook the importance of education, training, and the boy's own instincts in such situations. The Heimlich maneuver is a learned skill, and the boy's ability to save his grandfather was a direct result of knowledge and practice, not divine intervention.     This kind of narrative perpetuates the idea that we should rely on faith rather than our own abilities and the resources available to us. It diminishes the value of human agency and the importance of teaching life-saving skills.     I wonder how many other stories like this exist where human effort is overshadowed by the need to attribute outcomes to a deity. It’s a reminder of how deeply ingrained these beliefs are in our culture, and how they can sometimes lead us to ignore the real heroes in our lives.
__label__0 [https://imgur.com/a/wTcUDUA](https://imgur.com/a/wTcUDUA)    I’ve been wearing 36 C and D in my recent years but the bras never fit properly, as I felt that my breasts sit too wide on my chest, looked too pointy or padded too much for my size. I shelled out for an expensive bra at a well-known lingerie store in Brooklyn. I’m not sure I feel right in it because to me it feels and looks like I’m not wearing a bra but looks slightly perkier than without me wearing one. I’m really struggling with what a bra is supposed to look like on my size and frame because I’ve been wearing sports bras for so long that just smash them down but doesn’t look flattering on a tighter shirt. Any feedback would be helpful. Thank you!
__label__1 🚀🚀🚀 Alright fellow degenerates, it’s time to put our money where our memes are! Introducing WSB’s first fund: REET 1k! 💰💰    Here’s the deal: we’re pooling our resources to invest in some of the hottest REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) out there. Why? Because while we’re all about those YOLO options, we also need to diversify our portfolios and make some steady gains.     The plan is simple: each of us throws in $1,000, and we’ll collectively decide on which REITs to invest in. Think about it – we can ride the wave of the real estate market while still having the thrill of being part of the WSB community.     Imagine the gains when we hit that sweet spot of rental income and property appreciation! 🏠💸 Plus, we can meme our way through the ups and downs of the market.     Let’s brainstorm some potential REITs to invest in! I’m thinking about some solid options like $O (Realty Income), $VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF), or even some niche ones like $SPG (Simon Property Group) for those mall vibes.     So, who’s in? Let’s make REET 1k the next big thing and show Wall Street that we can play the long game too! 💪🔥     Remember, this is all for fun and educational purposes – do your own research and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose! Let’s get this bread! 🍞🚀
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’ve been on my NoFap journey for a while now, and I’ve been reflecting on what it truly means to be successful in this lifestyle. A question that keeps coming to my mind is: does being a successful NoFapp-er mean being celibate your whole life?    From my perspective, NoFap is about breaking free from the chains of compulsive behaviors related to pornography and masturbation. It’s about reclaiming control over our minds and bodies, improving our mental health, and fostering healthier relationships. For many of us, the ultimate goal is not necessarily celibacy but rather achieving a balanced and fulfilling life where we can enjoy intimacy without the negative impacts of PMO.    I believe that success in NoFap can look different for everyone. For some, it might mean complete abstinence from sexual activities for a certain period, while for others, it could mean learning to engage in healthy sexual relationships without the influence of pornography. The key is to understand our motivations and what we want to achieve through this journey.    I’ve noticed that as I progress, my views on intimacy and relationships have evolved. I’m starting to appreciate the emotional and physical connections that come with healthy relationships rather than just seeking instant gratification. This shift has made me realize that I don’t have to be celibate to be successful in NoFap; instead, I can focus on building meaningful connections and being present in those moments.    What do you all think? Does being a successful NoFapp-er mean being celibate for life, or can we find a balance that allows for healthy relationships? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic.     Stay strong, everyone!
__label__0 I (31F) live with my grandfather (88M). He is constantly cold so the thermostat is usually set at 75F (about 24C). Well that's fine in summer when its cool air being circulated though the house from the ac and wearing summer appropriate clothes but winter is coming and now the temp is 77F (25C). I hate the heat and prefer it to be cooler in the house especially at night because I can't sleep well when I'm hot. My room is the closest to the furnace, it is literally right outside my bedroom door just one floor down in the basement, and the thermostat and its sensor are right outside my room since that's the middle of the house. I am currently stuck at that stage where you feel gross and will start sweating soon and there is only a flat sheet on my bed.     So I'm looking for ideas on how to drastically (at least a few degrees) cool my room this winter without touching or messing with the sensor outside my room. I have a box fan but that will only move the warm air. I can only take off so much before becoming indecent.  Anybody got any ideas?
__label__1 Man, those were some wild times! I thought I was the funniest kid ever with that line. I remember the reactions were all over the place—some girls would laugh, some would just be confused, and a few would even get mad. I guess I was just trying to be clever and make friends, but looking back, I can’t believe I thought that was a good idea!     It’s funny how cringy our past selves can be. I wonder if anyone else has similar stories from when they were younger. What were some of your most embarrassing or cringy moments trying to make friends? I feel like we all have those awkward phases that we look back on and just cringe hard. 😂
__label__1 Vivienne has always been a polarizing character in Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I find myself on the side of those who struggle to appreciate her. Here are a few reasons why I can't bring myself to like her:    1. **Elitism and Arrogance**: From the moment you meet her, Vivienne exudes an air of superiority. Her constant references to her noble status and her disdain for those she considers beneath her can be off-putting. It feels like she looks down on the Inquisition and its members, which makes it hard to connect with her.    2. **Manipulative Nature**: Vivienne is a master manipulator, and while I can appreciate a character with depth, her willingness to play political games often feels disingenuous. She seems more interested in advancing her own agenda than genuinely helping the Inquisition or its cause.    3. **Conflicting Values**: As a mage, I expected her to be more sympathetic to the struggles of her fellow mages, especially given the context of the Mage-Templar conflict. Instead, she often aligns herself with the status quo, which can feel like a betrayal to those who see her as a potential ally for mages everywhere.    4. **Lack of Depth**: While some characters in DAI have rich backstories and complex motivations, I find Vivienne's character to be somewhat one-dimensional. Her obsession with power and status overshadows any potential for growth or redemption, making her feel more like a caricature than a fully realized character.    5. **Romantic Options**: I know some players enjoy her as a romance option, but I personally find it hard to see past her flaws. The idea of pursuing a relationship with someone who embodies so much elitism and manipulation feels unappealing to me.    In conclusion, while I understand that Vivienne has her fans, her personality traits and motivations make it difficult for me to appreciate her character. I prefer characters who show more empathy and complexity, and unfortunately, Vivienne just doesn't fit that mold for me.

__label__1 When it comes to dating and finding a girlfriend, I think many men do consider the balance between attractiveness and the maintenance involved in a relationship. Attractiveness is often the initial draw; physical appearance can spark interest and chemistry. However, as we get to know someone, other factors come into play that can either enhance or detract from that initial attraction.    Maintenance can refer to emotional investment, communication styles, and the effort required to keep the relationship healthy and fulfilling. For instance, a woman might be incredibly attractive, but if she has a very demanding personality or if our values don’t align, it can lead to a lot of stress and conflict. On the other hand, someone who may not fit the conventional standards of beauty but shares similar interests, values, and has a compatible personality can often lead to a more rewarding and less maintenance-heavy relationship.    Ultimately, I think it’s about finding a balance that works for you personally. Some guys might prioritize looks more heavily, while others might lean towards emotional compatibility and shared values. It’s a personal choice, and I believe that as we mature, many of us start to value the deeper aspects of a relationship over just physical attraction.

It sounds really hard to keep them alive and healthy. And the egg process from the stores seen so much better still. Am I looking at this all wrong?

__label__1 Social media has undeniably transformed the way we communicate, share information, and connect with others. On one hand, it has brought about significant benefits: it allows people to stay in touch with friends and family across the globe, provides a platform for marginalized voices, and facilitates the rapid spread of information, which can be crucial during emergencies or social movements.    However, there are also substantial downsides. The rise of misinformation, cyberbullying, and the impact on mental health, particularly among younger users, cannot be overlooked. Social media can create echo chambers, where individuals are only exposed to viewpoints that reinforce their own, leading to increased polarization in society.    In my opinion, the overall impact of social media is a mixed bag. It has the potential for both good and harm, and its effects largely depend on how individuals and society choose to engage with it. What do you all think? Has social media been more beneficial or detrimental to our society?
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m on the hunt for a good gaming headset for my PS5 and I’m looking to spend around $150. I’m located in the USA and would love to hear your recommendations!      I primarily play FPS games like Call of Duty and Apex Legends, so I’m looking for something with great sound quality and a good microphone for in-game communication. Wireless would be a plus, but I’m open to wired options as well.      If you have any suggestions or personal experiences with headsets in this price range, please share! Thanks in advance!

Also if there are any local websites that are popular?
__label__1 Time travel is a fascinating concept that has captivated writers and audiences alike for decades. However, it often comes with a hefty dose of scrutiny. As a writer, I believe that time travel can indeed be written well, but it requires careful consideration of several key elements to avoid common pitfalls.    One of the main criticisms of time travel narratives is the potential for plot holes and inconsistencies. When characters jump through time, the rules of the universe can become convoluted, leading to confusion for the reader. To combat this, a writer must establish clear rules for how time travel works in their story. For example, does changing the past create a new timeline, or does it alter the existing one? By setting these parameters early on, writers can create a more cohesive and believable narrative.    Another challenge is the risk of overcomplicating the plot. Time travel stories can easily become tangled in their own mechanics, making it difficult for readers to follow the storyline. A successful time travel narrative often focuses on character development and emotional stakes rather than just the mechanics of time travel itself. By grounding the story in relatable human experiences, writers can create a more engaging and impactful narrative.    Additionally, time travel can serve as a powerful metaphor for themes such as regret, redemption, and the consequences of our choices. When used thoughtfully, it can elevate a story beyond mere science fiction and resonate with readers on a deeper level.    In conclusion, while time travel does come with its fair share of challenges and criticisms, it can be written well if approached with care and creativity. What are your thoughts? Have you read any time travel stories that you felt handled the concept particularly well or poorly? Let's discuss!
__label__0 It was a fighting game and was in the style of tekken 1 and 2 but it was not tekken, that much i remember.
__label__1 I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about two years now, and while I love him deeply, I can't shake this feeling of paranoia that creeps in from time to time. It often manifests as an overwhelming fear that he might be cheating on me or that he doesn't love me as much as I love him.     I know that he cares for me, and he has never given me any reason to doubt his loyalty. He’s always been open and communicative, but I still find myself going down this rabbit hole of negative thoughts. I often check his social media, and I feel anxious when he doesn't respond to texts right away.     I’ve tried to talk to him about my feelings, but I worry that I might be pushing him away or making him feel suffocated. I don’t want to be that girlfriend who constantly questions her partner, but I can’t help it.     I’ve been working on my self-esteem and trying to focus on the positives in our relationship, but the paranoia still lingers. I’m not sure if this is something I can overcome on my own or if I should seek professional help.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with these feelings? Any advice on how to manage this paranoia would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I've been microdosing with psilocybin for the past few months, and while I've experienced some positive effects like increased creativity and improved mood, I've also been feeling a bit concerned about my mental health. I've read some anecdotal reports about microdosing potentially triggering psychosis in individuals who may be predisposed to it, and I can't help but wonder if I might be one of those people.    I have a family history of mental health issues, and while I haven't experienced any severe symptoms myself, I do sometimes feel anxious or paranoid, especially when I'm under stress. Recently, I've noticed that during my microdosing days, I sometimes have fleeting thoughts that feel a bit out of control, like I'm losing touch with reality.     I’m curious if anyone else has had similar experiences or if there are any precautions I should take while continuing to microdose. Should I consider taking a break or consulting a mental health professional? I really want to enjoy the benefits of psychedelics without risking my mental well-being. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been contemplating whether to pursue my studies at a private university or a global university, and I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic.    From what I've gathered, private universities often offer smaller class sizes and more personalized attention from professors, which can be beneficial for students who thrive in a more intimate learning environment. However, they can also come with a hefty price tag, and I'm concerned about the return on investment.    On the other hand, global universities tend to have a more diverse student body and a wider range of resources, including research opportunities and international connections. This could be advantageous for networking and career prospects after graduation. However, I worry about the larger class sizes and whether I would get lost in the crowd.    What are your experiences with either type of institution? How did you choose between the two, and what factors influenced your decision? Any advice for someone trying to make this important choice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just saw the announcement that No Man's Sky is finally coming to Mac! 🎉 As a long-time player on PC, I’m super excited to see this game make its way to the Mac community.     For those of you who have played it on PC, what are your thoughts on how it will run on Mac? Do you think the performance will hold up? I know there are some concerns about graphics and optimization, especially with the vastness of the universe and all the procedural generation.     Also, for any Mac users out there, what are you most looking forward to? Exploring new planets, building bases, or maybe just the sheer beauty of the game?     Let’s discuss! What are your hopes for this release?

__label__0 Reading the TU about Amtrak I was once again reminded that while traffic is backed up on the North way every single day while 45,000 state workers go up north there is an existing rail line that goes from Albany to Schenectady then north through Saratoga.     Imagine a cheap Metro North type ride on this track. Why hasn't this been done over the last 50 years?
__label__1 I've been working at my job for about a year now, and there's this co-worker, "Mark," who just can't seem to take a hint. At first, I thought he was just being friendly, but it's become increasingly clear that he's interested in me romantically, and I'm not interested in him at all.    At work, he often finds excuses to come over to my desk, whether it's to ask about a project or just to chat. I try to keep our conversations professional and brief, but he seems to linger and often makes comments that feel a bit too personal. For example, he once asked me about my weekend plans and then suggested we should hang out outside of work. I politely declined, saying I was busy, but he keeps bringing it up.    I've also noticed that he tries to touch my arm or shoulder when he talks to me, which makes me uncomfortable. I've subtly tried to create distance by not engaging in small talk and keeping my responses short, but he doesn't seem to get the message.     Recently, I overheard him telling another co-worker that he thinks I might be playing hard to get, which is frustrating because I’ve been clear in my body language and responses that I’m not interested. I don’t want to create a hostile work environment, but I also don’t want him to keep pursuing me.     What should I do? Should I have a direct conversation with him about my feelings, or is there a better way to handle this situation? I really want to maintain a professional atmosphere at work without making things awkward.
__label__0 Got a rectifier for a DC brake on a crane. 130vdc at rest, you pull the contactor in, no load on the other end, the DC voltage jumps to 172vdc. And this is a brand new rectifier, the one I replaced was jumping over 200vdc? Any suggestions?
__label__0 So if you did, you will be issued a “virtual card” on the DasherDirect app and your physical card won’t arrive in the mail (from what I heard), a month later.     This BIGGEST issue with this is, you cannot access actual cash until the physical card arrives. To get around this bullshit, add your virtual card to your Apple Wallet. Also, add your real debit card to your Apple Wallet if you haven’t already done so. Add funds to your Apple Pay card (also in your Apple Wallet) from your Dasher Direct card. Then transfer funds from your Apple Pay card to your real debit card instantly.     It’s a hassle, but you have cash money. Rather than a virtual card that’s not promised to go through when you make purchases at stores, and more importantly the gas station.     The pros for the Dasher Direct card are you don’t have to pay $1.99 to cash out (only limited to once a day), and you have your money each time you end your dash. So if you can deal with the hassle of transferring money via Apple Wallet while your card arrives, I would say it’s worth it (so far).

__label__1 Hey NEO community!     I wanted to share some exciting news about AquaTank, a new project that’s making waves in the NFT space. AquaTank allows users to mint lifetime reward-based NFTs that offer a 2% reward in USDT. This means that by holding these NFTs, you can potentially earn around $162 per day!     What’s even more impressive is that AquaTank has undergone a double audit, ensuring that the project is secure and trustworthy. They have also confirmed a listing on Bitmart, which is a significant step for any new token.     Currently, AquaTank is live on Pinksale for a FairLaunch, and I’m happy to report that they have successfully hit their soft cap. This is a great opportunity for those looking to get involved in a project that combines the growing NFT market with passive income potential.     If you’re interested in minting these NFTs or learning more about AquaTank, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any questions you might have! Let’s discuss how this could be a game-changer in the NFT and DeFi space.
__label__0 I keep seeing more and more people ascending and I still haven’t ever seen a place with them in stock :/ just curious where folks are finding them!
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about how neurodivergent individuals, particularly those of us with ADHD and autism, experience emotions like excitement. It seems like there’s a unique flavor to it that can be quite different from what I observe in neurotypical friends and family.    For me, excitement often feels like a whirlwind. When I get excited about something, it’s like my brain is firing on all cylinders, and I can’t help but hyper-focus on that one thing. It’s exhilarating but also overwhelming at times. I find myself bouncing from one thought to another, and I can’t always articulate what I’m feeling because it’s just so intense.     I’ve noticed that my excitement can also lead to sensory overload. For example, if I’m at a concert or a big event, the lights, sounds, and energy can be both thrilling and exhausting. I love the rush of excitement, but I also have to be careful not to push myself too far, or I risk crashing afterward.    I’m curious if others feel this way too. Do you experience excitement in a way that feels different from how others describe it? Do you find it leads to sensory overload, or do you have strategies to manage it? I’d love to hear your experiences!

__label__1 I recently had my Invisalign consultation, and my orthodontist mentioned that one of the goals of my treatment is to move my top teeth upwards rather than backwards. I’m a bit confused about what this means and how it will affect my overall smile and bite.     From what I understand, moving teeth upwards can help create a more aesthetically pleasing smile by improving the alignment of the upper teeth with the lower teeth. But I’m curious about the mechanics behind it. How does Invisalign achieve this upward movement? Is it common for people to have their teeth moved in this way during treatment?     Also, are there any specific challenges or considerations I should be aware of when it comes to this type of movement? I want to make sure I have realistic expectations about the process and the results. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 It was a book set around modern times where martial arts are very prevalent. Wasn’t really a cultivation novel and most of the action was centered around tournaments. The main characters main “power” was his almost endless stamina.
__label__1 I just wanted to share my experience because I know many new parents go through tough times adjusting to the changes that come with a baby. After our little one arrived, my husband and I found ourselves in a bit of a rut. Between sleepless nights, constant diaper changes, and the overwhelming feeling of being new parents, we started to drift apart.     I didn’t realize how much stress I was holding in until I found myself not wanting to talk to him at all. It was almost a week of silence, and it felt so strange. I was frustrated with him for not helping enough, and he was feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to support me.     Finally, I broke the silence and we had a long, honest conversation about our feelings. It was a relief to express what we were both going through. We realized that we were both struggling but in different ways, and that communication was key.     If anyone else is feeling this way, I just want to say that it’s okay to have tough moments. It’s important to talk it out, even when it feels hard. We’re still learning how to navigate this new chapter together, and I think we’re getting better at it. Just remember, you’re not alone in this journey!

__label__1 I really wish FFXVI had more exploration and side quests that felt meaningful to the overall story. While the main narrative is gripping and the character development is top-notch, I found myself longing for the expansive world-building that previous titles like FFXI and FFXII offered.     In those games, side quests often revealed rich lore about the world and its inhabitants, and they felt like they added depth to the main story. In FFXVI, I feel like the side quests are a bit too formulaic and don’t always tie back into the larger narrative in a satisfying way.     For example, it would have been amazing to see more quests that delve into the history of the Eikons or the political tensions between the kingdoms. Imagine a quest where you could help a character uncover a long-lost artifact that ties back to the lore of the world, or even a quest that allows you to influence the outcome of a political conflict.     Additionally, I miss the feeling of truly exploring a vast world. While the environments in FFXVI are stunning, I wish there were more hidden areas, secrets, and optional bosses to discover. It would have been great to have a few more dungeons or areas that felt like they were off the beaten path, rewarding players for their curiosity.     Overall, I think adding more depth to the side quests and exploration would elevate FFXVI even further and give players a more immersive experience in this beautifully crafted world.
__label__1 As we eagerly await the announcement of the next Pokémon region, speculation is running wild about its theme and name. One intriguing theory suggests that the Gen 9 region will be named after light, and there are several reasons why this could be the case.    Firstly, the Pokémon franchise has a history of naming regions after natural elements or concepts. For instance, the Galar region is inspired by the UK, while Alola draws from Hawaiian culture. A region themed around light could symbolize hope, positivity, and new beginnings, which aligns perfectly with the overarching themes of many Pokémon games.    Additionally, light has been a recurring motif in Pokémon lore. Legendary Pokémon like Solgaleo and Xerneas embody the concept of light and life, suggesting that the next generation could explore these themes further. Imagine a region where light plays a crucial role in the environment, perhaps with unique mechanics involving day and night cycles or special light-based moves that could change the dynamics of battles.    Moreover, the visual aesthetics of a light-themed region could be stunning. Think of vibrant landscapes illuminated by dazzling sunlight, bioluminescent Pokémon, and cities that glow at night. This could provide a fresh and captivating experience for players, making exploration feel magical and immersive.    Finally, with the advancements in graphics and gameplay mechanics, a light-themed region could introduce innovative features, such as puzzles that require manipulating light or shadow to progress. This would not only enhance the gameplay but also deepen the connection between the player and the environment.    In conclusion, naming the Gen 9 region after light could open up a world of possibilities for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and visual design. It would be a fitting tribute to the enduring themes of the Pokémon series while also providing a fresh and exciting experience for both new and veteran players.
__label__1 I can't believe how Sierra has been acting lately! It's like she's on a whole different level of drama. The way she reacts to the smallest things is just wild. I mean, the other day she lost her phone for like 10 minutes and you would have thought the world was ending! She was crying and calling everyone to help her find it.     I get that losing your phone is frustrating, but come on! It really makes me wonder how she would handle real-life problems. If she can't keep it together over something so minor, how is she going to deal with actual stressors in life? I feel like she needs to take a step back and realize that not everything is a crisis.     I just hope she can learn to manage her emotions better because if she keeps this up, it's going to be exhausting for everyone around her. Anyone else feel the same way about her? It's like watching a soap opera unfold in real life!

__label__1 I've been considering starting an OnlyFans account for a while now, but I'm really torn about whether I should take the plunge or not. On one hand, I see so many creators making a decent income and enjoying the freedom that comes with it. On the other hand, I'm worried about privacy, the potential for negative judgment, and whether I can actually create content that people would want to pay for.    I’d love to hear from those of you who have taken the leap. What were your initial thoughts and concerns? How did you overcome them? Do you think it’s worth it? Any advice on how to get started or things to consider before diving in would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 So I was doing a randomizer and I noticed this lore tablet is in logic. However nothing I have can get anywhere close to it. I have left crystal dash, isma's, and both dashes but no claw or wings, so as far as I can tell there's no way to get onto the ledge. I've tried dying here but the shade spawns too far away, there's no way to pogo him to get up there. You can get there from queen's gardens but every pickup in QG is out of logic, so there's no way the rando thinks I can get there. The mask shard in the tunnel above is ALSO out of logic, so it doesn't think I can get up there. So for some reason the rando thinks I can make this jump? Please note I used debug to get onto the ledge just to show it off, so people could see. I did NOT make it up here legit.

I'm so confused, is there some black magic I've never seen?    \*Edit: if the post is weirdly formatted I apologize. This is my first ever reddit post and I added images while I was making it, but they all disappeared when I posted it so I had to add them afterward.
__label__0 Hi, I, 14m have been spending most of my last year on my phone, as with lockdown I’m sure most people have. I recently decided to switch to a flip phone to retain the call/text features, but to get away from all the unnecessary features and apps. However, I’m having doubts about if this is a good decision for me. Could anyone who has done the same thing or even just has any thoughts on the matter let me know? Thank you, and any help is appreciated.
__label__1 I'm in the mood for something new and exciting, but I'm open to any genre! Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, or even a good thriller, I'm ready to dive into a captivating story.     A few of my recent favorites include "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern for its magical realism, "Educated" by Tara Westover for a powerful memoir, and "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides for a gripping psychological thriller.     If you have any recommendations that you think I might enjoy, please share! I'm looking for something that will keep me engaged and make me want to read late into the night.

__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the relationship between benzo tolerance and cocaine use. I've been prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety for a while now, and I've noticed that my tolerance has definitely built up over time. I used to feel the calming effects pretty strongly, but now I find myself needing higher doses to achieve the same relief.    Recently, I decided to try cocaine for the first time, and I was surprised by how it affected me. I expected to feel a rush of euphoria and energy, but I found that my experience was somewhat muted. I couldn't help but wonder if my benzo tolerance was playing a role in how I reacted to the cocaine.     Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think that the tolerance built from long-term benzo use can dampen the effects of stimulants like cocaine? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences. Also, any tips on how to manage this situation would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 There's a lot of stigma around medication, at least I thought they were useless and addictive before I was forced to try them. It's been a year now but it feels like a lifetime. I can't even recognize who I was before. The difference is just night and day, I'm honestly happy and without medication I don't think I would be here. I tried every therapy for six years with no progress, I literally had a (physical)chemical imbalance in my brain. And if you have the time and money, maybe go see a psychiatrist, and maybe it will be the thing lets you see why life is so worth living. Good luck everyone, I feel for you because I've been there.    ( I know some people are not able to get professional help, and I really hope you can find other ways to get better &lt;3)

__label__0 Just a sequence of events over this past month which I believe might be related but I don't not have the mechanical knowledge to properly diagnose the problem.     It all started when my old battery went out. When I was getting a jump to go get the battery changed, I did notice some strange noise that sounded like a leak, or it could've been the compressor fan spooling.     After that battery change, my AC started to not function normally. It would get cold while I'm driving and sometimes when idling but usually it'll turn warm when idling and even sometimes while driving.     I went to some mechanic for the AC and one guy said the compressor isn't rotating and the second mechanic said it's working just fine. He changed a gasket and added Freon and replaced a faulty little 2-4mm plug where they add the Freon and test the system.     Worked fine for half a day and then it went back to warm when idling.       Today, I'm driving and I get a red flashing engine temp indicator warning. The interface tells me to slow the car down or pullover till the temps decrease. I've done it but it has returned to flash red now on 4 different occasions.       I live in a very hot country but I've had this car for 7 years now and It's never happened before.     I do not trust mechanics here. They are largely incompetent and would replace an entire unit to rather than diagnose the problem to see if it's just a simple fix. More money for them I guess.     I'm asking for some help for steps I can do to find out the problem. Or at least steps for things to look for so I know what I'm doing or talking about when I'm at the mechanics.     Thanks in advance, people.    2015 Mazda 3 Hatch and I love this car.

__label__1 Understanding crypto charts can be a daunting task for newcomers, but it's essential for making informed trading decisions. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and concepts to help you get started:    1. **Types of Charts**: The most common types of charts are line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts.      - **Line Charts**: These show the closing prices over a specific period and are great for visualizing trends.     - **Bar Charts**: These provide more information, showing the open, high, low, and close prices for a given time frame.     - **Candlestick Charts**: Similar to bar charts but more visually appealing, they also show the open, high, low, and close prices, with color coding to indicate price movement (green for up, red for down).    2. **Time Frames**: Charts can be viewed over various time frames, from minutes to days, weeks, or even months. Shorter time frames are useful for day trading, while longer time frames can help identify overall trends.    3. **Volume**: This indicates how much of a cryptocurrency was traded during a specific period. High volume can indicate strong interest and can confirm trends.    4. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Support is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. Resistance is the opposite, where an uptrend can pause due to a concentration of selling. Identifying these levels can help you make better trading decisions.    5. **Indicators**: There are various technical indicators that traders use to analyze price movements, such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). These can help you identify trends and potential reversal points.    6. **Trends**: Understanding whether the market is in an uptrend, downtrend, or sideways trend is crucial. An uptrend is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, while a downtrend has lower highs and lower lows.    7. **Chart Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common chart patterns like head and shoulders, triangles, and flags. These patterns can indicate potential future price movements.    8. **News and Events**: Always consider external factors that can affect price movements, such as regulatory news, technological advancements, or market sentiment.    By combining these elements, you can start to interpret crypto charts more effectively. Remember, practice makes perfect, so spend time analyzing different charts and trends to build your confidence. Happy trading!

__label__1 A while back, I made a post discussing my experiences with Muslim men and the dynamics I observed within the community. Since then, I've had time to reflect on my journey as an ex-Muslim and how my views have evolved.     Initially, I felt a lot of anger and resentment towards the men I encountered, particularly regarding the expectations placed on women and the often toxic masculinity that seemed prevalent. I was frustrated by the way many men justified their behavior through religious texts, using them as shields against accountability.     However, as I distanced myself from the faith, I began to see things from a broader perspective. I realized that many of these men were also trapped in a system that dictated their behavior and beliefs. They were raised in an environment that taught them to view women as lesser, and while that doesn't excuse their actions, it does provide context.     I've come to understand that the issues I faced were not solely about individual men but rather about a culture that perpetuates these harmful ideologies. This realization has allowed me to approach my past with a bit more compassion, even if I still hold firm to my beliefs about the need for change.     Now, as I navigate life outside of Islam, I find myself advocating for healthier relationships and mutual respect between genders. I believe that by sharing our stories and experiences, we can help dismantle the harmful narratives that have been ingrained in us.     I’m curious to hear from others who have had similar experiences. How have your views on gender dynamics changed since leaving Islam? What steps do you think we can take to foster healthier relationships in our communities?
__label__1 Hi everyone,    I just wanted to share that my laparoscopy, which was scheduled for the 15th, has been cancelled. I’m feeling really sad and disappointed right now. After waiting so long for this surgery, I was finally feeling hopeful that I might get some answers and relief from this relentless pain.     I know that cancellations happen for various reasons, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m back at square one. I’ve been struggling with endometriosis for years, and the thought of having to wait even longer for a new date is really disheartening.     If anyone has been through a similar situation, I would love to hear how you coped with the disappointment. Any tips on how to stay positive during this waiting period would be greatly appreciated.     Thanks for listening, everyone. Sending love to all of you who are also dealing with this condition. 💕

__label__0 https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/us-senate-candidate-kelly-tshibaka-says-god-is-sending-her-into-government-to-rule-and-subdue/    Kelly Tshibaka, a Trump-endorsed candidate who is seeking to unseat Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska’s Republican primary, spoke in May at North Kenai Chapel in Kenai, Alaska, in May, where she declared that “God created government” and that she has been “sent to the harvest field of government.”    During her remarks, Tshibaka warned that Christians are failing God if they are not working to actively influence government and politics.    God is so involved in government, Tshibaka claimed, that he is responsible for creating the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.    “Do you know who created government?” Tshibaka asked rhetorically. “Here it is: Genesis 1:28. You got to know your Bible. It’s a story. If you read it the way I read it, it’s the best book ever. ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the Earth.'”
__label__0 I feel a bit ashamed about this but i needed to ask anyway. Im really shy and introverted so its always been hard for me to talk to new people, the only friends ive had in my life were either people ive known since kindergarten or social butterflies who just talk to everyone. But now that ill be moving for college in September im worried ill have to spend my time alone when im not in class since i have genuinely no idea how i can make friends that share the same interests as me, and its become harder and harder for me to open up to people because of some stuff that happened to me in the past. If anyone has some advice id really appreciate it.
__label__1 I can't believe this is happening right outside my house. I just heard a bunch of loud bangs and at first, I thought it was fireworks or something, but then I saw people running and screaming. I’m freaking out right now.     I’ve locked all the doors and turned off the lights. My heart is racing and I can’t stop shaking. I don’t know what to do. I just hope everyone is okay.     Has anyone else experienced something like this? What should I do? Should I call the police or just stay quiet and wait it out? This is so scary.
__label__1 I have an 87 Ford F150 that I've been having some starting issues with lately. I suspect it might be the battery, but I want to do a temporary test before I commit to buying a new one.     Here's what I'm thinking: I have an old battery from another vehicle that I know is still good. Can I just swap it into the F150 for a short period to see if that resolves the starting issue?     Are there any specific precautions I should take when doing this? Also, is there anything else I should check while I have the battery out, like the terminals or cables?     Thanks in advance for any advice!
__label__1 I’m a 35-year-old man looking to connect with adventurous women aged 30 to 40 who are open to exploring new experiences, both in and out of the bedroom. I believe that life is too short to play it safe, and I’m eager to meet someone who shares that mindset. Whether it’s trying out a new hobby, going on spontaneous trips, or exploring our intimate sides, I’m all about making the most of every moment.    I’m a firm believer in communication and consent, and I think it’s important to establish a connection based on trust and mutual interests. If you’re someone who enjoys a good laugh, loves to have fun, and is ready to embrace new adventures, I’d love to hear from you! Let’s chat and see where our chemistry takes us.
__label__1 Hey fellow INFPs! I have a random question that’s been on my mind lately. If you could live in any fictional universe for a week, where would you choose to go and why?     For me, I think I’d love to spend some time in the world of Studio Ghibli films, like Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The whimsical landscapes, the magical creatures, and the deep emotional connections between characters really resonate with me. Plus, who wouldn’t want to hang out with Totoro?     I’m curious to hear your thoughts! What world would you escape to, and what draws you to it? Let’s dream a little together! 🌌✨
__label__0 Basically the title. I'm new to the tcg and got a Dracovish V card out of the Deck Builder Kit. I think it's really great and plan to start building a deck around it, but I'm a little afraid of dropping to much money on configuring a deck if there's going to be a whole new set of opportunities for power creep in only a couple months. How cemented is the V mechanic? is Dracovish likely to fall off?
__label__1 I took some shrooms yesterday for the first time, and honestly, I didn’t feel much. I had about 2 grams of dried Golden Teachers, which I thought was a decent starting dose. I prepared them by making a tea, hoping that would help with absorption. I was in a comfortable setting, with some chill music and good vibes, but after about an hour, I still felt pretty much the same.     I was expecting some visuals or at least a shift in my perception, but it just didn’t happen. I did feel a little more relaxed and had some giggles, but nothing like what I’ve read about. I’m wondering if I might have done something wrong or if it’s just that my body didn’t react to them.     Has anyone else experienced this on their first trip? Should I try a higher dose next time, or is it better to stick with the same amount until I get a better feel for it? Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I’ve been reflecting on the concept of putting the Lord to the test, especially in light of Matthew 4:7 where Jesus responds to the devil by saying, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." It raises an interesting question for me: is it ever appropriate to challenge God or ask for signs in our faith journey?    I know that many of us have moments of doubt or uncertainty, and sometimes we seek reassurance from God. I’ve found myself praying for specific signs or answers, hoping to feel His presence more tangibly in my life. But I also wonder if this is a form of testing Him, and if so, what the implications of that might be.    How do you all navigate this tension? Is there a difference between seeking confirmation of faith and putting God to the test? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Have you ever felt like you were testing God, and how did that impact your relationship with Him?
__label__1 Quiet quitting has become a popular term lately, and it raises an interesting debate about employee engagement and workplace culture. On one hand, some might view quiet quitting as a sign of a bad employee who is disengaged and not willing to go above and beyond in their role. This perspective often emphasizes the importance of dedication and commitment to one's job, suggesting that employees should always strive to exceed expectations and contribute to the company's success.    On the other hand, many argue that quiet quitting can be a smart move, especially in environments where employees feel overworked, undervalued, or unappreciated. In this context, quiet quitting might be a form of self-preservation, where employees set boundaries to maintain their mental health and work-life balance. It can also be a response to a lack of support or recognition from management, signaling that the workplace culture needs to change.    Ultimately, whether quiet quitting is seen as a sign of a bad employee or a smart one may depend on the specific circumstances of the workplace and the individual's reasons for their behavior. What do you think? Is quiet quitting a red flag, or is it a necessary response to a toxic work environment?
__label__1 I’ve been playing FIFA for years, but I think I’ve hit my breaking point with FIFA 23. I started off excited, but after just a few weeks, I’m already feeling burnt out. The gameplay feels off, and the constant connection issues are driving me crazy. I’ve tried to push through, but every time I log in, I just feel more frustrated than excited.     I’ve also noticed that the player market is a mess right now. Prices are all over the place, and it feels impossible to build a decent squad without spending a fortune. I thought I could grind my way to a good team, but it seems like the grind is just not worth it this year.     Has anyone else felt this way? Is it just me, or is FIFA 23 really that disappointing? I’m considering taking a break and coming back later, but I hate to give up so soon. What do you all think?
__label__1 I've seen a lot of movies where police officers can just take someone's car on the spot for various reasons, like if they suspect it's stolen or if the driver is acting suspiciously. Is that really how it works in real life? Can police actually seize a vehicle without a warrant or any prior notice? What are the legal grounds for them to do so, and are there any specific situations where this is allowed? I'm curious about the actual laws and procedures behind this, as it seems quite dramatic in films!
__label__1 As a lad from the midlands, I've been thinking about the differences in how we all experience life in our respective parts of Ireland. So, I have a question for you all: what’s one thing you miss about your hometown when you’re away?     For me, it’s definitely the sound of the local GAA matches on a Sunday afternoon. There’s something about the atmosphere, the cheers, and even the banter from the sidelines that just feels like home. I’ve tried to catch a few matches in Dublin, but it’s just not the same without the familiar faces and the local rivalry.     What about you? Is it the food, the people, or maybe a specific event that you look forward to when you go back? Let’s hear your stories!
__label__1 I'm starting a new business and I'm in need of some creative name ideas! The business will focus on eco-friendly products, specifically reusable household items like bags, straws, and containers. I want the name to reflect sustainability and a commitment to the environment, but also be catchy and memorable.     Here are a few ideas I've come up with:  1. GreenNest  2. EcoEssentials  3. Sustainably Yours  4. EarthWise Goods  5. Reuse Revolution    What do you think of these? Do you have any other suggestions or variations? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

__label__0 I don't even remember how I ended up on that website today. It's been close to ten years since I was active on it, and I've always had some stupid excuse for why "it's actually a better idea to leave it up actually you know just in case", but on this blessed day I plucked up the courage to just get rid of it.      The 2010s were a pretty shitty decade for me (big part of the reason why I stopped using Facebook). For ten years I've been stuck in a box reliving the same stupid day over and over, and going through my profile just now I could physically feel myself lose the will to live again. But thankfully the last time anybody sent me anything on Facebook was three years ago and it's basically already a dead account anyway.      So I looked around a bit and saw some old pictures of me from when I was livelier, some from before I completely fell apart, and some from when I was expecting to be dead any day soon (still fighting this every day, but I'm a lot better now than I was then.)      I also saw my old friends, most of who I lost touch with well over five years ago. They're doing so well and I'm so happy for them. People I hung out with daily, some I grew very close to (one absolutely crushed my heart into paste😅), one I'm still in touch with today somehow, cool guy.. But then I realised I couldn't find one particular old classmate, and it hit me that they probably deleted their account, and that realisation gave me exactly the boost I needed.      So I downloaded some photos I still wanted to remember, took a deep breath and clicked \[Delete Account\]. I didn't even realise this was a burden I was carrying, but I'm so much happier to have done it than I thought I'd be. This wasn't meant to be a big deal, but I just feel so relieved and I needed to tell somebody about it. It feels like I've finally said goodbye to that pileup of a decade no matter how much nicer or shittier my life is going to be going forward.
__label__1 In today's fast-paced digital world, online video interviews have become an essential tool for businesses looking to streamline their hiring processes. Here are six compelling reasons why you should consider incorporating online video interviews into your lead generation and recruitment strategy:    1. **Wider Reach**: Online video interviews allow you to connect with candidates from anywhere in the world. This means you can tap into a larger talent pool, ensuring you find the best fit for your business without geographical limitations.    2. **Time Efficiency**: Scheduling and conducting in-person interviews can be time-consuming for both recruiters and candidates. Video interviews eliminate travel time and can be conducted at the convenience of both parties, making the process faster and more efficient.    3. **Cost-Effective**: By reducing the need for travel and in-person meetings, online video interviews can significantly cut down on recruitment costs. This is especially beneficial for small businesses or startups that may have limited budgets.    4. **Enhanced Candidate Experience**: Candidates appreciate the flexibility that video interviews offer. They can participate from the comfort of their own homes, which can help reduce anxiety and create a more relaxed interview environment, leading to a better overall experience.    5. **Improved Assessment**: Video interviews allow you to assess candidates not just on their qualifications, but also on their communication skills and personality. You can gauge their enthusiasm and cultural fit more effectively through video than through a traditional resume alone.    6. **Record and Review**: One of the unique advantages of video interviews is the ability to record sessions. This allows hiring teams to review interviews later, ensuring that no detail is missed and enabling better decision-making when it comes to selecting the right candidate.    Incorporating online video interviews into your lead generation strategy can not only enhance your recruitment process but also help you attract top talent more efficiently. If you haven't already, consider making the switch to video interviews to stay competitive in today's job market.
__label__0 Hi everyone! I’m hoping you guys can help me out with selecting a new camera.    I currently have an SL1 which is honestly a pretty decent camera for my needs. I can always get some really good photos with my 50mm 1.8 with some minor work in Lightroom. My price range is around $500-600 for a body. I have a few decent EF lenses on hand.    I’m planning on selling it to purchase a new camera for regular family needs. Photography and videography have always been a hobby of mine. My biggest issue with the SL1 is the lack of dual pixel AF which is the main reason for my upgrade. I have been exploring a few of the obvious options – SL3, T7i, M50, etc. 4K isn’t a huge necessity for me, especially given the lack of 4K dual pixel AF and the current crop factor for cameras in my price range. I also like the size of a bigger DSLR. The SL1 has always felt a bit small in my hand.    I use an 80D regularly at work to take employee headshots and shooting corporate video content. Mostly ‘talking head’ style of video interviews that all take place inside in a light controlled environment. I work in lightroom and premier pro semi-often. I would love an 80D, but the price is just a little more than I’d like to spend especially considering the age of the camera.    I’m pretty much up-to-date on all of the pros and cons of each camera. I was just hoping to hear some opinions from enthusiasts since there seems to be quite a few options that would fill my needs as a hobbyist in the new/used $500-600 price range. I’m not looking to become a professional in the future, i'm just semi-experienced hobbyist looking for a solid overall good camera that will last me the next 5 years.    This subreddit has been a tremendous resource for so many. I appreciate your time!

__label__1 I came across these mushrooms while sorting through a woodpile near Salem, Oregon. The area is pretty dry, and I’m not entirely sure what species they might be. They have a distinct shape and color, but I’m not experienced enough to identify them confidently.     I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference. If anyone has any ideas or can help with identification, I’d really appreciate it! Also, any tips on foraging safely in this region would be great. Thanks in advance!
__label__0 seriously. I started only using recipes where grams were listed any my cooking stopped being hit or miss and started being mostly hit.    &amp;#x200B;    Can we make a new internet law that all recipes list their dry ingredients in grams?
__label__0 Hey guys, I have no one else in my real life other that I can share this with because they don’t know that I’m dating and I’ve got to keep it secret due to coming from a conservative family. I just want to say that I love my boyfriend endlessly. He’s so hardworking, smart, kind and perfect in all sorts of ways and inspires me to be better. I come from a dysfunctional family and the idea of marriage and just a significant other in general was terrifying. I currently haven’t moved out yet because I’m still completing university, so I’m still stuck at home with them, but having my boyfriend in my life just makes all the things I go through that much more bearable. It might be weird to say, but I feel like he’s an answer to all of my prayers. He’s there for me when I feel down and without him knowing, he’s helping me heal from burnout and any other mental issues that I’ve accumulated due to a rough home life. Honestly, all it takes is one good morning text from him to put a smile on my face. Before him, it’s depressing to say, but I genuinely wanted to run away and maybe end my life because I thought I was going to be forced into an arranged marriage with someone of my parents’ choosing and the days after that would be even more miserable than how it was growing up with them. He’s such a blessing and a gift, I find myself bawling my eyes out in the middle of the night sometimes because I never even dreamt of ever meeting someone who has had such a positive impact on my life. Im not sure if I deserve him. But I just know I love him with all of my heart and I hope this lasts forever.  He’s coming down to visit in a few months and I’m so excited!     That’s it you guys. Thank you so much for reading😊
__label__1 I just finished watching KSI's latest video and I have to say, it was absolutely outstanding! The energy, the humor, and the insane challenges he took on were next level. I love how he keeps pushing the boundaries and trying new things. The editing was on point too, really added to the overall vibe of the video.     Also, can we talk about the collabs? Seeing him team up with other creators always brings a fresh dynamic and makes for some hilarious moments. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!     What did you all think? Did anyone else find themselves laughing out loud? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 So, for context, me (15f) and my boyfriend (14, soon to be 15, ftm) have been dating for almost 3 years now, maybe almost 4, its hard to decifer as I'm really horrible with dates. We have been best friends since kindergarten, and we are about to go into grade 10, so we've known eachother for around a decade now, including our romantic relationship. The problem is is that...I dont know, its hard to explain. It was both of our first relationships, and we were only around 12/13 at the time we started dating.     So, we were learning. Learning how to..."relationship." For the first year, I tried to, well, I tried to make it romantic. You know, cuddling, holding hands, what you do in a relationship when you're young. But, it was never really, reciprocated that much? He'd let me cuddle him and hold his hand but he never initiated it first, and when he said "I love you too" for the first time I was so ecstatic I genuinely cheered and gushed to my friend because, well, he had never done that before. The problem with this is that I'm a very affectionate person, I need physical and emotional affection, I need/adore cuddles, hand holding, and "I love you"'s a lot, whether our relationship is platonic or romantic, I hold hands with pretty much all my friends, I cuddle them, I tell them I love you and they say it back or tell me it as well. Its how I work.     Even though I wasn't getting that, of course I was in the honeymoon faze. I loved him so much. When covid hit, though, thats when it started taking a turn, and we barely ever talked. Ever. Maybe once a month but even that was a stretch, for 2 years, that happened. And then he started attending school again. It was nice, but the problem was was that I started to realize how....little I was getting from our relationship. In a way that, it was like we were still only friends, but only I was tied down and not allowed to date anyone or be with anyone or have anything romantic.     I realized, that through our entire relationship, we were basically still just friends, just with a different title. We barely ever communicated our relationship, unless it was me starting it because I was desperate for anything other than saying I had a lover when it never even felt like it, and I do take blame for that. Neither of us communicated with eachother. That's probably why this isn't working out, we never ever talked about anything. We just...let it die.     I started to not hang out with my usual group at lunch anymore, I used to tell myself it was because one of them made me really uncomfortable, but then I also started to realize, it was emotionally draining being around that group as a whole. One friend made me super uncomfortable, and the other, my boyfriend, he only ever talked about himself, only him. Never let anyone mention themselves, and it was *draining.* not to mention that we BARELY talk, I havent talked to him in probably over a month, and we barely interacted at school, either. It was even to the point where I had recieved so many comments from people thinking I was dating my best friend yet nobody had even thought of me being in a relationship with my actual partner.    But the final straw, was when he came out as trans. I have no problem with it, I'm actually very proud of him for doing so. I know its hard. My best friend is also a trans man, and I've been helping him through every struggle he's had to face ever since he found out, I know how difficult that would have been for him. The problem is, is that I'm a lesbian. I like women, and this wouldn't even be an issue if he *talked* to me about it. But he didnt. My final straw was that, when he came out, he just announced it to a gc with a bunch of other friends and never once thought to talk to his lesbian gf about it and what that meant for their relationship. I found out at the same time as a bunch of others who weren't in this position, no warning, no conversation. I should have been the one to strike up the conversation, and I'm now regretting that I didn't. I didn't think of it until now. My best friend questioned our relationship in my dms a few minutes later and I then started to feel so horrible, and then later decided that, I think it was time we went back to being friends.    The thing is, is that was....months ago. Probably when there was still a quarter of the year left last year. I'm incredible socially awkward and have really extreme social anxiety, so I kept putting it off, and putting it off, every time I told myself to do it I'd spiral into something of an anxiety attack. I'd had multiple mental breakdowns about because I felt so horrible, and so trapped.     I felt so bad because I felt like I was invalidating him as a trans man, and I also felt bad because, I was so deprived of the romantic attraction I craved that I started falling for a friend of mine that I dont even see often, I was so in love, so starstruck when we hung out and the entire time I was wallowing in so much guilt.    I decided to meet up with him, hang out, and go around town with him, my plan was to be back at the park we were meeting at and break it to him there, but we ran late and by the time we got back there was no time. I even stopped him, but the moment I did I started to shake so severely, I couldn't breathe, I was on the verge of tears, and I backed out. I shook my head and told him that I was just catching my breath for a second. He left, and I went home feeling so guilty. At this point both my mom and my best friend were telling me to break it to him over text, but I googled it and it seemed so horrible to do. Even if I dont like him romantically I still love him as a person and as a friend, I could never hurt him like that. I dont want to be a selfish, immature coward who broke off an almost 3 year long relationship over text, and I most certainly don't want to leave him hurt and confused. But every time I try to break up irl, I spiral so hard into panic that I just can't do it no matter how hard I'm trying. I dont want to lead him on in this endless relationship where we never speak, and I want to he free again. I want a loving gf who I can cuddle and hug and care for, I want *love*, I dont want to feel this way, but I genuinely don't know how to go about it.    Should I follow my best friend and mom's advice and just...do it over text? Or, should I somehow, do it in person? And, if so, how? How should I go across it? Should I prepare like, a speech of sorts?    TL;DR: I no longer want to be in a relationship but I do not know how to break it off with my extreme anxiety
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m a 31-year-old female looking to break out of this boring routine I’ve found myself in. I’m a bit of a nerd, so I love all things geeky—video games, sci-fi, fantasy, you name it! But I’m also open to chatting about anything and everything, so don’t be shy!    I’m hoping to find someone who can take me out of this funk, whether it’s through fun conversations, virtual hangouts, or even meeting up if you’re nearby. I’m all about exploring new interests and sharing laughs, so if you’re looking for a friend (or maybe more), let’s connect!    A little about me: I enjoy reading, binge-watching shows, and I’m always down for a good board game night. I’m not too picky about looks, just someone who can vibe with my nerdy side and maybe introduce me to some new hobbies.    If you’re interested, drop me a message! Looking forward to hearing from you!

__label__1 I've been diving into Far Cry 5 on Infamous difficulty, and let me tell you, it's a whole different beast! Here are some tips that have helped me survive and thrive in this challenging mode:    1. **Stealth is Key**: On Infamous difficulty, enemies are much more alert and can take you down quickly. Use stealth to your advantage. Crouch, use silenced weapons, and take out enemies one by one to avoid drawing attention.    2. **Upgrade Wisely**: Focus on upgrading your health and resistance first. The more health you have, the longer you can survive in firefights. Also, consider perks that enhance your stealth and crafting abilities.    3. **Use the Environment**: Take advantage of the terrain. Use high ground for sniping, and always be aware of your surroundings. You can use bushes and trees to hide from enemies and plan your next move.    4. **Crafting and Resources**: Make sure to gather resources and craft items whenever possible. Molotovs, grenades, and health kits can turn the tide in tough situations. Always keep your inventory stocked.    5. **Choose Your Fights**: Not every encounter is worth engaging in. If you find yourself outnumbered or outgunned, it might be better to sneak past or retreat to fight another day.    6. **Utilize Companions**: Don’t forget about your allies! They can provide valuable support in combat. Choose companions that complement your playstyle, whether you prefer stealth or all-out assault.    7. **Plan Your Loadout**: Before heading into a mission, think about your loadout. A mix of long-range and close-quarters weapons can be beneficial. Also, consider bringing a vehicle for quick escapes if things go south.    8. **Save Often**: Make use of the manual save feature. If you’re about to enter a tough area, save your game first. This way, if you die, you won’t lose too much progress.    9. **Learn Enemy Patterns**: Take some time to observe enemy patrols and behaviors. Knowing when to strike and when to hide can make a huge difference.    10. **Stay Calm**: It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but staying calm and thinking strategically will help you make better decisions in the heat of battle.    I hope these tips help you tackle Infamous difficulty! What strategies have you found effective? Let’s share our experiences!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I've recently upgraded from my Pixel 3 XL to the Pixel 7, and I was really excited about the camera improvements. However, I've been a bit disappointed with the results.     When I take photos, especially in low light, they seem grainy and not as sharp as I expected. I remember my Pixel 3 XL producing clearer images, and I thought the Pixel 7 would be a significant upgrade in that department.     I've tried adjusting the settings and using different modes, but the graininess persists. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any tips or settings I might be missing to improve the camera performance?     Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 Hi everyone,    I'm in the market for my first car and could really use some advice! I'm looking for something reliable, affordable, and easy to drive. My budget is around $15,000, and I would prefer a used car since I’m just starting out.    I’ve been considering a few options:  1. **Honda Civic** - I’ve heard great things about their reliability and fuel efficiency. Plus, they seem to hold their value well.  2. **Toyota Corolla** - Similar to the Civic, I know they are known for being dependable and have a good reputation for longevity.  3. **Mazda3** - I’ve read that they are fun to drive and have a nice interior, but I’m not sure about their reliability compared to Honda and Toyota.  4. **Hyundai Elantra** - I’ve seen some good deals on these, and they come with a great warranty, but I’m not sure how they compare in terms of resale value.    I’m also considering factors like insurance costs and maintenance. I’m not a car enthusiast, so I just want something that gets me from point A to point B without too much hassle.

__label__1 The American health care system is like a big puzzle with many pieces that don’t always fit together perfectly. Here’s a simple way to understand it:    1. **Insurance**: In the U.S., most people have health insurance, which is like a safety net that helps pay for medical costs. You can get insurance through your job, buy it yourself, or get it from the government if you qualify. But not everyone has insurance, and that can make it hard to afford care.    2. **Doctors and Hospitals**: When you get sick or hurt, you go to a doctor or a hospital. These places provide care, but they charge money for their services. If you have insurance, your insurance company pays part of the bill, and you pay the rest (this is called a copay or deductible).    3. **Costs**: Health care in America can be very expensive. Even with insurance, people can end up paying a lot of money for things like doctor visits, surgeries, or medicine. This is because there are many different prices for the same services, and it can be confusing.    4. **Government Programs**: There are some government programs to help people who can’t afford insurance, like Medicaid for low-income families and Medicare for older people. These programs help cover medical costs, but they have specific rules about who can use them.    5. **Challenges**: The system can be complicated and frustrating. Some people can’t get the care they need because they don’t have insurance or can’t afford the costs. There are also debates about how to make health care better and more affordable for everyone.    In short, the American health care system is a mix of private and public services that can be hard to navigate, and it often costs a lot of money.

__label__0 Hello,    Hope all of you are doing well.     I've been a marketing strategist for a decade now and just giving a few thoughts on the matter why Gonzaga made that infuriating statement that it benefited her in the end. Long story short, it did and she's right. You see, boycotting and letting a boycott trend is actually benefiting for both the party and the endorser. The endorser will get get paid no matter what since they get paid upfront and they will get paid even more if traffic and attention is directed to the entity that is trying to advertise no matter how negative the reception is.    This marketing strategy is called **MANUFACTURED CONTROVERSY.** The google definition of it is *a contrived disagreement, typically motivated by profit or ideology, designed to create public confusion concerning an issue about which there is no substantial academic dispute. This concept has also been referred to as manufactured uncertainty.*     Whoever the marketing strategist of Shopee is probably know what they were doing when they were hiring Gonzaga as their endorser since she's an infamous known figure currently and infamy drives more traffic and attention than that of a positive script.     Small history about this said strategy has been going on since the early 1980s but only really picked up  mid 2012. Disney were the first to apply this strategy to their products by hiring infamous personalities and using trending social issues to stir up a crowd. Universal pictures also started applying this strategy and made their first bold move with the movie called Snowhite by making Kirsten Stewart star as the lead role since she was an infamous figure due to the Twilight films. That film had a budget of around $170 Million to produce and ended up with $400 million dollars all thanks to the infamy it generated therfor in driving seats into theaters because people were curious.     The best way to counter this is to simply **IGNORE** and never talk about it or silently talk about it among your peers. Just boycotr the product and don't ever talk about it again. That's the best way to handle companies who use these kinds strategy.    &amp;#x200B;    Hope this gives you guys an at least shallow insight. Keep safe everyone.
__label__1 In Tolkien's legendarium, the fate of dead animals and Orcs is not explicitly detailed, but we can infer some possibilities based on the themes and lore presented in his works.    For animals, it is generally understood that they return to the earth, much like in our world. They are part of the natural cycle of life and death, and their spirits likely pass on to whatever afterlife exists for them, though Tolkien does not elaborate on this extensively. Animals in Middle-earth are often depicted as having a connection to the natural world, and their deaths contribute to the balance of nature.    As for Orcs, their fate is more complex. Orcs are corrupted beings, originally Elves who were twisted by Morgoth, and later bred by him. Their souls are tainted, and it is suggested that they do not have the same kind of afterlife as Men or Elves. In "The Silmarillion," it is implied that the spirits of Orcs may not find peace after death, possibly wandering the world as restless spirits or being drawn into the service of dark powers. This reflects Tolkien's themes of corruption and redemption, as Orcs are often portrayed as tragic figures, caught in a cycle of violence and servitude.    In summary, while the fate of dead animals seems to align with natural processes, the fate of Orcs is shrouded in darkness, reflecting their origins and the moral complexities of their existence in Tolkien's world. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think there is a chance for redemption for Orcs, or are they forever bound to their fate?

__label__1 Hello everyone!      I'm currently working on a React component that fetches data from an API using `useEffect` and manages the fetched data with `useState`. As I'm diving deeper into testing, I'm a bit unsure about the best practices for testing such components, especially when it comes to handling asynchronous data fetching.      Here's a simplified version of my component:    ```javascript  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';    const DataFetchingComponent = () => {      const [data, setData] = useState(null);      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);      const [error, setError] = useState(null);        useEffect(() => {          const fetchData = async () => {              try {                  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');                  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');                  const result = await response.json();                  setData(result);              } catch (error) {                  setError(error);              } finally {                  setLoading(false);              }          };          fetchData();      }, []);        if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;      if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;      return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;  };    export default DataFetchingComponent;  ```    Now, I want to write tests for this component using Jest and React Testing Library. Here are a few questions I have:  1. How do I mock the API call to ensure that my tests are not dependent on the actual API?  2. What is the best way to test the loading state, error state, and the successful data fetch?  3. Are there any specific patterns or utilities in React Testing Library that can help with testing components that rely on asynchronous data?    Any guidance or examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding the extent of Chinese transnational policing and its implications for global governance and human rights. Reports have surfaced about the Chinese government establishing unofficial police stations in various countries, ostensibly to monitor and control Chinese nationals abroad. This has raised alarms about sovereignty, the rule of law, and the potential for human rights abuses.    One of the most notable cases involved the discovery of these so-called "overseas police service stations" in countries like Canada, the United States, and several European nations. These stations are said to be used for a variety of purposes, including tracking down dissidents, enforcing Chinese laws, and even coercing individuals to return to China. The Chinese government claims these stations are meant to assist citizens with administrative tasks, but many view them as a means of extending China's authoritarian reach beyond its borders.    The implications of this transnational policing are profound. It raises questions about the safety of Chinese expatriates, the rights of individuals in host countries, and the responsibilities of those countries to protect their citizens from foreign interference. Moreover, it challenges the international community to respond to such actions, balancing diplomatic relations with the need to uphold human rights and national sovereignty.    As League of Legends players, we often discuss the importance of fair play and respect within the game. Similarly, the principles of fairness and respect for sovereignty should extend beyond the Rift and into the real world. How do you think the international community should respond to these developments? Should countries take a firmer stance against such practices, or is there a risk of escalating tensions with China? Let's discuss!

I've always been fascinated by the beauty and lifestyle up there, but I know it can be quite different from what I'm used to.     I’m currently single and hoping to meet new people once I arrive.

__label__1 I’m starting to take custom cake orders and I’m trying to figure out a fair price for a 6” layered cake. I want to make sure I cover my costs and time, but I also don’t want to scare away potential customers with a high price.     Here’s what I typically include in my cakes:  - High-quality ingredients (organic flour, real butter, etc.)  - Custom flavors (like chocolate ganache, vanilla bean, or lemon curd)  - Decorative elements (like buttercream flowers or fondant accents)  - Delivery (if applicable)    I’ve seen prices range from $30 to $75 depending on the complexity and decoration. I’m leaning towards around $50 for a basic design, but I’m unsure if that’s too low or too high.     What do you all think? What do you charge for a similar cake? Any tips on pricing would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Today marks 11 days alcohol-free for me, and I have to say, it’s been the most challenging day yet. I woke up feeling great, full of energy and optimism, but as the day progressed, the cravings hit me like a freight train.     I found myself in situations that would typically trigger my desire to drink. I went to a friend’s gathering where everyone was enjoying drinks, laughing, and having a good time. I felt that familiar pull, that voice in my head saying, "Just one won’t hurt. You can handle it now." But I reminded myself of why I chose to stop drinking in the first place.     I took a moment to step outside and breathe. I thought about the last few days, the clarity I’ve felt, the pride in my accomplishments, and how far I’ve come. I don’t want to throw that away for a fleeting moment of pleasure. I want to keep building on this momentum.     Instead of giving in, I reached out to a friend who knows about my journey. We talked about how tough it can be and how important it is to lean on each other during these moments. I also treated myself to a nice non-alcoholic drink and focused on enjoying the company around me.     It’s a reminder that the journey isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it. I’m proud of myself for making it through today without giving in. Here’s to more days of strength and resilience! 💪

__label__1 /r/worldnews      https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67012345      Colombia is witnessing a surge in protests following the tragic death of a man who was tasered by police during an altercation. The incident, which occurred in the city of Medellín, has ignited widespread outrage and led to violent clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Protesters are demanding accountability and justice, claiming that excessive force was used by the police.     As tensions escalate, reports indicate that at least three people have died in the ensuing violence, with many more injured. The government has called for calm, but the situation remains volatile as citizens express their frustration over police brutality and systemic issues within the law enforcement agencies.     This incident adds to a growing list of similar cases in Colombia, where public trust in the police has been severely eroded. Activists are urging for reforms to ensure that such tragedies do not happen again, while the international community watches closely as the situation unfolds.

__label__1 Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against auto lender Credit Acceptance Corp, which is also a target of Citron Research's short-selling campaign. The state is seeking $120 million in damages, alleging that the company engaged in predatory lending practices that disproportionately affected low-income borrowers. This lawsuit could have significant implications for the auto finance industry, especially for companies that operate in similar markets.    Citron Research has been vocal about its concerns regarding Credit Acceptance Corp, claiming that the company's business model is unsustainable and that it exploits vulnerable consumers. The combination of the state's legal action and Citron's short position could lead to increased scrutiny of the company's practices and potentially impact its stock price.    Investors should keep a close eye on this situation as it develops. If the lawsuit gains traction, it could lead to regulatory changes in the auto lending space, which might affect not only Credit Acceptance but also other lenders in the industry. Additionally, the outcome of this case could set a precedent for how states regulate auto financing and protect consumers.    What are your thoughts on this lawsuit? Do you think it will have a lasting impact on Credit Acceptance Corp and the auto lending market as a whole?

__label__1 It’s been a hot topic of discussion lately, especially with the ongoing debates around public health measures and the management of the pandemic in Alberta. Many people are wondering why Premier Danielle Smith has not yet made a move to fire Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the Chief Medical Officer of Health.    Some speculate that Dr. Hinshaw’s expertise and experience are still valued, despite the controversies surrounding her decisions during the pandemic. Others believe that firing her could lead to further instability in the public health response, especially as we navigate through the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19 and other health issues.    Additionally, there are political implications to consider. Smith may be weighing the potential backlash from the public and health professionals if she were to dismiss Hinshaw, especially since many Albertans have come to trust her guidance over the past few years.    What do you all think? Is it time for a change in leadership at Alberta Health, or should Dr. Hinshaw remain in her position? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I've been struggling with OCD for as long as I can remember, but lately, it's been particularly intense when it comes to my need for perfection. It feels like I can't settle for anything less than perfect in every aspect of my life—whether it's my work, my relationships, or even my personal projects.     For example, at work, I find myself spending hours on a single task, obsessively revising and rechecking every detail until I feel it's "just right." This often leads to me missing deadlines or feeling completely drained by the end of the day. I know that my colleagues are able to complete their tasks in a fraction of the time, and it makes me feel inadequate, but I can't help it. The thought of submitting something that isn't perfect fills me with anxiety.    In my personal life, this need for perfection seeps into my relationships too. I often feel like I have to be the perfect friend, partner, or family member. If I think I've said or done something wrong, I replay the situation in my head over and over, worrying about how it might have affected the other person. I end up over-apologizing or trying to overcompensate, which can be exhausting for both me and the people around me.    I know that perfection is an unrealistic standard, but the pressure I put on myself feels insurmountable. I often wonder if anyone else feels this way and how you cope with it. Do you have any strategies that help you manage the need for perfection? I could really use some advice or just to know that I'm not alone in this struggle.
__label__0 TLDR; my mum questioned about whether or not people actually wanted to be around me and took a critical hit to my already fragile self esteem and I'm not sure how to cope with her comments anymore    &amp;#x200B;    Hi, I've always had a kinda dodgy relationship with my mum and she quite often says stuff I find quite mean.    This is just an example of some mean stuff.    I kinda semi have "disordered eating" I wouldn't call it an eating disorder because I don't believe I have one and also I'm not officially diagnosed.  This year I went from overweight to underweight - when I was overweight she'd constantly make comments about how my jeans could probably fit her and my double chin was super noticeable (I actually had an underbite which I went to have corrective surgery for earlier this year which caused a double chin and soft jaw).  I always tell her to not comment on my weight or what I eat but she says that she's doing it out of concern.  Like telling me when we're eating out that I'm gonna end up like my (morbidly obese) grandparents and that she was so much skinnier than I was.  Now I've lost the weight she tells me that it's gross because I've got no ass and my body's unattractive.    A lot of comments on my appearance really - before the jaw surgery it was comments on that, I started puberty early so it was calling me gross when I had acne at 9 years old, getting me to dye my hair because she doesn't like the colour, telling me that she wouldn't wanna be seen on holiday with me because I'm too pale so I had to get naked in front of a woman to have a spray tan, telling me that my face looks like it has loads of holes in it (I do have open pores and I'm insecure about it you know), calling my eyebrows ugly until I agreed to get them done when I was about 11 etc.    Even though I'm 18 I'll still cry in arguments because I can't stand it when somebody yells at me and gets in my face, and my mum tries to intimidate.  In one argument I started crying and rather than continue insulting me she just started fake crying as well really loudly and wouldn't let me leave the room or talk - it was really embarassing and to this day she denies she did that.    I chose to go to the university she doesn't like and told me she'll no longer "pay for my education" which would have meant I wouldn't have been able to go (she's backed away now though because she can't hold to something like that with my dad in the picture).    Anyway she says none of this type of stuff around my dad because my dad would shut her down.  I do tell him but he always says "You can't change her you just have to take it on the chin".  British stiff upper lip and all that.  I think I've actually been quite good at just coping until the past year and a half where it's been affecting me so much more.    I'm at Uni now and I thought I'd gotten away from it, but everytime I talk to her on the phone she says "don't be argumentative because nobody will like you" as if that's a personality trait of mine, "don't act like x don't say y".  Today really upset me though because I'm doing a very male dominated subject so I thought it would be nice for girls in my accomodation doing my subject to have a picnic brunch (milkshakes and cookie dough and waffles :3) so I messaged a bunch of girls and asked them and they agreed.  I told her and she said "But are you sure they actually want to come?".  I was bullied and excluded in primary school and I didn't have a lot of friends in secondary or sixth form so I wanted to make some friends when I came to uni.  I know these girls might not be the ones I stick with forever but I'm so worried constantly that I'm going to be the person nobody wants to hang around.  People \*do\* say stuff you know behind other peoples' backs and I don't wanna be weird or lonely, I want friends and I want to do well.  But my mum is making me think that nobody will like me anyway and that was already kinda a concern of mine.    I'm not really sure how to kinda look past it, our relationship is getting rockier and sure I've told my dad but now he's sneaking around texting me to see if I'm okay because if he talks to her then it'll cause an argument, and he already has enough of those on account of trying to check her behaviour.
__label__0 Hello, I'm still young so I might miss a few details, but this is something that I have not only been aware of since I was 12 (19 and Male as I type this) but I was constantly questioning myself on My emotions. Or to be more specific, I don't really feel any emotions that much. They feel completely numb to me. Such as love, sadness, a state of genuine happiness, and grief and it eats me up inside.    To the point where I've had an existential crisis a few times from overthinking about it too much. I've thought about asking my parents but I wasn't sure if that would be able to help since the last time I told them It was when I was still at that young age. They pretty much told me that I'm fine and it's likely my hormones as I'm about to hit puberty. At that age I was only a little out of touch with my emotions and I took their advice and dismissed it, but when I hit puberty as the years went on I felt so dead inside that it took me going to my dad after he was diagnosed with leukemia for it to click that I wasn't panicked or stressed about it at all. I didn't cry, I didn't feel sadness, or fear over the fact that I might lose him. I felt nothing.    I just had an existential crisis to the point that I was hyperventilating and my mom and father figure basically thought I was taking it worse then my little brother took it. but it really was just a moment of emotional confusion that escalated quickly. I never told them due to me having problems with me speaking out about my emotions. I found this subreddit after I saw a recommended post from here. I looked through some of the posts And I thought to maybe vent this out and possibly get some answers.    Is this a sort of emotional disorder or something?     Or is there just something up with my emotions in general and I'm just overthinking it too much?
__label__1 Honestly, it's wild how both sides just keep throwing shade at each other instead of focusing on what really matters. Like, can we just agree that the pandemic was a mess no matter who was in charge? It's frustrating to see politicians play the blame game when so many people were affected. We need solutions, not more drama. Just my two cents.
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to share my story and ask for your support during a very challenging time in my life.     I recently spent four months in the hospital due to a serious health issue that required extensive treatment and recovery. While I am grateful to be on the mend, the time away from work has left me in a precarious financial situation. I have fallen behind on my rent and am now facing eviction.    I have always worked hard to support myself, but the unexpected medical emergency has taken a toll on my finances. I am doing everything I can to get back on my feet, but I need a little help to bridge the gap until I can return to work full-time.    I am asking for assistance to cover my rent and basic living expenses for the next couple of months. Any amount you can contribute would be immensely appreciated and would help me avoid eviction and the stress of homelessness.     Thank you for taking the time to read my story. If you are unable to donate, sharing this with your network would also mean the world to me. I am hopeful that with a little help, I can get back on track and continue to rebuild my life.    With gratitude,    [Your Name]    [Link to GoFundMe]
__label__1 I recently found out that my loans are serviced by MOHELA, and I'm considering consolidating them to simplify my payments and potentially qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). However, I have a few questions about the process and implications of consolidating with MOHELA.    1. **Impact on PSLF**: If I consolidate my loans, will I lose any qualifying payments I've already made towards PSLF? I’ve heard mixed things about this, and I want to make sure I don’t set myself back in my journey to forgiveness.    2. **Interest Rates**: What should I expect regarding interest rates when consolidating with MOHELA? I currently have a mix of federal loans with varying interest rates, and I’m concerned about how consolidation might affect my overall interest rate.    3. **Application Process**: What is the best way to initiate the consolidation process with MOHELA? Are there specific forms I need to fill out, or can I do it online?     4. **Income-Driven Repayment Plans**: After consolidation, will I still be able to apply for an income-driven repayment plan? I’m currently on REPAYE, and I want to ensure I can continue with a plan that works for my financial situation.    Any insights or experiences you all have had with MOHELA and consolidation would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I recently started working at Lowe's and I'm curious about the employee discount policy. I know that employees get a certain percentage off their purchases, but can this discount be used for the benefit of immediate family members? For example, if I buy something for my parents or siblings, can I use my discount on their behalf?     I want to make sure I'm following the rules correctly and not taking advantage of the system. If anyone has experience with this or knows the official policy, I would really appreciate your input!
__label__1 I (28 F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30 M) for about two years now. Overall, things have been great, but recently I've been feeling a bit uneasy about our future together. We’ve talked about moving in together, but he seems hesitant and often changes the subject when I bring it up.     I love him and can see a future with him, but I’m starting to wonder if he feels the same way. He often mentions wanting to travel and focus on his career, which I completely understand, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not a priority in his life.     Last week, I brought up the idea of moving in together again, and he said he’s not ready for that kind of commitment yet. I tried to express how I feel, but he brushed it off and said we have plenty of time.     I’m feeling confused and a bit hurt. I don’t want to pressure him, but I also don’t want to waste my time if we’re not on the same page. Should I give him more time to figure things out, or should I have a more serious conversation about where we stand? I really value our relationship, but I need to know if we’re heading in the same direction. Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way, but the constant presence of phones in the classroom is driving me up the wall! I’ve tried everything from setting clear rules about phone usage to implementing a phone basket at the front of the room, but it seems like students are more attached to their devices than ever.    I understand that technology can be a great tool for learning, but it often feels like it’s more of a distraction than anything else. I’ve noticed that students are more focused on their social media notifications than on the lesson at hand. It’s frustrating to see them scrolling through their feeds while I’m trying to engage them in a discussion or a group activity.    I’m reaching out to see how other teachers are handling this issue. What strategies have you found effective in managing phone use in your classrooms? Have you found a balance between allowing technology for educational purposes while minimizing distractions? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you might have!
__label__1 I've been using Duolingo for a while now and have built up a nice streak, but I'm about to go on a camping trip where I won't have any internet access for several days. I'm worried about losing my streak!     Does anyone have tips on how to maintain a streak without internet? I know there are offline lessons available, but I'm not sure how to make the most of them.     Also, if I do manage to complete some lessons offline, how do I ensure they sync properly once I regain internet access?     Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Hi everyone, I’m looking to get a 135 gal tank however I live in the second story of an apartment building. I had asked our building manager if they think the weight is an issue and she said no, the floors are made of concrete. However, I’m not sure I trust that. Any opinions? Thanks!
__label__0 Hey there! I have pretty bad hyperhidrosis on my palms. Whenever a bad sweating episode starts my hands will turn bright red, in particular my palms and the knuckles/joints on my hands. My hands also appear a lot more aged than other people my age (dry skin, fine lines) and I wonder if this is caused by HH (I've had it for life and am now 28). Anyone else have these same symptoms? The redness brings more attention to my hands which is so frustrating and I'm constantly trying to hide them.         Going to start using Dermadry iontophoresis soon - fingers crossed it works for me. Does anyone know if this would help reduce the redness too?

__label__0 Hey,    So I am not somebody who is very outgoing and at 28 years old, I am still fairly inexperienced when it comes to sex.  So this week, after months of abstinence, I was just so in the mood and went to a local cruising area where I blew and fingered a hot guy and we jerked off together. He also blew me and the entire experience was really hot. That was on Monday evening.   Now it is Wednesday and I have been feeling sore in my throat all day long. And my mind immediately jumped to an STD. Which, given covid is the less likely scenarios in 2022 I would assume.   I mean. It could theoretically be an STD, right? I met him while cruising, so a rather high risk scenario probably. But overall, I am becoming more and more anxious about the idea of having an STD while at the same time wanting to explore my sexuality more.   How do I balance this? And how do I face the reality that if I want to have sex with strangers, there will always be some risk involved?  Also, cruising appeals to me because I don’t feel entirely save going to somebody’s house either.
__label__1 I'm looking for recommendations for mystery novels that steer clear of the "woke" themes that have become prevalent in some contemporary literature. I enjoy classic whodunits, detective stories, or even psychological thrillers that focus more on the plot and character development rather than social commentary.     Some of my favorite authors include Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, so if you have any suggestions that capture that classic mystery vibe or are more traditional in their storytelling, I would love to hear them! Thanks!
__label__1 I've been dealing with POTS for a while now, and one of the most frustrating symptoms I experience is my racing heart at night. It seems to happen when I'm trying to wind down and go to sleep. My heart rate can spike to 120-130 bpm, and it makes it really hard to relax and fall asleep.     I've tried various strategies like deep breathing exercises, reducing caffeine intake, and even adjusting my sleeping position, but nothing seems to fully alleviate the issue. I often find myself lying awake, feeling anxious about my heart racing, which only makes it worse.     Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what have you found helpful in managing nighttime tachycardia? I'm open to any tips or suggestions that might help me get a better night's sleep!

__label__0 What could have caused this and do it affect the brewing??    Coffee still tasted rich bold and great which is what counts but if it could be better i want to learn.    I put fresh ground coffee in and leveled with my wdt for espresso to even out the grounds. I dont ever remember having this happen though.
__label__0 Hope this is the right place to ask this but I'm watching a true crime documentary on Netflix entitled "Dig Deeper."  After the police have a suspect that seems pretty guilty he *spoiler alert* kills himself and they comment that they have to call off the investigation because you cannot investigate a dead person in Germany. I was hoping someone had some context to this law.  Why is it a law?  What is its purpose?  What brought it about?  Pretty much anything as I have never heard of that law before.  Thanks in advance for any info!
__label__0 I don’t know if anyone cares but I just finished my second week of college without missing a single deadline. As I’m sure many of you can relate, virtual learning has been hard as fuck. My professors call on me all the time because they’re convinced I’m doing something I’m not supposed to/not paying attention. I am constantly rewinding my pre-recorded lectures because I keep forgetting to listen. I’m not really absorbing anything and am probably gonna struggle on finals and midterms. However, I managed to finish the first two weeks with no late assignments, forgotten tests, or missed classes. I’m taking 16 credit hours and have one class in person once a week, and I’ve spent this afternoon actually crying out of relief. I’m not sure how the rest of this semester is gonna go, but I’m just so incredibly thankful that it’s gone this well so far.
__label__1 As a game developer, I've been grappling with the decision of whether or not to include multilingual support in my upcoming game. On one hand, I want to make the game accessible to as many players as possible, but on the other hand, I have limited resources and time. This has led me to wonder: is it racist or even fascist to not include multilingual support in a game?    I understand that language can be a significant barrier for many players, and excluding certain languages might alienate potential audiences. However, I also recognize that not every game can feasibly support multiple languages, especially indie projects with tight budgets.     I’ve seen discussions around this topic where some argue that failing to provide multilingual support can perpetuate a form of elitism, as it may prioritize certain languages (often English) over others. This can be particularly problematic in regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds.     On the flip side, I’ve also encountered developers who feel that focusing on a single language allows them to create a more polished and cohesive experience. They argue that it’s not about exclusion but rather about making the best product they can with the resources available.    I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think that not including multilingual support is inherently problematic? How do you balance accessibility with the practical limitations of game development? Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0  I downloaded a game from a site (cant say it because it gets removed) but it downloads really slow. I downloaded Free Download Manager, set it up, and now its at 10% after 20 minutes. I'm wondering if anyone on this subreddit have a clue why its so slow :/
__label__0 Hi mods, Dont know if this post belongs here or on ADHD subreddit so will cross post.    Started Adderall XR 30 mg a year and a half ago. I was previously on anti depressants. I split my dose into 15 mg in the morning and 15 mg at 2 pm. I felt quite well and didn't feel the need for an anti-depressant. I've always tried to reduce the medications I take so I told the doctors I would not need the anti-depressant. However, I am feeling the depression since a couple of months. My head is heavy. Initially I blamed it on the Lannett generic which is the most horrible generic. However, it has persisted on the brand name adderall. Is this typical?    Also, I'm totally non-functional without Adderall now. God save me if I ever have to go without it.
__label__0 For context, the UK parliament is trying to past a 'UK bill of rights' due to Brexit but it's going to be put through parliament without anything regarding abortion rights. The reason this makes me nervous is this sounds like that may be setting up a situation similar to what happened in the US regarding Roe V. Wade.    That is 'because abortion rights are not mentioned IN the UK bill of rights then abortion rights are not protected BY the UK bill of rights' and considering that abortion is technically still a crime in the UK under OAPA the fact that the government deliberately omitted this from the bill of rights seems like a setup to me.    (As a side note, women are STILL charged under this act to this day if it's believed that they obtained a abortion outside of the parameters laid out in The 1967 Abortion Act so the threat is real)    They were also a number of MPs (all white male Tories obviously) posting about how the overturning of RvW as a good thing and these very MPs may well become ministers in September when the new PM is elected. Put all this together and Dominic Raab's comment about abortion rights in the UK being a 'settled' issue doesn't nothing to ease the feeling that the UK may suffer the same fate as the US has.    I don't really know where I was going with this rant other than to bring people's attention to it, I was going to vent about the misogynistic pig that suggested that women should have to pay for the right to our own bodily autonomy in the form of a 'childless tax' but I thought this was far more important.    Stay safe and stay strong, if you live in the UK please contact your MP regardless of their party and tell them to pressure the government into adding abortion rights to the UK bill of rights as well as voting against the bill if it doesn't protect abortion rights.
__label__0 Hi y’all,    I agreed to go to this expensive dinner with my friends tomorrow, and I’m trying to find an excuse not to go since it’s not something I want to spend that much money on.

__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’m in a tough situation and could really use some advice. I’m a 27-year-old male, and I’ve decided to break up with my girlfriend, who is 25. After a lot of thought, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s best for both of us to part ways. However, I’m planning to do it through a letter instead of in person, and I’m feeling a bit conflicted about that.    The reason I’m choosing to write a letter is that I want to protect myself emotionally. In the past, when I’ve had difficult conversations face-to-face, it often leads to heated arguments or emotional outbursts, and I end up feeling worse than before. I think a letter will allow me to express my feelings clearly and give her the space to process everything without the immediate pressure of a conversation.    That said, I’m worried about how she will react. I want to be respectful and kind in my letter, but I also want to be firm about my decision. I don’t want to leave any room for misinterpretation or false hope.     Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? What should I include in the letter to make sure I’m being clear but also compassionate? Any advice on how to navigate this breakup would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

__label__1 So I was playing a normal game and I picked Katarina for my team. I was really excited to play her, but when I went to lock in my champion, I accidentally clicked on the wrong one and couldn't change it back! I thought it was a bug or something, but it seems like Riot has some restrictions on changing champions after a certain point in the pick phase.     Has anyone else experienced this? It’s so frustrating when you have your heart set on a champion and then you end up with someone you didn’t want to play. I really wanted to show off my skills with Kat!     Is there a way to avoid this in the future? Maybe I should just be more careful with my clicks? Or is there a way to report this as a bug? Let me know your thoughts!
__label__1 I (28M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for about two years. Recently, she decided to go on a solo holiday to recharge and spend some time by herself, which I completely supported. I thought it would be a great opportunity for her to relax and enjoy her own company.    However, since she left, she has been pretty much ignoring me. At first, I understood that she might be busy exploring and having fun, but it’s been over a week now, and I’ve barely heard from her. I’ve sent a few texts just checking in, but they’ve gone unanswered. I even tried calling her, but she didn’t pick up.    I’m starting to feel really anxious and confused. I don’t know if something happened while she was away or if she’s just enjoying her time too much to think about me. I’ve tried to give her space, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off.     I’m worried that maybe she’s lost interest in the relationship or that I did something wrong, but I can’t think of anything specific. I just don’t know how to approach this situation. Should I wait for her to reach out, or should I try to contact her again? I really care about her and want to understand what’s going on. Any advice would be appreciated.

__label__1 I'm on the lookout for non-fiction books that have had a significant impact on your thinking or understanding of the world. I'm particularly interested in titles that challenge conventional wisdom, provide new perspectives, or offer practical insights that can be applied to everyday life.     For example, I recently read "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, and it completely changed the way I view human history and our place in the world. I also found "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman to be incredibly enlightening in terms of understanding decision-making processes.     If you have any recommendations that have made you feel smarter or shifted your perspective in a meaningful way, I would love to hear about them! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Hello, recently i have been playing around with doom on Dosbox, my only complain of it was the vertical mouse movement problem, luckily somebody had made a utility called novert which actually applied to the whole emulator, and not just the games. There is only one issue tho, when i used MBF (an old source port of doom made for dos) novert wouldn't apply, this was also happening to the boom source port too, does anybody know how to fix this?

Just wish every song got that treatment cause the ost is so good, but I know that’s asking a lot

__label__1 I've been dating for a while now, and I keep running into the same issue. It seems like every guy I meet is only interested in my body and not in getting to know me as a person. I try to put myself out there, share my interests, and engage in meaningful conversations, but it feels like they only see me as a physical object.     I recently went on a few dates with a guy who seemed really nice at first. We had some great conversations, and I thought we were connecting on a deeper level. But as soon as things started to get physical, he completely shifted his focus. He started making comments about my appearance and seemed more interested in physical intimacy than in building a genuine connection.     This has happened multiple times, and it's really starting to frustrate me. I want to be appreciated for who I am, not just how I look. I know I’m not alone in this, and I’m sure many women experience the same thing.     How do I navigate this situation? Should I be more upfront about my desire for a deeper connection? Or is there a way to filter out guys who are only interested in my body before I invest my time and emotions? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 It's interesting to think about how the motivations for war have shifted over time. In the past, leaders would often instigate conflicts to expand their territories or enrich their coffers. Nowadays, starting a war can lead to severe consequences, including loss of power, economic sanctions, and international isolation. It seems like the world is slowly moving towards a system where diplomacy and cooperation are valued more than brute force. Maybe this is a sign of progress, or perhaps just a reflection of the changing landscape of global politics.

As we gear up for the season, let’s dive into the latest news, player performances, and some exciting updates from training camp!    **Training Camp Highlights:**    The Canadiens kicked off their training camp this week, and the energy has been electric! Players are looking sharp, and the competition for roster spots is fierce. Notable performances include:  - **Nick Suzuki** has been leading the charge, showcasing his leadership skills and offensive prowess. He looks ready to take on the role of captain this season.  - **Cole Caufield** has been turning heads with his scoring ability, netting several goals during scrimmages. His chemistry with Suzuki is evident, and fans are excited to see what they can do together this season.  - **Kirby Dach** has also been impressive, showing off his versatility and playmaking skills.

He’s definitely one to keep an eye on as he pushes for a spot on the roster.  - **Lane Hutson** has also been a standout among defensemen, showcasing his skating and puck-moving abilities.

__label__1 As we head into the new season, the question of whether the Lakers should keep their draft picks is a hot topic among fans. Here are a few points to consider:    1. **Future Building Blocks**: The Lakers are in a unique position where they have a mix of veteran talent and younger players. Keeping our picks could allow us to draft some promising young talent that can grow alongside LeBron and AD. This could be crucial for the team's long-term success, especially as we look to transition into a new era once LeBron retires.    2. **Trade Value**: On the flip side, our picks could be valuable trade assets. If a star player becomes available, having those picks could help us land a significant upgrade. However, we need to be cautious about trading away future assets, especially if we’re not guaranteed to get a superstar in return.    3. **Current Roster Needs**: With the current roster, we have some gaps that need to be filled, particularly in terms of depth and shooting. If the front office believes that a trade can help us contend immediately, it might make sense to move the picks. But we also have to consider the risk of trading away future potential for a short-term gain.    4. **Development of Young Players**: If we keep our picks, we can focus on developing young talent like Max Christie and others. This could provide us with a solid foundation for the future, especially if we can find players who fit well with our core.    5. **Fan Sentiment**: The Lakers have a passionate fan base that values the history and tradition of the franchise. Keeping our picks and building through the draft could resonate well with fans who want to see the team develop homegrown talent rather than relying solely on trades and free agency.    In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I lean towards keeping the picks. The Lakers need to think about the future while also trying to remain competitive now. Balancing both aspects could be the key to sustained success. What do you all think? Should we hold onto our picks or look to trade them for immediate help?
__label__1 I've been playing Dragon Ball Legends for a while now, and I've been wondering if it's worth investing in anything below Sparking rarity. With so many powerful Sparking units available, it feels like the lower rarity characters just don't hold up in the current meta.     I've seen some players mention that certain Extreme or Hero units can still be useful in specific situations or team compositions, especially if they have unique abilities or synergies. For example, some of the older Extreme units can still provide decent support or fill a role in a themed team.     However, I find it hard to justify spending resources on them when I could be focusing on leveling up my Sparking units. What do you all think? Are there any non-Sparking characters that you believe are worth upgrading? Or should we just stick to the Sparking units and save our resources for them? Let's discuss!
__label__1 It's like the universe is testing my willpower! Just as I finally get back into my fitness routine and start eating clean, I get bombarded with all these food promo offers. 🍕🍔    I mean, who can resist a buy-one-get-one-free pizza or a half-off burger deal? It feels like every restaurant is trying to lure me back into my old habits just when I'm feeling motivated and focused on my goals.     I know I need to stay strong and stick to my meal prep, but it's tough when those tempting ads pop up everywhere. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you stay on track when all these delicious distractions are around? Let's share some tips on how to resist those cravings and keep our fitness journeys on the right path!
__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with transferring my PS+ cloud saves to my new console. I thought it would be a straightforward process, but it seems like nothing is working.     I’ve made sure that my PS+ subscription is active and that I’ve uploaded my saves from my old console. However, when I go to download them on my new PS5, they just don’t appear. I’ve tried restarting the console, checking my internet connection, and even logging in and out of my account, but nothing seems to help.     Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips or solutions would be greatly appreciated! I really don’t want to lose my progress in my games.
__label__0 It's been a little over two months since I broke up. We came very close to marrying, but her father guilt-tripped her into not leaving her hometown. I was certain it was working out - we'd had long conversations and ironed out most issues (or so I'd thought - these mostly had to do with moving to Bangalore, her hometown, after a few years of living elsewhere. That seemed fine to me).    Two weeks after our last meeting (we live about 2,000 kilometers apart), she suddenly dropped a bomb on me, telling me her parents didn't want her to leave Bangalore, and that it would be unfair to 'force' me to move there. I was heartbroken.    I'm struggling to move on. I am trying to talk to other women, but cannot rid myself of my sadness, anger, and perhaps-irrational hope she might just return. It takes me hours to return messages that this other woman, to whom I'm talking these days, sends me - I'm just scared to commit to another relationship and potentially suffer another heartbreak.    I live alone in a small town, where I have no access to mental health services. I feel betrayed. I am able to keep my demons at bay while at work, but not at home, where I'm alone with my thoughts. My parents, though concerned and just as hurt at my ex's sudden U-turn, are unable to offer anything beyond sympathy and exhortations to "stop thinking about her and move on".    God, I need help. I understand I might not receive it on this subreddit, but I just wanted to get this off my chest.    TL;DR: Struggling to overcome a recent breakup and, as a result, commitment-phobic. Please read the entire thing, though - I've only added the TL;DR because this subreddit forces me to.
__label__1 I’m planning to visit Beirut soon and I’m on the lookout for some unique gift shops to explore. I want to find places that offer local crafts, traditional Lebanese items, or anything that captures the essence of the city.     Are there any specific shops or neighborhoods you would recommend? I’m particularly interested in handmade goods, art, and souvenirs that reflect Lebanese culture.     Also, if anyone has tips on what to look for or what to avoid, I’d love to hear them! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hey fellow Aggies! I'm a transfer student and I just found out that I was 2000th in line for the parking pass. Tomorrow at 8 AM, I'm going to register and I'm a bit overwhelmed trying to figure out which parking permit to get.     I’ve heard there are different types of permits depending on where you live and your class standing, but I’m not sure which one would be best for me. I live off-campus and I want to make sure I can park close to my classes.     Any advice on which permit to choose or tips on navigating the parking situation at A&M? I really appreciate any help! Thanks and Gig 'em!
__label__1 Starting out in running can be a tough pill to swallow. I remember my first few runs where I felt like I was dragging my feet through molasses. It’s disheartening to see others zoom past you, and it’s easy to get caught up in the comparison game.     I’ve been running for a few months now, and while I still have a long way to go, I’ve learned to appreciate the small victories. Whether it’s running a little further than last week or simply getting out the door when I don’t feel like it, every step counts.     I’ve also realized that everyone starts somewhere. The seasoned runners I admire were once in the same boat, struggling to find their rhythm. It’s all part of the journey.     If you’re just starting out and feeling down about your progress, remember that it’s okay to be a beginner. Celebrate your efforts, no matter how small, and focus on your own path rather than comparing yourself to others. We’re all in this together, and every runner has their own story. Keep pushing forward!
__label__1 The ASL (Ace, Sabo, Luffy) flashback arc primarily concludes in Episode 106 of the One Piece anime. This episode features the emotional reunion and farewell between Luffy and Sabo, as well as the pivotal moment when Ace sets off to become a pirate. The flashback provides crucial context for the characters' motivations and their bond, which plays a significant role in the overarching narrative of the series. If you're looking for the specific moment when the ASL storyline wraps up, Episode 106 is the one to watch!
__label__1 With the recent Ethereum merge, many DeFi projects are adapting to the new proof-of-stake model, and Yearn Finance is no exception. Their Curve stETH vault has been gaining attention as it allows users to earn yield on their staked ETH while maintaining liquidity through Curve's liquidity pools.    For those unfamiliar, the stETH token represents staked ETH on the Lido platform, which allows users to stake their ETH and receive stETH in return. This stETH can then be used in various DeFi protocols, including Yearn's vaults, to generate additional yield.    The Yearn Curve stETH vault specifically aims to optimize yield farming strategies by leveraging the liquidity provided by Curve's pools. This means that users can deposit their stETH into the Yearn vault, which will automatically manage the assets to maximize returns. The vault takes care of the complex strategies, allowing users to benefit from yield farming without needing to actively manage their positions.    One of the key advantages of using the Yearn Curve stETH vault is the ability to earn yield on staked ETH while still having access to liquidity. This is particularly important in the current market, where many investors are looking for ways to earn passive income on their assets without locking them up for extended periods.    However, as with any DeFi project, there are risks involved. Users should be aware of potential smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss when providing liquidity, and the overall volatility of the crypto market. It's crucial to do your own research and understand the mechanics of the vault before investing.    Overall, Yearn's Curve stETH vault is an exciting development in the DeFi space post-merge, providing a unique opportunity for ETH holders to earn yield while participating in the new proof-of-stake ecosystem. What are your thoughts on this vault? Have you tried it out yet?

__label__0 Hi all!    We've been so good with soft methods and supporting wake windows for our now 7.5 month old so we never needed to "formally sleep train" (altho I see it all as some sort of sleep training but you know what i mean plus she's such an easy baby), until....     Vacation with the in-laws for a few weeks who are very old school "baby will sleep when they sleep", see they're big now they don't need sleep!" and so on. It was just hell for me when we had such good rhythm and habits together and we had NONE of it. She was going to bed at 23.30 or maybe at 18.30 you never knew (11.30pm &amp; 6.30pm) and I just didn't want to fight so I let it go although I hated it so much.       But now she's consistently sleeping less (9hrs at night max, few hours max naps), when it used to be 10.5hrs+ at night, good naps, and always going to bed at about 19-19.30 (7-7.30pm) or a bit earlier (1hr max) but not much variation in the end. She's going to bed at 21 (9pm) at the earliest and I HATE it. We were also getting closer to two/three nap variation which was easy to manage so she would still go to bed consistently, but now it's always three (sometimes weird 20min naps which we never had before) and she has stayed up for 6 SIX hours in the evening these past 4 days.     What is happening honestly?! What can I do?? Is it also the 3-2 nap transition and just. Help meeeee.     Thank you very much for all your help, I really need it....!!

__label__1 I’m trying to remember the name of a B-movie I watched a while back, probably in the early 2000s. It was an action/horror film that featured these lizardmen or fishmen type creatures that were attacking people in a city. The monsters had a very cheesy look to them, typical of low-budget films, and there were a lot of over-the-top action scenes.     I remember there being a group of humans trying to fight back against these creatures, and there were some scenes that were unintentionally funny due to the bad special effects. The setting was urban, and I think there was a lot of running around in alleys and buildings.     I can’t recall any specific actors or a plot twist, but I do remember it being one of those movies that you watch for the laughs rather than the scares. If anyone has any idea what this movie could be, I’d love to know! It’s been stuck in my head for ages.
__label__0 Seriously she’s a serial killer and a compulsive liar. Every time I marry her into my family people start dying and she can’t go a year without making up some nonsense about how someone insulted her.

Seriously send her to France if you can, she’ll have the court in uproar or her head on a pike within the year.

__label__1 I've been dealing with a situation for a long time now, and I really need some advice on how to handle it. I'm in my early twenties, and there's a woman in her fifties who has been insulting me since middle school. At first, I thought it was just typical bullying, but as the years have gone by, her comments have only gotten worse.    She often makes snide remarks about my appearance, my intelligence, and even my choices in life. I’ve tried to ignore her, but it’s hard when I see her regularly in my community. I’ve also confronted her a couple of times, asking her to stop, but she just laughs it off and continues with her insults.    I’ve talked to friends and family about it, and they all say I should just let it go and not let her get to me. But it’s really starting to affect my self-esteem and mental health. I feel like I’m constantly on edge whenever I know I might run into her.    I’m at a point where I want to stand up for myself, but I’m not sure how to do it without escalating the situation. I don’t want to make things worse, but I also don’t want to keep feeling this way. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I've been having some issues with my PS2 reading discs lately, and I was wondering if there are any alternative methods to clean the laser lens other than using isopropyl alcohol. I've heard that some people use things like vinegar or even window cleaner, but I'm not sure if those are safe or effective.     Has anyone had success with other cleaning solutions or methods? I want to avoid damaging the laser, so any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__0 Okay so I’m riding through Valentine near the auction yard, and I have a thought. If we get a ranch when we get properties, why not make the auction yard into a thing where we can buy and sell livestock?

Tell me what you think or how this idea could be improved upon
__label__0 Hello!     My pup had one back premolar removed almost two weeks ago. It seems we can still see one stitch that has yet to dissolve completely. I was just curious if anyone else has gone through this, how long did it take for their pups mouth to fully heal? I'm mostly worried about the stitching and possibility of infection. How long is too long for the stitch to fully dissolve?     We plan on continuing to feed him softened food for as long as it takes. It just makes me sad that he's not really allowed to play with toys. He loves those Hol-EE roller balls, would those be soft and safe enough to play with now that it's been two weeks?     Thank you for any info/advice for an always worried dog mom!! (He's 6 by the way and had a slab fractured that was the cause for removal)
__label__1 I'm looking for some creative ideas for a physics investigatory project for my class. I want to explore something that is both interesting and feasible to conduct with the resources I have. Here are a few ideas I've thought of:    1. **The Effect of Temperature on the Resistance of a Wire**: Investigate how the resistance of different materials changes with temperature. This could involve heating a wire and measuring its resistance at various temperatures.    2. **Solar Oven Efficiency**: Build a simple solar oven using cardboard and aluminum foil, and test how different designs affect its ability to cook food or heat water. This could tie into discussions about renewable energy.    3. **Pendulum Motion**: Explore how the length of a pendulum affects its period. You could create a simple pendulum and measure the time it takes to complete a certain number of swings at different lengths.    4. **Magnetic Levitation**: Investigate how magnets can be used to levitate objects. You could create a simple setup using magnets and test how different configurations affect the stability of the levitation.    5. **The Physics of Sound**: Experiment with different materials to see how they affect sound absorption. You could create a soundproof box and test how well different materials (like foam, cardboard, etc.) reduce sound.    6. **Projectile Motion**: Create a simple catapult and measure the distance a projectile travels at different launch angles. This could lead to discussions about the physics of motion and angles.    7. **Water Rocket Launch**: Design and build a water rocket and investigate how the amount of water and air pressure affects the height it reaches.    If anyone has additional suggestions or has worked on similar projects, I would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 As I approach my late twenties, I often find myself pondering the question of when one truly stops being considered 'young.' Is it a specific age, like 30, when society seems to shift its perception? Or is it more about life experiences and responsibilities?     I remember when I was a teenager, I thought anyone over 25 was practically ancient! But now, I see people in their thirties and forties who still seem vibrant and youthful.     For me, I think it’s less about age and more about mindset. Some people in their fifties have a youthful spirit, while others in their twenties can seem quite mature.     What do you all think? Is there a certain age when you feel you’re no longer considered 'young'? Or is it more about how you feel and live your life?

__label__1 I'm trying to track down an old YouTube video that I remember watching years ago, but I can't seem to find it anywhere.     The video was a compilation of funny animal moments, and it had a lot of clips featuring cats and dogs doing silly things. I specifically remember one part where a cat was trying to jump onto a shelf but ended up knocking over a bunch of items instead. There was also a clip of a dog that was really excited to see its owner after a long time apart, and it jumped all over them.     The video had a catchy background song, something upbeat and playful, and it was around 5-10 minutes long. I think it was uploaded in the early 2010s, but I'm not sure.     If anyone has any idea what this video might be or if you can help me find it, I would really appreciate it! Thanks!

__label__0 We are visiting for the weekend from Rhode Island. What are some types of food you would recommend that you really can’t get elsewhere? In RI we have a lot of Italian, seafood, Portuguese, and Spanish food so we are looking to avoid those while here. Looking for other types of international food  to try. We had Tibetan yesterday.
__label__1 I just wanted to see if this post goes through. I've been having issues with my account lately and I'm starting to think I might be shadowbanned. If anyone else has experienced this, I'd love to hear your stories and how you dealt with it. Let's see if this actually shows up!
__label__1 I'm looking for recommendations for a family law lawyer in Halifax. I need someone who is experienced and can provide guidance on custody and support issues. If anyone has had a positive experience with a lawyer or firm, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions. Also, any tips on what to look for when choosing a family lawyer would be helpful! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I get it, we all want to make sure our builds are optimized and running at peak performance. But can we please take a moment to step back from the endless cycle of bottleneck questions?     Every time I scroll through this subreddit, it seems like there’s a new post asking if their CPU will bottleneck their GPU or vice versa. While it’s important to consider compatibility and performance, the term "bottleneck" is often thrown around too casually.     Let’s remember that gaming and PC building are about enjoying the experience, not just numbers and benchmarks. Sure, if you’re running a high-end GPU with a low-end CPU, you might not be getting the most out of your hardware. But in many cases, as long as your components are within a reasonable range of each other, you’re still going to have a great time gaming.     Instead of fixating on whether or not you’re experiencing a bottleneck, focus on what you want to achieve with your build. Are you looking for high frame rates in AAA titles? Do you want to play at 1440p or 4K? Tailor your build to your gaming preferences and budget, and don’t stress too much about the theoretical performance limits.     Let’s keep the discussions here fun and informative! If you have specific performance goals or questions about your build, feel free to ask, but let’s try to move past the bottleneck obsession. Happy gaming, everyone!
__label__1 In Brandon Sanderson's epic novel "The Way of Kings," there is a powerful quote that resonates deeply with Stoic philosophy: "Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination."      This quote encapsulates the essence of living in the present moment and embracing the journey of life, rather than fixating solely on the end goals or outcomes. It reminds us that the trials and tribulations we face are integral to our growth and development.      In Stoicism, we are taught to focus on what we can control—our thoughts, actions, and responses—while accepting the things we cannot change. This quote aligns perfectly with that principle, encouraging us to find strength in our struggles and to appreciate the process of becoming who we are meant to be.      How do you interpret this quote in the context of Stoic teachings? What practices do you employ to stay focused on the journey rather than the destination?
__label__0 Hello everyone, I've been trying to assist my father in finding software to replace the defunct Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips he's been using for 7 years now. His job is to drive around to various different houses, take pictures of them (or tack on eviction/insurance notices,) and upload them to a database used by banks. He usually does upwards of 40 of these per-day.    Is there any software or website which could be used to replace MS S&amp;T? He needs the ability to import from spreadsheets, have the software optimize the routes for fuel efficiency, and (preferably) port it over to his IPhone.
__label__1 Absolutely! "Vincenzo" is a fantastic blend of dark comedy, action, and legal drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story follows Vincenzo Cassano, played by Song Joong-ki, who is a Korean-Italian lawyer and mafia consigliere. After returning to South Korea, he gets involved in a battle against a corrupt conglomerate while also trying to reclaim a stash of gold hidden in a building that is now occupied by a group of quirky tenants.    The character development is superb, especially the dynamic between Vincenzo and the female lead, Hong Cha-young, played by Jeon Yeo-been. Their chemistry is electric, and the supporting cast adds a lot of humor and heart to the series. The show balances intense moments with laugh-out-loud scenes, making it a unique watch.    If you enjoy a mix of action, clever plot twists, and a bit of romance, I highly recommend giving "Vincenzo" a try. Plus, the cinematography and soundtrack are top-notch! Let me know if you decide to watch it!
__label__0 I just got a guitar pedal and on the instructions it said that the power cable is not included so how am I supposed to use it?
__label__1 I'm trying to decide between getting an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 12, and I could use some advice from the community.     I know the iPhone 12 has a few upgrades like the A14 chip, OLED display, and 5G capability, but I'm wondering if those features are worth the extra cost compared to the iPhone 11.     For context, I mainly use my phone for social media, photography, and occasional gaming. I also want a phone that will last a few years without feeling outdated.     Has anyone made the switch from the 11 to the 12? Is the performance difference noticeable in everyday use? Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Anything I should know?
__label__0 A couple months ago, everyone was talking about how Brunson was one of Troy Weaver’s top targets. I get the Knicks are expected to make a big push and he could easily return to Dallas, but we have the most cap space, especially with a sign and trade for Ayton that could force us to give up Grant.    If Ivey is still on the board at 5 I would rather just draft him and spend elsewhere, but if not a starting lineup of Cade Brunson Bey Keegan Murray and Ayton would be amazing.    Thoughts?
__label__0 I was thinking of a weighted blanket, or something super thick and perhaps a blanket for her new born.
__label__0 I'm trying to recall a book I liked as a child and a young girl would hear her parents say things and she would imagine them as literal (not Amelia Bedelia though).    Some examples included her parents saying they would kiss and make up after a fight, and it showed an illustration of her parents putting makeup on.     Another example is that her dad told her to be careful at the beach because of the undertow and she the illustration showed giant toes under the water.    Another example was her dad mentioning a penthouse and she pictured a big house in the shape of a pen.     I believe the book kind of went on like that along with pictures of every phrase.    Edit: typos
__label__1 I’m looking for recommendations on the best food spots in Chicago! Whether it’s deep-dish pizza, hot dogs, or hidden gems that serve amazing international cuisine, I want to hear about it.     I’ve already tried Lou Malnati’s and Giordano’s for pizza, but I’m curious if there are any lesser-known places that locals swear by. Also, what’s the best place for a Chicago-style hot dog?     If you have any favorite brunch spots or dessert places, I’d love to hear those too! Let’s share our favorites and help each other discover the best eats in the city!
__label__0 Update: Thanks for all the responses.  I have hit my threshold of people I can respond to.  If that changes, I will re-post.    &amp;#x200B;    Wouldn’t mind another person to talk to that has some similar interests, continually likes to learn, and is around the mid-30s age range. I have people to talk to in my life, but I don’t get really meaningful responses. It’s mostly small talk or silence, and I can only stand so much of that. So, I have been pretty lonely lately.    Reddit DM or email only - would like to remain anonymous because I find that aspect kind of fun. Share as much as you are comfortable sharing.    I don’t care about your relationship status or gender. I’m looking for someone with similar interests that would like an extra person to talk to once week or so.    In full disclosure, I did this a couple years ago and wrote to a few people for about a year, but the conversations eventually fizzled out at varying points in time, which generally seems like the natural course for this type of thing, but it was still enjoyable.    &amp;#x200B;    A bit about me:    \-mid 30s, female, United States    \-work in business    \-mostly introverted because I have to be extroverted at work    \-outdoorsy stuff on the weekends    \-work and reading news and articles/internets/puzzles (e.g. crossword)/exercise (sometimes) during the weekdays    \-can be incredibly blunt at times    \-stuff I love that aren’t a big part of my life much these days but wished they were: strategy board games, escape rooms, real dogs, travel, pine-scented things    &amp;#x200B;    Sorry if you contact me and I don’t reply. No reply most likely means you didn’t really include any info about yourself, or you said something like “I almost fit none of your criteria, but let’s chat anyway.” We don’t have to be perfect matches because that would be boring, but we need a couple things in common.
__label__1 I just had the most amazing experience in Pokémon GO! I participated in my very first Yveltal raid today, and to my absolute shock, I caught a shiny Yveltal! 🎉 This is not only my first shiny legendary but also my first time battling Yveltal, so I’m over the moon right now.     I was a bit nervous going into the raid since I had heard that Yveltal can be tough, but I managed to gather a great team and we took it down without too much trouble. When it came time to catch it, I was just hoping for a regular one, but when I saw that shiny sparkles, I couldn't believe my eyes!     I know shiny legendaries are pretty rare, so I feel super lucky. Has anyone else had a similar experience with Yveltal or any other legendary? What’s your favorite shiny legendary?     Also, any tips on how to best utilize my new shiny Yveltal in battles? I’m still learning about the best movesets and strategies!
__label__1 I've been really curious about how different gacha games are perceived by players, especially since there are so many out there with varying mechanics, art styles, and monetization strategies. I thought it would be interesting to conduct a little survey to gather some insights from the community.     Here are a few questions to consider:  1. What gacha games are you currently playing, and what drew you to them?  2. How do you feel about the monetization practices in your favorite gacha games? Are they fair, or do they feel exploitative?  3. What aspects of a gacha game do you value the most? (e.g., story, character design, gameplay mechanics, community, etc.)  4. Have you ever quit a gacha game? If so, what were the reasons?  5. How important is the frequency of updates and new content to your enjoyment of a gacha game?    Feel free to answer any or all of these questions! I think it would be great to see a variety of perspectives and maybe even identify some trends in what players love or dislike about their gacha experiences. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been diving deep into the Borderlands universe lately and I wanted to share some of my favorite content creators who really bring the game to life!     1. **Moxsy** - His videos are always entertaining and informative.

__label__0 Will they be showcasing anything else or was the last show it and they’re just waiting for console release now? Is there anything to show off? Not gonna lie as a Xbox kid who moved to pc I’m having a hard time finding a reason to get the new Xbox. It feels like everything will be on pc eventually and I’d rather upgrade the pc if that’s how it is. Just wondering if Xbox has anything else to present?
__label__0 I have several small teak wood dice trays I just completed but they still need a finish. I'm assuming that for a wipe on poly finish I would need to run it down with acetone first since the wood is so oilu, correct? Is there another finish that would work without needing the acetone wipe down? Would a simple danish oil or beeswax/orange oil finish be fine? (Both things I have on hand already)

__label__1 I've been diving into the world of high-speed data transfer and I'm curious about the potential of USB 4.0. I know that USB 4.0 can theoretically reach speeds of up to 40 Gbps, which is impressive, but I'm wondering if there are any PCIe 4.0 x16 expansion cards that can allow me to connect USB 4.0 devices directly to my motherboard.     Are there any specific models or brands that you all would recommend? Also, how does the performance of USB 4.0 compare to using a standard PCIe 4.0 x16 connection for things like external SSDs or high-speed peripherals?     I'm looking to future-proof my setup and make the most out of the latest technology, so any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 5 days post break up. I was out in a bar with my friends, I got a new outfit not to impress him if I saw him or anyone else, just so I felt good. I was having a great time with my friends when their faces dropped, and they turned to look at me. "Dont panic, but he's just walked in." He started walking towards our table, smiling. I was going weak because I thought he was coming over, instead he walked over to a table of 2 girls, one whom he has been with before. I can't describe how that felt. Really.
__label__0 I’m 22(m) and couple of days ago I had a massive fight with my mom. My mom had a very difficult marriage with my abusive and alcoholic dad. The one thing that kept her living was me and my brother. She has suffered a lot in her past and fought so many battles all by herself to help us get where we are today. I love her so much because what she is done for us and my only goal is to make her proud.Long story short I was in Canada for 4 years in college and my girlfriend from high school and I were doing it long distance for 4 years. I got back to India 2 months ago and we only went out a few times. Given that this is India and you can’t do things like in western countries and her parents didn’t know about our relationship. She got a job further away and she moved. So I wanted to go stay with her for a couple days before I leave for Canada again. And my mom disapproved saying that’s not appropriate ( understandable given the circumstances she was brought up on) but I disagreed and said I’m going anyways. She is been always very good friend to me and very supportive about the relationship. One thing led to another and I said some harsh words which made her so sad. She hasn’t been talking to me since. Now I think about it I could have handle the situation very differently but it’s in the past and I can’t do anything about it. I can see she is so hurt and that makes me so sad. I said sorry but it’s not gonna resolve any of this. I’m conflicted
__label__0 Pretty sure this is a Nickeldeon show from the 2000s or 2010s. Here's what I remember:    MC (a girl, maybe in her 20s or a teenager) walks into a fancy-ish restaurant. The waiter at the front of the restaurant brings her to a booth seat and she sits there. I think how the restaurant works is that you can have a date with random people who enter the restaurant. (It's weird, I know). So MC sees a hot guy enter and she tries to get his attention so he sits with her. He doesn't, because bros before hoes apparently. Hot guy hugs some other guy who was probably waiting for him and MC is sad. Then a Discord mod looking guy enters and he sits opposite of MC at the booth. They order a salad.     Here's the weird part that made me remember this. So the salad in front of the Discord mod guy and he brings out his nail clipper. This guy starts to clip his nails and all the nail clippings fall into the salad. MC is shocked. Then when he's done, he starts to eat the salad and the nail clippings.     That's basically all I remember. I was a little kid when watching this so it's probably a show like Victorious of Sam &amp; Cat but I really have no idea.

__label__1 I just stumbled upon this incredible playlist called "Pop Perfection" on Spotify, and I can't stop listening to it! 🎶 It's a perfect mix of current hits and some underrated gems that deserve way more love. The way it transitions from upbeat bangers to emotional ballads is just chef's kiss.     Some standout tracks for me include "Good 4 U" by Olivia Rodrigo, which still hits hard, and "Levitating" by Dua Lipa, which always gets me in a good mood. Plus, there are some hidden treasures from artists like Rina Sawayama and Tove Lo that I hadn't heard before.     If you're looking for something fresh to vibe to, I highly recommend checking it out! What are some of your favorite playlists right now? Let's share the pop love! 💖
__label__0 Where do I go for 4c yorion discord? I looked through the list and couldn’t find it but I could just be blind
__label__0 So, I’d like to start off with clarifying that I am a new player, having only started weekend before last, and I have not even completed the main story yet. I’ve mainly tried to get through BBI as fast as possible, and right now I’m trying to get Cursed Light to help me out. The thing is, I never get it. I’ve only gotten Purged Buckler. I even get different weapons whenever I’m a magic-based class, but never with fighter. I often save before changing me and my pawns vocations to fighter and warrior, but it’s always just purged buckler. What am I doing wrong?
__label__0 I was so pimi, that in grade 7, while living in Canada;, for the school science fair I hacked up there Evolution Creation book and pasted pages all over, and had articles poking holes in evolution on poster board, colorful diagram to bring it all home (a cut out from the book) - yes I was prepared to be blessed with studies, I had books to place, and had tie, nice shirt and dress pants - oh, didn't forget to have polished shoes! Jehovah for sure can see this!     I scoff at the kid next to me with his stupid volcano, that secretly I was impressed as it was damn cool working.     Some teachers walk by, and surely will take note that evolution is flawed - they will want to know more, but they walk by, most don't acknowledge me. I'm needing a blessing Jehovah - where are you!  The kids start walking through, my JW friends, come by, could use some encouragement - I call out their names as they walk by; instead they rush by. I see kids talking with them, pointing at me, laughing.    My display got no votes; but, what a stand I took! I couldn't have have done this display at the science fair without Jeh help to give me courage; wow I was blessed, I just wasn't hearing him! But he was there when I needed him! Jehovah blessed me!    I was bullied pretty bad, back in the 80's. I endured so much hate from school, teachers of course the other worldly kids; but also sometimes by some JW kids.    I turned out to be a decent guy, but how many didn't but you know I was giving it my all then, and for what. This religion damages folks.
__label__1 I’ve been feeling so lost and invisible lately. It’s like I’m just going through the motions of life, but no one really sees me. I often wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me, and I don’t want to keep dragging them down with my pain.     I try to reach out, but it feels like my words fall on deaf ears. I don’t want to keep pretending that everything is okay when it’s not. I’m tired of feeling this way, and I don’t know how to make it stop.     Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I were gone. Would anyone care? Would anyone miss me? I just want to feel like I matter to someone, but right now, it feels like I’m completely alone in this struggle.     I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want the pain to end.
__label__1 I've been experiencing a frustrating issue with the search function in Windows 11. It was working perfectly fine until a few days ago, but now when I try to use the search bar, it either doesn't respond at all or takes an eternity to return results. I've tried restarting my computer, but that didn't help.     I also checked for any pending Windows updates and made sure everything is up to date. I even ran the Windows Search Troubleshooter, but it didn't find any issues.     Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, what steps did you take to resolve it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just wanted to reach out to everyone who had their SAT canceled on August 29 and has been assigned a makeup date. I know how frustrating it can be to have your plans disrupted, especially when you’ve been preparing for this test for so long.     For those of you who have received your new test date, how are you feeling about it? Are you planning to change your study schedule or focus on different areas?     Also, if anyone has tips on how to stay motivated during this waiting period or strategies to maximize your prep time leading up to the makeup, please share! We’re all in this together, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.     Let’s support each other as we navigate this unexpected change!
__label__1 Overtuning parts have been a hot topic in the GBO2 community lately, and I wanted to share my thoughts on whether they're worth the investment.    First off, overtuning parts provide a percentage increase in damage based on the level of the Mobile Suit (MS) you’re using. For example, the Overtune (Ranged) part gives a 1% increase in ranged damage, with an additional 3% for each higher level of the MS, capping at a 10% increase. This can be a significant boost, especially for players who focus on ranged combat.    However, the effectiveness of overtuning parts really depends on your playstyle and the MS you’re using. If you frequently use high-level MS that can take full advantage of the overtuning bonuses, then they can definitely enhance your performance in battles. For instance, if you’re using a powerful ranged MS like the Kshatriya, the extra damage can help you secure more kills and contribute more effectively to your team.    On the flip side, if you’re using lower-level MS or if your playstyle leans more towards melee combat, the overtuning parts might not provide as much value. Additionally, the cost of acquiring these parts through supply drops can be steep, and you might end up with duplicates or parts that don’t fit your current loadout.    In conclusion, if you’re committed to a specific MS and want to maximize its potential, overtuning parts can be worth it. However, if you’re still experimenting with different suits or if you prefer a more balanced approach, it might be better to save your resources for other upgrades or parts. What do you all think? Have you found overtuning parts to be beneficial in your gameplay?

__label__0 so i’m still a bit new to my alters and am still trying to figure them out, but i’ve noticed that i have one who’s extremely draining. he always seems to be in a bad mood/on edge. i still live with my parents and it seems like he despises my (the host’s) dad, which is also draining. there are times where this alter is more calm but that’s not super often. how do i cope with being drained by him and with his negative behaviors/thoughts?
__label__0 Hi guys, I am thinking about getting a used Urza Mini 4k. It's heavy used and I can get it for about 650 Euros.   I'd like to use it for cinematic documentaries mostly.    Atm, I own a canon 90d, which I use on a gimbal for filming. I'd like to upgrade to get more dynamic range, log profile and an all in all better looking image.     What do you think? Is it worth buying? I'd need to buy some accessories for the Urza, like an ssd adapter etc. so additional cost about 250€
__label__1 As an entrepreneur, I often find inspiration in simple games and their underlying strategies. Recently, I revisited the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe and realized how it mirrors many aspects of business decision-making.    In Tic-Tac-Toe, each player must think several moves ahead, anticipating their opponent's strategy while also executing their own. This is similar to how we must navigate the competitive landscape in business. Here are a few lessons I gleaned from this simple game that can be applied to entrepreneurship:    1. **Anticipate Your Competitors**: Just like in Tic-Tac-Toe, where you must block your opponent from winning, in business, you need to be aware of your competitors' moves. Always keep an eye on what they are doing and be ready to pivot your strategy accordingly.    2. **Plan for Multiple Outcomes**: In the game, players must consider various scenarios based on their moves and their opponent's responses. Similarly, in business, it’s crucial to have contingency plans. What if your initial idea doesn’t work? What if a competitor launches a similar product? Having a plan B (and C) can save your business.    3. **Focus on the Basics**: Tic-Tac-Toe is a game of simple rules, yet mastering it requires practice and understanding of the fundamentals. In entrepreneurship, it’s essential to focus on the basics of your business—understanding your market, knowing your customers, and delivering value consistently.    4. **Learn from Mistakes**: Every game of Tic-Tac-Toe is a chance to learn. If you lose, you can analyze what went wrong and improve for next time. In business, failure is often a stepping stone to success. Embrace your mistakes, learn from them, and apply those lessons to future endeavors.    5. **Keep It Simple**: The beauty of Tic-Tac-Toe lies in its simplicity. As entrepreneurs, we can sometimes overcomplicate our strategies. Strive for clarity and simplicity in your business model and communication.     In conclusion, while Tic-Tac-Toe may seem like a child's game, the strategic thinking it requires can be a powerful metaphor for navigating the entrepreneurial landscape. What games or simple activities have you found to inspire your business strategies? Let's share our insights!
__label__0 So I realized I was trans long ago, and due to abuse at home, my transition was delayed until doctors decided I was safe enough to do so. I finally am in that position 10 years on, and I have nearly finished gamete storage. In 3 weeks, I start hormones. I am out to friends, some relatives, but not my direct family.    NFather has made openly homophobic comments in the past, and has a long history of trying to control how I feel/what I can think/how I live my life/what career I can have.    I completely expect a blow up. My mother knew for years and apparently disclosed this to him (according to her at least) but when I pressed my Father he told me she said I travelled 3 hours across the country (nearest Gender clinic is a long way away for me) for 'depression counselling.'    Either she lied to him or he is lying to me because he doesn't like reality. He has a long history of lying about what happens and rewriting it, such claiming assault is 'just normal brotherly shoving.'    I am not even going to bother telling him. He doesn't live near me right now (he's stuck abroad with the pandemic) and frankly I don't think I'll see much of him when he gets back.    My brother, the golden child, may tell him, but I have means to protect myself in the meantime.
__label__0 I’ve become exhausted and disillusioned by food. I am supposed to not eat gluten or dairy, and my 2 year old doesn’t like meat much. So many times it’s hard for her to just “have some of my food.” When I get around to trying a new recipe once every few weeks for the family, it doesn’t turn out as I hoped. I’ve been struggling with eating recently- most foods don’t taste good and I feel like I have to choke them down anyways. I get full quickly. Food and cooking is just such a struggle . It’s almost like I lost my appetite and taste buds.    So I would love any and all of your ideas on how to keep yourself and your meat-hating toddler fed! What are your favorite quick-cook recipes that are super tasty? Basics you always have stocked? Favorite freezer meals? Best sandwich condiments?

__label__1 I've noticed that when I left swipe on my own comments in the Apollo app, it doesn't seem to behave the same way as it does for comments made by others. For other users' comments, I can easily hide or report them, but when I try to do the same on my own comments, it feels a bit different.     Is this a feature or a bug? I would love to know if anyone else has experienced this and if there are any workarounds. It would be great to have consistent behavior across the app, especially when managing my own comments. Thanks!

__label__1 I've been considering attending a sheriff's sale in my area, but I'm a bit hesitant. I've heard mixed reviews about the quality of properties available and the overall experience.     For those who have gone to sheriff's sales, did you find any hidden gems? What was your experience like? Were the properties in decent condition, or did you end up with a lot of unexpected repairs?     Also, any tips on how to prepare for the sale? I want to make sure I do my due diligence before bidding. Thanks in advance for sharing your stories!
__label__1 So I just got a notification from Netflix about their new interactive movie, and it got me thinking... what if we could make our own interactive stock market experience? Imagine a world where you could choose your own investment path, like a choose-your-own-adventure book but for stocks.     You could pick between high-risk options like meme stocks (hello, GME and AMC) or go the safer route with blue chips. Each choice could lead to different outcomes based on real market data.     I mean, we already have options trading, but what if we could gamify it even more? You could have a leaderboard, rewards for making the best trades, and even penalties for holding onto losers too long.     I know it sounds crazy, but with the way retail investors are taking over the market, I think there's a real opportunity here. Plus, it would be a fun way to learn about investing without risking your hard-earned cash.     What do you guys think? Would you play an interactive stock market game? Or am I just dreaming? Let’s brainstorm some ideas!
__label__1 As a non-native English speaker, I often find that certain English words or expressions evoke completely different meanings or associations in my mind based on my native language or personal experiences. For example, the word "bark" in English makes me think of a tree's outer layer, but in my native language, it can also mean to "scream" or "shout". This duality can sometimes lead to confusion in conversations.    Another example is the phrase "break a leg". In English, it’s a way to wish someone good luck, especially in the performing arts. However, when I first heard it, I took it literally and thought it was a rather strange way to wish someone well!     I’m curious to hear from others: are there any English words or expressions that have completely different meanings or associations for you? How do these differences affect your understanding or use of the language?
__label__1 I’ve been playing WoW for years, and I’ve always appreciated the depth and complexity of the game. However, I’ve recently encountered some frustrating UI issues that are really testing my patience.     For some reason, certain UI elements seem to be randomly glued together. For example, my action bars overlap with my chat window, and my character’s health bar is partially obscured by the minimap. It’s not just a minor inconvenience; it’s affecting my gameplay experience. I find myself constantly adjusting the UI, only for it to revert back to its chaotic state after a relog or patch.     I know that Blizzard is always working on updates and improvements, but it feels like these little things are being overlooked. I want to be positive and enjoy the game, but it’s hard when the interface feels so jumbled. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with these UI frustrations? Any tips on customizing the interface to avoid these issues?     Let’s share our experiences and maybe we can find a way to make our gaming experience a little smoother!
__label__1 Hey everyone!    I’m looking to sell my Olight i3T flashlight, which has been a reliable companion in my EDC setup. This particular model is the limited edition Patin'd version, featuring a unique finish that gives it a distinct look.      **Condition:**    The flashlight is in excellent condition, having been carried but not heavily used. There are minimal signs of wear, and it functions perfectly. The light output is bright and consistent, and the battery life is still impressive.      **Features:**    - Dual-output: 5 lumens (low) and 180 lumens (high)    - Compact and lightweight design    - Powered by a single AAA battery    - Tail switch for easy one-handed operation      **Price:**    I’m asking for $25 shipped within the US.      Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want more pictures! Thanks for looking!
__label__1 I recently saw Hadestown for the second time, and I can't stop thinking about Orpheus' voice. The way he sings "Wait for Me" is just hauntingly beautiful. It really captures the essence of longing and hope, and I feel like it perfectly encapsulates his character's journey throughout the show.     I’m curious to hear what everyone else thinks about Orpheus’ portrayal in the musical. Do you think his voice is a reflection of his character's emotional state? I also love how the music in Hadestown blends different genres, and Orpheus' songs have this ethereal quality that really sets him apart from the other characters.     For those who have seen it, how did you feel about the actor who played Orpheus? I thought he brought such a unique interpretation to the role. And for those who haven't seen it yet, what are your expectations for his character based on the music and story?     Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I just wanted to reach out and share what I've been going through lately. The college admissions process has been really overwhelming for me, and I think it's triggering my OCD in a way that I didn't expect.     I find myself constantly checking my application status, obsessing over every little detail of my essays, and worrying about how my grades and test scores will be perceived. It's like I can't turn my brain off, and it's affecting my mental health and daily life.     I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, and I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced similar feelings during this process. How did you cope with the stress and anxiety? Did you find any strategies that helped you manage your OCD symptoms while navigating college applications?     Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
__label__0 Everything is geared towards females and the CDC says there is no approved testing for men. The first question I'll need to answer is whether or not there is a cancer risk for men since I have strain 16. I'm just so confused. Can somebody help water it down? Im overwhelmed and I need information I can comprehend.
__label__1 I've been diving deep into the world of Ayahuasca and its extraction methods, and I wanted to share some thoughts and gather insights from the community.     From what I understand, Ayahuasca is a brew made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the Psychotria viridis leaf, which contains DMT. The traditional preparation involves boiling these plants together, but I’ve been curious about whether you can extract the DMT from Ayahuasca using a nonpolar solvent, similar to how one might extract DMT from Mimosa hostilis or other DMT-containing plants.    In standard DMT extraction techniques, a nonpolar solvent is used to separate the DMT from the plant material after a basification step. However, with Ayahuasca, the presence of MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) in the caapi vine complicates things. The MAOIs prevent the DMT from being active when taken orally, but they also might affect the extraction process.    I’ve read mixed opinions on this. Some say that you can still extract DMT from Ayahuasca using a nonpolar solvent, but the yield might not be as high or effective due to the complex chemistry involved. Others suggest that the extraction might not be worth it, as the brew is meant to be consumed in its traditional form for the full experience.    Has anyone here attempted to extract DMT from Ayahuasca using nonpolar solvents? What were your results? Did you find it effective, or did you encounter any challenges? I’m eager to hear your experiences and insights on this topic!
__label__1 I just completed my first installation of Pi-hole, and everything seemed to go smoothly during the setup process. However, as soon as I finished and tried to access the internet, I lost connectivity completely.     I followed the installation guide closely, and I set my router to use the Pi-hole as the primary DNS server. I can still access the Pi-hole admin interface via its IP address, but none of my devices can connect to the internet.     I suspect it might be a DNS issue, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it effectively. I’ve tried rebooting both the Pi-hole and my router, but that didn’t help.     Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips on how to resolve the issue? I really want to get this working! Thanks in advance!

__label__0 Mandatory didn't happen today but i still cringe to this day when i think about it.  This happened around 12 years back when i visited USA for work. As a 22 year old coming from a South Asian country, i was naive and didn't have much idea about the tipping culture so prevalent in the USA. In my country, tipping is not encouraged and a few and far cases would be a restaurant not a cab for sure.  So one fine Monday morning, i took a cab to work in the lovely city of baton rouge . When i reached my destination, the fare was something like 25.35( made up figure).i paid him something like 30 bucks and waited for my change. He said he doesn't have exact change. I checked my purse but since it was my first day, i didn't have any coins on me. The cabby handed me 5 bucks back and muttered," looks like I'll end up tipping you". Ignorant me thought it was some kind of America humour, smiled, took my money and deboarded. I noticed that the cab guy had a weird half disappointed half annoyed look on his face when he took off.  It's only after many years that i realised how deep the tipping culture is. And dinggg... The entire conversation replayed in my mind and i realised what i did.. So dear cabbie, if you are reading this, I'm so sorry for ruining your day. I didn't know.    TL;DR - Didn't know about the tipping culture in the USA, ended up getting a tip from a cab for riding with him.
__label__1 So, I (25M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about a year now. Overall, our relationship has been great, and we have a lot of fun together. However, something happened recently that has really hurt my feelings and made me question things.    During a private moment, we were joking around, and I made a comment about my size, trying to be light-hearted about it. Instead of being supportive or reassuring, she laughed and made a joke about it, saying something like, "Well, I guess size does matter!" I know she didn’t mean to hurt me, but it stung.     I’ve always been a bit self-conscious about my size, and her reaction made me feel embarrassed and inadequate. I tried to brush it off at the moment, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like it’s affected my confidence, both in and out of the bedroom.     I want to talk to her about how her comment made me feel, but I’m worried it might lead to an awkward conversation or make her feel bad. I don’t want to come off as overly sensitive, but I also don’t want to ignore how I feel.     How should I approach this conversation? Should I bring it up directly, or is there a better way to handle it? I really care about her, and I want to make sure we can communicate openly about things like this.
__label__1 I've been looking for some cool Android games to dive into lately, and I thought I'd reach out to the community for recommendations. I'm into a variety of genres, so anything from action and adventure to puzzle and strategy would be great!     Here are a few games I've enjoyed recently:  1. **Genshin Impact** - An open-world action RPG with stunning graphics and a vast world to explore.  2. **Stardew Valley** - A relaxing farming simulator that lets you build your farm, raise animals, and interact with the townsfolk.  3. **Among Us** - A fun multiplayer game where you work together to complete tasks on a spaceship while trying to figure out who the impostor is.  4. **Monument Valley** - A beautifully designed puzzle game with mind-bending architecture and serene music.    What are some of your favorites? Any hidden gems I should check out? Thanks in advance!
__label__0 tl;dr: I travel a lot for work, and my wife does not think that calling her 5-6 times a day is enough. Additionally, I should not be doing anything fun/extra and all my extra time should be taken up with calling her.     My wife \[27f\] and I \[28m\] have been married for about 2 years and have a baby. I travel pretty often for work (every couple of weeks I am gone for about 3 weeks). While I am gone I am constantly texting her and calling her. I call her about 5 times a day and texting constantly. The other day me and my coworkers took an afternoon trip (a couple of hours) to do some sightseeing. My wife blew up saying that I would rather spend time with my coworkers than talk to her. She ended up telling me that while I am gone on these trips I am not allowed to do anything but work then go right back to my hotel where I should call her. Even breakfast and lunch which is normally eaten together with my coworkers, should be eaten alone in my car/room so that I can call her during this time. I was planning on doing something fun over the weekend (by myself mind you), but now all my plans are canceled and I am just sitting in my hotel room calling her. I am feeling so overburdened and controlled. I have tried to rationalize with her, but she just comes back at me saying that I need to stop arguing and just admit that I was in the wrong by not constantly being on the phone with her. I love her like crazy but fuck, I need my own space/time. She seems to have the attitude that if she cant do something fun, then I can't either. This happens constantly while I am gone and and I am getting pretty sick of it, but don't know how else to approach her about this. Any advice would be great.
__label__1 In my experience as a day trader, I've come to realize that while technical analysis and indicators are important, the real game-changer is mastering your mindset. Trading can be incredibly emotional, and it's easy to let fear and greed dictate your decisions.     I've seen traders with solid strategies fail because they couldn't stick to their plan during volatile market conditions. On the other hand, I've also seen less experienced traders succeed simply because they maintained discipline and a clear head.     Here are a few mental strategies that have helped me:  1. **Set Clear Goals**: Knowing what you want to achieve helps you stay focused and reduces impulsive decisions.  2. **Embrace Losses**: Accept that losses are part of the game. Instead of letting them derail you, use them as learning opportunities.  3. **Stay Detached**: Try to view your trades objectively. Don’t get emotionally attached to a position; it can cloud your judgment.  4. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques like meditation can help you stay calm and centered, especially during high-pressure trading sessions.  5. **Keep a Trading Journal**: Documenting your trades and the emotions behind them can provide valuable insights into your decision-making process.    What do you all think? Have you found that your mindset plays a crucial role in your trading success? Let's discuss!

__label__1 I've been diving deeper into the world of mushroom cultivation lately, and I have a question that’s been on my mind. Can you mix grains from different strains when preparing your substrate?     I’ve read a bit about how different strains can have varying growth rates and colonization times, and I’m curious if mixing them could lead to competition or if they could coexist peacefully.     For example, if I were to mix some rye grain from a fast colonizing strain with some brown rice from a slower one, would that be a recipe for disaster or could it actually work out?     I’m looking to experiment a bit, but I want to make sure I’m not setting myself up for failure. Any insights or experiences you all have had with mixing grains would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 When I first started as a DSP driver, I was a bit intimidated by the thought of handling heavy and bulky deliveries, especially since I was used to driving a smaller vehicle. However, I quickly learned that there are some key things to keep in mind that make the process easier and safer.    First off, training was definitely a part of the onboarding process. They provided us with some basic guidelines on how to handle larger packages, including proper lifting techniques to avoid injury. I also learned about the importance of using the right equipment, like dollies and hand trucks, which can make a huge difference when moving heavy items.    Driving a box truck was another adjustment. I had to get used to the size and handling of the vehicle, especially when it came to turning and parking. The training included some time behind the wheel, which helped me feel more comfortable. I also found that practicing in an empty parking lot helped me get a feel for the dimensions of the truck.    Overall, while it was a bit of a learning curve, I found that with the right training and practice, I became more confident in handling bulky deliveries. It’s all about taking your time, being cautious, and knowing your limits. Anyone else have tips or experiences with heavy deliveries? Would love to hear how you all manage!

__label__1 I recently encountered a frustrating issue with my AOC monitor's built-in speakers. They were working perfectly fine, but suddenly they vanished from the sound output list on my computer. I've tried a few troubleshooting steps, but nothing seems to work.     Here’s what I’ve done so far:  1. **Checked Connections**: I made sure that the monitor is properly connected to my PC via HDMI, as that’s how the audio is transmitted.  2. **Restarted Everything**: I rebooted both my monitor and my computer, hoping it would reset any glitches.  3. **Updated Drivers**: I checked for any updates for my audio drivers and the monitor’s firmware, but everything is up to date.  4. **Sound Settings**: I went into the sound settings on my PC to see if the monitor was just disabled, but it’s not listed at all.  5. **Different Ports**: I tried using different HDMI ports on the monitor and even switched cables, but still no luck.    Has anyone else experienced this issue with their AOC monitor? Any suggestions on how to get the speakers back in the sound output list? I’d appreciate any help or advice!

__label__1 I've been in a relationship with my partner for about a year now, and we recently started exploring the idea of polyamory. My partner identifies as polyamorous, while I identify as monogamous. We love each other deeply, but I find myself struggling with the idea of them dating others. I want to support their needs and desires, but I also feel a lot of anxiety about sharing them with someone else.    I’m reaching out to see if anyone here has experience in mono/poly relationships and can share some tips or insights. How do you navigate the feelings of jealousy and insecurity that can come up? What are some effective communication strategies that have worked for you?     I want to be open and supportive, but I also need to ensure that my own emotional needs are being met. How do you find that balance? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__0 Just got my Vancer Ice pad today and so far I've been really enjoying it. Only issue I'm really having with it is the edges not flattening out and the pad moving around slightly.    Would anyone happen to know a method to fix this? Would the Artisan water drop underneath trick work to make it stick to the desk more and help flatten it?
__label__0 I've been making my playthrough of Chains of Olympus lately and it occurred to me that the Persians have their own Mythology that they have exclusive to their lands. In Ascension we fight the Manticore, and the Elaphantaur which isn't a real mythological creature but does wear persian armor.     In chains of olympus when you defeat the Persian King you gain his ability to summon an Efreet which is a fire djinn from Arabic Mythology. It can be assumed that the Persian King gained the ability to do this himself during his conquering of the Persian empire which would have covered much of the Arabian territory.     Also in Chains of Olympus, we fight the Banshee, which comes from Irish Mythology.     So the idea of the Mythologies of other lands bleeding into others was a previously established concept. I just didn't really think of it critically until just now. I am so glad that future games seem to be exploring this further. I'd really love it if when/if kratos goes to egypt, he mentions having seen sphinx's before or if we end up going the celtic mythology route it would be cool to have kratos interrupt mimir as he explains what a banshee is.
__label__0 My last rig contained an ASUS  P8Z68-V motherboard which had a feature called LucidLogix Virtu, which toggled between the integrated graphics on the Sandy Bridge CPU and a separate GPU if needed.    I am not a big gamer and I just purchased a powerful card RTX 2080 Super.  It's really more than I need and it won't be getting much use.  My current system has an ASUS ROG Strix Z490-F Gaming board.  Is there way to use the onboard graphics when the video card is not needed- which is most of the time.  Seems to be a waste of power and additional heat, etc.
__label__1 As a lifelong Lakers fan, I've been following the team closely, and I genuinely believe that the Lakers are in a better position to contend than many of us think.     First off, let's talk about the roster. With LeBron James and Anthony Davis still leading the charge, we have two superstars who can take over games. Yes, there have been injuries, but if they can stay healthy, they can compete with anyone in the league. Plus, the addition of younger talent and role players has given us more depth than we've had in recent years. Players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura have shown they can step up in crucial moments, which is essential for a deep playoff run.    Secondly, the coaching staff has made significant strides. Darvin Ham has brought a fresh perspective and a defensive mindset that has improved our overall performance. The team seems to be more cohesive, and the chemistry is building, which is vital as we head into the playoffs.    Lastly, the Western Conference is as competitive as ever, but it’s also unpredictable. Teams like the Nuggets and Suns have their strengths, but they also have weaknesses that we can exploit. If we can secure a good playoff position, I believe we can make a deep run.    In conclusion, while there are challenges ahead, I think the Lakers have the pieces in place to surprise a lot of people this season. What do you all think? Are we underestimating our chances, or do you see potential pitfalls? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I finally did it. After months of contemplating, I deleted my Facebook account. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, but at the same time, I’m feeling a mix of relief and anxiety.     The decision came after my recent breakup. I found myself constantly scrolling through my ex’s profile, looking at pictures, and torturing myself with memories that I should be letting go of. It was unhealthy, and I knew it. I realized that every time I logged in, I was just reopening old wounds.     I also noticed how much time I was wasting on social media, comparing my life to others and feeling inadequate. I want to focus on my healing and rediscover who I am outside of a relationship.     I know it’s going to be tough at first. I’ll miss the connection with friends and family, but I’m hoping to replace that with real-life interactions. I want to invest my energy into things that truly matter and bring me joy.     Has anyone else taken the plunge and deleted their social media after a breakup? How did it go for you? Any tips on how to cope with the initial withdrawal?
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I hope you’re all doing well. I’ve been reflecting on how important it is to have a supportive network when it comes to staying productive and achieving our goals. I’ve noticed that having friends who share similar ambitions can really help keep me motivated and accountable.     I’m looking to connect with others who are also focused on productivity, whether it’s through studying, working on personal projects, or developing new skills. I believe that sharing our goals and progress can create a positive feedback loop that benefits everyone involved.     If you’re interested, I’d love to hear how you’ve found or built your own support networks. Do you have any tips for finding like-minded individuals? Have you used any platforms or communities that have helped you connect with others?     Let’s share our experiences and maybe even form some new connections! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year now, and she has been struggling with depression for most of that time. I care about her deeply and want to support her, but I’m finding it increasingly difficult to cope with her mood swings and the emotional weight that comes with her condition.    There are days when she’s really down, and it feels like I’m walking on eggshells. I try to be there for her, but sometimes it feels like nothing I say or do makes a difference. I often find myself feeling helpless and frustrated, which makes me feel guilty because I know she’s going through a tough time. I want to be her rock, but I also feel like I’m losing a bit of myself in the process.    I’ve suggested therapy, and she’s been open to the idea, but she hasn’t taken the steps to find a therapist yet. I understand that it’s a big step, and I don’t want to push her too hard, but I’m worried about her well-being and our relationship.     I also feel like I’m not equipped to handle everything on my own. I’ve been trying to educate myself about depression and how to support someone who is struggling, but it’s overwhelming at times. I’m starting to feel the emotional toll it’s taking on me, and I’m not sure how to balance being supportive while also taking care of my own mental health.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How do you support a partner with depression without losing yourself in the process? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 Just got back from an incredible night at ICW NHB and I had to share this moment! Here I am with two MEGA fans from Vermont, Shawn and Morgan! They were absolutely loving the violence and pageantry that ICW brings to the table. It's always amazing to see fans so passionate about the sport, and these two were no exception.     We talked about our favorite matches, the insane spots, and how ICW really knows how to deliver that hardcore experience. They even told me how they traveled all the way from Vermont just to catch the show! It’s moments like these that remind me why I love this business so much.     Shoutout to Shawn and Morgan for being such awesome fans! Can’t wait to see you both at the next event! Who else is planning to catch ICW NHB in the future?
__label__1 The debate surrounding Proof of Work (PoW) and Bitcoin (BTC) often centers on its merits and drawbacks. Here’s a breakdown of why PoW and Bitcoin can be seen as both "good" and "bad" in various contexts.    **The Good:**  1. **Security and Decentralization:** PoW is a robust consensus mechanism that secures the Bitcoin network. It requires significant computational power to validate transactions and create new blocks, making it extremely difficult for any single entity to control the network. This decentralization is a core principle of Bitcoin, ensuring that no one party can manipulate the system.    2. **Incentive Structure:** Miners are incentivized to contribute their computational resources through block rewards and transaction fees. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where participants are rewarded for maintaining the network's integrity.    3. **Proven Track Record:** Bitcoin has been operational since 2009 and has proven its resilience against attacks and failures. The PoW mechanism has successfully maintained the network's security and reliability over the years, establishing Bitcoin as a leading cryptocurrency.    4. **Energy as a Resource:** While PoW is often criticized for its energy consumption, proponents argue that it encourages the use of renewable energy sources. Many miners are increasingly turning to solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce costs and environmental impact.    **The Bad:**  1. **Environmental Concerns:** The energy consumption associated with PoW mining is substantial, leading to criticisms regarding its environmental impact. Critics argue that the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining is unsustainable and contributes to climate change.    2. **Centralization of Mining Power:** Over time, mining has become concentrated in regions with cheap electricity, leading to concerns about centralization. Large mining pools can exert significant influence over the network, potentially undermining the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin.    3. **Barrier to Entry:** The high costs associated with mining hardware and electricity can deter new participants from entering the space. This can lead to a situation where only those with substantial resources can effectively mine, further centralizing power within the network.    4. **Scalability Issues:** PoW can lead to slower transaction times and higher fees during periods of high demand. As the network grows, scalability becomes a pressing issue, and some argue that PoW may not be the best long-term solution for Bitcoin's transaction processing needs.    **Conclusion:**    The discussion around PoW and Bitcoin is complex, with valid points on both sides. While PoW provides security and decentralization, it also raises significant environmental and scalability concerns. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how these challenges are addressed and whether alternative consensus mechanisms gain traction. What are your thoughts on the future of PoW and Bitcoin? Do you think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks?

__label__1 I just watched the latest video where Ethan and Hila react to the Surströmming world record set by Sune on his mobility scooter, and I can't stop laughing! 🤣     Sune is an absolute legend for attempting to eat that fermented herring while zooming around on his scooter. The way he handled the smell was impressive, and the reactions from the people around him were priceless!     I love how Ethan and Hila were both horrified and fascinated at the same time. It’s like they were watching a train wreck in slow motion!     This video is a perfect example of why I love their content. They take the weirdest things and make them entertaining. Can't wait to see what they react to next!     What did you all think of Sune's record? Would you ever try Surströmming? 😂

__label__1 I've been diving back into Fallout 76 lately and I can't help but wonder about the future of single player content in the game. With the focus on multiplayer and events, it feels like the solo experience has taken a backseat.     Has there been any news or updates from Bethesda regarding plans to introduce more single player quests or storylines? I really enjoyed the Wastelanders update and the NPCs it brought, but I’m hoping for more depth in terms of solo play.     Are there any rumors or leaks floating around? Or maybe some community mods that enhance the single player experience? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__0 Hello all! Sorry I’m on mobile, please don’t post this anywhere else, sorry it’s so long, but it’s a rant!      Also open to name suggestions for my JNoMIL.       So, D(ear)H left his old job with his father shortly after I gave birth because his parents had too much control over him there and he was used as a chauffeur and constantly had to leave earlier and get home later than he should have(by hours), and his mom would always show up or call him at work etc.      My dad got him an awesome new job in DH’s field and he really loves what he does and finally doesn’t have major anxiety waking up for work every day. Win! Well, almost. DH decided not to tell his parents where he worked and gave them limited info on it so it would be hard to find.       DH applied to jobs before my dad recommended him for this one and he’s not technically inclined in the slightest. His mom has control over all of his old accounts and emails and constantly checks them so I set him up new ones of his own. She got into his email, set her phone number up as the number on the account, got into his ebay account, and used that to get into his paypal account. He gets paid through paypal. She then looked at his deposits and found his employers name, looked it up, and found the job site. Now its not at all a business front or a retailer, it is a little shop(as in like a big metal hanger garage-type shop) in a ROUGH part of town where they simply hand make the things that the company then wholesales to actual retailers. He got called in on Sunday which isn’t typically a work day for him. At around 3pm he gets a text from MIL saying “can you take a 5 minute break? I am outside of your car.” Now DH hand makes hundreds of complex items a day and has big orders with strict deadlines, and genuinely wants nothing to do with his mom at this point, so he replied “No I have 100 orders to fill I can’t,” and MIL loses it lol. She goes on about how “I didn’t think 5 minutes would kill you. I thought I was worth 5 minutes of your time. Now I know I’m not.” UGH. She left a bag of stuff on his car in a rough area. The bags contents? Gifts for our LO that she is not involved with whatsoever for obvious reasons if you read my previous post. The gifts were a tacky nightlight, which we actually just bought one we all really love. A shirt for DH. And a gendered onesie that says “kindhearted like dad,” which I’m 100% sure was just bought as a jab at me, because I’m the devil who keeps her BaBiEs away from her lol. The onesie is 2 sizes too small and also made for the opposite gender of what our LO is, which really doesn’t bother me at all and our LO wears plenty of neutral clothing, it’s just not something MIL would buy. I donated the nightlight and gave away the onesie. DH kept the shirt, I don’t monitor his relationship with his twisted parents, so why would I make him get rid of a stupid shirt he’s too embarrassed to wear?       Anyway, she sent him a request on paypal for $180??? We don’t owe her any money and it was random immediately after DH told her no. I think it was her way of clueing him in on how she found him. Then, of course, she left sooo many voicemails and texts about how she’s probably forbidden from giving LO gifts and how she knows DH is in a tough spot and she hopes she doesn’t get him in trouble with me by asking him to see her or getting these gifts for LO. LMAO. She then ignored his text telling her showing up to his work place isn’t okay and not to do it because he doesn’t want to get fired, but posted a photo on the book of faces that I took of her and DH soon after I found out I was pregnant. The caption was “I love you (dh’s name). You didn’t get to pick me for a mom, but I did get to pick you as my son, and I would never change that. I miss you terribly and hope to see you just to give you one more hug if nothing else.” LMAO. I died reading it, and died again typing it just now. I truly don’t understand how you can send your son into a panic attack showing up to his job he never told you much about, ignore his texts, but then make HIM seem like the bad guy on book of faces.       Also, yeah, of fucking course she’s forbidden from getting LO gifts. She put them in harms way and then punched me, their mother, in the fucking face. And put DH through a lifetime of hell. We don’t need her love-bombing so she can try to be a bookface grandma. She crossed too many lines and is a literal danger to herself and our family. She will sadly never be a grandma to our LO, but that’s on her.      Bonus story: upon hacking our email/ebay she completely ruined the surprise I had for DH’s birthday. I ordered him a few bike parts he was wanting that were hard to come by and she texted him to let him know our package would be delivered that day, AS IF I DIDN’T KNOW. He ended up getting them early and loved them, but I was so upset.
__label__1 The Gospel Canticles, also known as the "Songs of Mary and Zechariah," are a collection of hymns found in the Gospel of Luke (1:46-55, 1:68-79, and 2:29-32). These canticles are significant not only for their theological content but also for their rich historical and cultural context.     The first canticle, the Magnificat, is the song of Mary, expressing her joy and gratitude to God for choosing her to bear the Messiah. It draws heavily from the Old Testament, particularly the song of Hannah in 1 Samuel 2:1-10, which reflects themes of divine favor, social justice, and the reversal of fortunes. This connection to Hannah's song highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and emphasizes God's faithfulness to His people.    The second canticle, the Benedictus, is the song of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. It praises God for His redemption and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. The Benedictus is notable for its prophetic tone, as it speaks of the coming of the Messiah and the role of John in preparing the way. This canticle also reflects the Jewish tradition of blessing God, which was common in the prayers and liturgies of the time.    The third canticle, the Nunc Dimittis, is the song of Simeon, who, upon seeing the infant Jesus, proclaims that he can now die in peace, having witnessed the salvation of Israel. This canticle emphasizes the universal nature of salvation, as Simeon speaks of Jesus as a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Israel.    The origins of these canticles can be traced back to the early Christian community, where they likely served as hymns of praise and worship. They reflect the theological themes central to the Gospel of Luke, such as the fulfillment of God's promises, the importance of humility, and the inclusion of the marginalized. The use of these canticles in liturgical settings has continued throughout Christian history, making them integral to the worship practices of many denominations.    In summary, the Gospel Canticles are not only beautiful expressions of faith but also serve as a bridge between the Old and New Testaments, encapsulating the hopes and expectations of the Jewish people while heralding the arrival of the Messiah. Their origins lie in the rich tapestry of Jewish worship and the early Christian community's response to the transformative events surrounding the birth of Jesus.
__label__1 I recently came across some discussions about federal laws that specifically apply to military members, and I’m curious about the implications of these laws. For instance, I know that military personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which is quite different from civilian law.     What are some examples of federal laws that uniquely affect military members? How do these laws differ from civilian laws, and what are the potential consequences for military personnel who violate them? Additionally, are there any protections in place for military members that might not exist for civilians?     I’m particularly interested in understanding how these laws impact service members in terms of their rights and responsibilities, especially when it comes to issues like free speech, conduct, and legal representation. Any insights or resources would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I rarely if ever get catcalled, and honestly, I’m not sure how to feel about it. I see so many posts from women sharing their experiences with catcalling, and it seems like a common occurrence for many. I’ve read stories about women feeling uncomfortable, unsafe, or even violated by the attention they receive from men on the street.     But for me, it’s almost the opposite. I walk around my neighborhood, go to the grocery store, and run errands without ever experiencing that kind of unwanted attention. At first, I thought it was a blessing. I mean, who wants to deal with that kind of harassment? But then I started to wonder if there’s something about me that makes me invisible to that kind of behavior.     I’m not saying I want to be catcalled, but I can’t help but feel a little left out of the conversation. It’s like I’m missing a rite of passage that so many women go through. I’ve had friends tell me that it’s just part of being a woman in public spaces, and I can’t help but feel a bit disconnected from that experience.     Has anyone else felt this way? Do you think it’s better to be catcalled or to be ignored? I’m curious to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently started intermittent fasting and have been really enjoying the process. However, I had a bit of a dilemma this morning. I made myself a cup of dark coffee and added some flavored syrup to it. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now I’m wondering if that has affected my fasting state.    I know that plain black coffee is generally considered acceptable during fasting because it has minimal calories and won’t spike insulin levels. But with the flavored syrup, I’m not sure if I crossed a line. The syrup does have some calories and sugar, although it’s a sugar-free version.     Did I screw up my intermittent fasting by adding the flavored syrup? Should I be concerned about breaking my fast? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this! Thanks!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I recently purchased an LG G2 and have been enjoying it for the most part, but I've run into a frustrating issue. My TV seems to turn off by itself intermittently, and it's becoming quite annoying, especially when I'm in the middle of watching a movie or playing a game.    I've checked the power settings and made sure that the auto power off feature is disabled. I also tried unplugging it for a few minutes and plugging it back in, but the problem persists.     Has anyone else experienced this issue with their LG G2? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to fix it? I'm considering reaching out to LG support, but I wanted to see if anyone in the community has any tips or solutions first.    Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I just had the most heartwarming experience at work today! A customer came through the drive-thru for a drink remake, which can sometimes be a bit frustrating for both us and the customers. But when she got to the window, she surprised me by paying for the car behind her! Not only that, but she also left a tip. 🥺 It was such a sweet gesture and really made my day a little brighter. It’s moments like these that remind me why I love working at Starbucks. Have any of you had similar experiences that turned your day around?

__label__1 I wanted to share my first gaming experience in Mumbai, and I’d love to hear about yours too!     Growing up, I was always fascinated by video games but never had the chance to play them much. When I moved to Mumbai for college, I finally got the opportunity to dive into the gaming world. My first experience was at a local gaming cafe in Bandra. The atmosphere was electric, with people immersed in various games, from FIFA to Counter-Strike.     I remember being a bit nervous as I sat down at a computer, but the friendly staff helped me get set up. I decided to try my hand at Dota 2, a game I had heard so much about but never played. After a few initial losses, I started to get the hang of it, and the thrill of teamwork and strategy was exhilarating!     What made it even more special was the camaraderie among the players. Everyone was supportive, sharing tips and cheering each other on. I ended up spending hours there, and it felt like I had found a new community.     Since then, I’ve explored more games and even made some great friends through gaming. I’d love to hear about your first gaming experiences in Mumbai! Where did you play, what games did you start with, and how did it shape your love for gaming?

__label__1 During the coronavirus pandemic, I spent a lot of time adapting to the new normal. At first, it was a bit overwhelming with all the changes happening around us. I focused on staying safe and healthy, which meant following guidelines like wearing masks and practicing social distancing.    I also took the opportunity to dive into some hobbies that I had neglected. I started cooking more, experimenting with new recipes, and even tried my hand at baking bread, which became quite the trend during lockdown!     To stay connected with family and friends, I embraced technology. We had regular video calls, virtual game nights, and even celebrated birthdays over Zoom. It was a great way to maintain those connections despite being physically apart.    I also took some time to catch up on reading and binge-watching shows that I had been meaning to watch. It was a mix of productivity and relaxation, trying to find a balance during such a stressful time.    Overall, while it was a challenging period, it also allowed me to reflect on what’s important and appreciate the little things in life.

__label__1 My husband (30M) is a huge music fan and loves going to concerts. He’s also very environmentally conscious and has made a lot of lifestyle changes to reduce his carbon footprint. He rides his bike everywhere, avoids flying, and is always looking for ways to be more sustainable. I (28F) admire his commitment, but sometimes it feels like it comes at the expense of our relationship.    Last week, he bought a ticket to see one of his favorite bands. I was excited for him, but then he told me he was going alone because he didn’t want to drive and couldn’t find anyone else who was willing to bike to the venue. I was a bit taken aback because I thought it would be a fun date night for us. I love music too, and I would have happily gone with him, but he insisted that he wanted to experience it solo.    When he left for the concert, I felt a wave of jealousy wash over me. I couldn’t help but think about how much fun he would have without me, and I felt left out. I tried to shake it off, but I ended up texting him halfway through the concert, just to check in. He responded with a picture of him enjoying the show, and I felt even more envious.     When he got home, I couldn’t hide my feelings. I told him I was jealous that he went without me and that I felt like he prioritized his green lifestyle over spending time with me. He was surprised and said he didn’t mean to hurt my feelings; he just wanted to enjoy the concert in his own way. He also mentioned that he thought I would understand since I often encourage him to pursue his passions.    Now I feel guilty for being jealous and for possibly making him feel bad about his choices. I know he loves me and would never intentionally exclude me, but I can’t shake the feeling that I should have been there with him. AITA for being jealous that my super green husband went to a concert alone?
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the effects of cocaine on confidence. From my experience, it definitely seems to boost your self-esteem and make you feel invincible for a while. When I'm on it, I find myself more talkative, social, and willing to take risks that I normally wouldn't. It's like this sudden surge of energy and bravado takes over, and I feel like I can conquer the world.    But I also wonder if this confidence is just a facade. Once the high wears off, I often feel the opposite—anxiety, paranoia, and self-doubt creep in. It makes me question whether the confidence I felt was real or just a temporary illusion created by the drug.     How do you all feel about this? Do you think the confidence boost is worth the crash that follows? Or have you found healthier ways to build your self-esteem without relying on substances? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I recently came across a situation where a store owner used lethal force against a thief who was attempting to steal merchandise. This has raised a lot of questions for me regarding the legality of such actions.     From what I understand, the use of lethal force is generally only justified in self-defense situations where there is an imminent threat to one's life or serious bodily harm. However, I am curious about the specific laws that govern the use of force in a property crime context.     Is it legal for a store owner to use lethal force against a thief if there is no realistic threat to their life or health? Are there any specific laws or precedents that outline the circumstances under which a store owner can defend their property?     Additionally, what are the potential legal consequences for a store owner who uses lethal force in a situation where it may not be justified?     I appreciate any insights or references to relevant laws that could help clarify this issue.
__label__1 I wanted to share my experience with a brand that has provided me with some of the best quality blank black shirts I've ever owned. After trying out various options over the years, I finally settled on the Bella+Canvas 3001 Unisex Jersey Short Sleeve Tee.     These shirts are made from 100% combed and ring-spun cotton, which gives them a super soft feel and a great fit. They have a modern, retail fit that looks good on just about anyone, and the fabric is lightweight yet durable. I’ve worn these shirts for everything from casual outings to layering under jackets, and they hold up beautifully in the wash without fading or losing their shape.    I’ve had some of these shirts for over three years now, and they still look as good as new. The stitching is solid, and I’ve never had any issues with seams coming undone or fabric pilling. Plus, they come in a variety of sizes, which is a huge plus for anyone looking to stock up on basics.    If you’re looking for a reliable, high-quality blank black shirt that will last, I highly recommend checking out Bella+Canvas. They’re perfect for screen printing or just wearing as is. I’ve even started gifting them to friends because I know they’ll appreciate the quality as much as I do!

For those who have experience with both, is the SE worth the extra money? How does the performance of the Series 3 hold up in 2023? I mainly use my watch for fitness tracking, notifications, and the occasional app.     Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 What tense should I put the *what's more* idiom in here?    *My vacation was awful. The beach was overcrowded.* ***What's more/What was more***\*, the fun park was closed.\*
__label__0 As in 2007, bursting housing bubbles are going to cause another Great Financial Crisis - but this time around the central bankers have blown their wad with 14 years of "emergency measures." Trillions in fake "wealth" created by central bank funny money are going to be vaporized. Got silver?

__label__1 As a Swiftie, I often find myself reflecting on how Taylor's music has shaped my life and the lives of so many others. It's like karma in the best way possible—her lyrics resonate with our experiences, and in return, we support her through every album release, tour, and surprise drop.     I remember the first time I heard "All Too Well" and how it felt like she was telling my own story. The way she captures heartbreak, joy, and everything in between is truly magical. It's almost as if the universe rewards us for being loyal fans by giving us these incredible songs that feel like they were written just for us.     And let's not forget the community we've built! Being a Swiftie means having a family of people who understand the significance of every Easter egg and lyric. We celebrate each other's milestones, share theories, and scream about new music together.     So, here's to karma being a Swiftie! It's a beautiful cycle of love, support, and unforgettable music. What are some of your favorite moments or experiences as a Swiftie? Let's share our stories!
__label__0 So my ex and I broke up like 3 months ago.     When we were “dating” if you can even call it that we didn’t hang out much. Just a couple of times. She never made plans, got mad that we never hung out even though I made the plans that she was saying no to, etc, etc.     When we broke up it was her who did it. Good terms. I wasn’t thrilled but not really because of the romantic interest but mostly because it would be really awkward for us to even be friends in the future. Then she unadded me on Snapchat (our primary communication). And like 5 minutes later she added me back. She did that same thing like 2 more times that month. Then she finally unadded me for like a couple of weeks. I think she was baiting me. I waited a couple of weeks and added her back. It was kind of more of a friendly thing to me because we had been friends before dating. I always kinda just wanted to be friends but I eventually realized she was pretty much just trying to date. We snapped a ton and talked a bit. This was early august. We were probably going to get back together at that point.     And then my friend (or ex friend idk right now) started a rumor that I told everyone she sent me nudes. This isn’t true because it didn’t happen. Also we’re underage so like why would I say that. He said that because he has a constant fear of his gf leaving him. She is obsessed with drama and constantly dropping/picking up new friends. So she started telling this to people. The rest of my friends all sided with me and said it wasn’t true. He refused to back down. He asked people if it was true. Which is weird since it was the same people who were on my side of this whole thing. Anyways his gf was gonna tell my ex and I didn’t want to look like I was trying to get revenge or whatever so I decided to tell her (my ex). Turns out she had no idea and thanked me for telling her. She then went to the guy who started it. Idk what he/she said. Regardless she ended up blocking me on Snapchat. I asked my friend about it and he said stuff like “you should be thanking me” and “at least it’s all in the past now”. I would have kept pursuing it but there was a chance it would ruin our friend group because a couple of people wanted to stay friends with him over me. And so I just decided to cut my losses and leave it.     Then nothing happened until the start of September.  At this point I was over my ex. And then she started acting really weird. She would sporadically snap me from her friends phones whenever she was with them. I would catch her staring hard at me when she thought I wasn’t looking when I passed through halls. I caught her stealing glances at me when she thought I wasn’t looking. And at a football game she would ask stuff through her friends like “where are you”, “are you in (mutual friend’s) computer class?” Which I obviously wasn’t. Like we had been in school for weeks in really small classes. And now she keeps doing that occasionally.     To add to this last weekend we both were at a party and I drank WAY to much. Im 6’ and weight like 125 lbs. I mixed like every type of alcoholic drink and was struggling to walk up and down the stairs. So did everyone else tbh. And she was like fucking watching me the entire time from the couch. For some reason it scared me then. But like when she went to leave I saw her watching me through the fucking windows while I was walking up the stairs and also watching me through the door. Like what the hell.     And to wrap it all up here is the worst part. The night before the party (it was on saturday) there was one at my house. I got drunk. Felt fine. It hit really suddenly and I literally got lost in my own neighborhood. Not exactly lost but like I passed my street. And besides drunk texting my cousin, I drunk texted my ex. She hasn’t responded thank god. But it’s still weird. Anyways, I can’t tell what she wants? Is she trying to get me hooked in case she can’t find a date to homecoming in the next couple weeks? It’s just kinda intriguing. Like if she was trying to make me want her back it just made me lose the little interest I had left. A decent amount of people I know seem to think that she’s after me. Although a handful of them don’t know about the whole rumor thing that I wrote below because I’m trying to keep that on the down-low.     TLDR: ex is sending me weird signals. My friends and other people I know tell me things ranging from she hates you to go and date her. Idk what to do.     Edit: To anyone asking why we mainly talked on Snapchat it’s because we were talking on there before we dated and we never really stopped using it. We did text and stuff but it was mainly Snapchat.     Yes we are in high school.     As I have been told to do countless times, no I cannot unadd her friends. Idk if you know how Snapchat works or if you think they are worse than they are, they are wonderful people, tbh so is my ex to a certain extent. Also, blocking people makes you look like an asshole.    I was told today by a couple of like sorta friends of hers to ask her to homecoming. Pretty sure they are just trying to start drama. But I saw another couple of my actual friends talking to her and 2 other girls beforehand while she was staring right at me. Like for a solid 1-2 minutes. And she has like unadded me on a couple social media. It’s weird. I’m not even interested in her at this point. I’m more of just intrigued by what’s she’s getting at.
__label__1 Why hello there fellow teenager staying up late! 😄    I just wanted to check in and see what everyone is up to at this hour. I’m currently binge-watching a new series and trying to finish up some homework (procrastination at its finest, right?).     What about you guys? Are you working on school stuff, or just scrolling through TikTok? Any late-night snacks you recommend? I could really use some ideas to fuel my midnight adventures! 🍕🍫     Let’s chat! What’s on your mind?
__label__0 My team is trying to create a prescriptive tool that gives the users diagnosis on their HR data eg. your turnover rate is higher than your peer companies etc. A set of fixed diagnoses will then prescribe what HR initiative or action you can do to close the gap or improve the areas.     The flow is to pick the area you wanna look into eg. turnover, productivity, or engagement &gt; pick a list of sections or approaches under those areas eg. new hires, voluntary, high performers etc. &gt; the diagnosis page where a list (so far 3) of metrics are looked into. For each of these measures, I've written switch cases that compare the metrics against multiple benchmarks and only highlight the poor comparison to be shown on the card or visuals. It's basically a comment on a critical metric eg. your turnover rate has risen by 50% compared to last year's. &gt; each comment will direct you to a prescription page where it recommends a list of actions you can do eg. to increase your salary package, increase engagement activities etc.    My issue with this idea is how fixed it actually is cos you can only have a limited number of diagnoses per metric per page per area. And what if even after all those layers of switches, there is nothing worth noting? I imagine this is how game development works. You list all possible outcomes and create the scenes to cater to all of them.     My question is, what is the best way for me to approach this project? Should I list all the possible outcomes (actionable prescriptions) first? Is there a way I could use Python to build an algorithm? Or any use of Python at all? Has this been done before?
__label__1 I've been playing Cities: Skylines for a while now, and I've hit a major snag with my city's finances. I started off strong, but now I'm in the red and struggling to keep my city afloat. My population is growing, but so are my expenses.     I've tried raising taxes, but that just seems to make my citizens unhappy and leads to more abandoning. I've also cut back on services like police and fire departments, but that just leads to crime and fires, which makes things worse.     I’m currently at a point where I’m considering taking out loans, but I’m worried that will just lead to more debt in the long run.     Does anyone have tips on how to stabilize my economy? What are some effective strategies to increase income without driving my citizens away? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’m feeling really confused and hurt right now. My ex and I broke up about two months ago, and since then, it’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. At first, I thought we could stay friends, but I quickly realized that I needed to go no contact to heal. I told her this, and she seemed to understand, but then things took a strange turn.    She started blocking and unblocking me on social media. One minute, I’d see her posts and stories, and the next, I’d be blocked. It’s like she’s playing this game where she wants to keep me in her life but also wants to push me away. I don’t understand why she can’t just stick to one decision.     When she unblocks me, I feel this glimmer of hope that maybe she misses me, but then she blocks me again, and it feels like a punch to the gut. It’s so frustrating because I’m trying to move on, but her actions keep pulling me back into this emotional turmoil.     I’ve been focusing on myself and trying to heal, but this back-and-forth is making it so much harder. I just want to be free from this cycle. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with the confusion and hurt? I really need some advice on how to handle this situation.
__label__0 I’m in the market for a new pair of aligns, would you go dark olive or graphite grey? I have three pairs of all black, one in formation camo, and one in the newest diamond dye. Most of my tops are in neutral colours.    Also in the market for a define jacket but have been searching for a solid black hoodless in luxtreme but I’m convinced it will never exist 😓
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the current state of monthly comic book series and how so many of them seem to be written with the trade paperback in mind. It feels like a lot of stories are structured to be collected into a single volume, which can sometimes lead to pacing issues and a lack of immediate stakes in the individual issues.     But are there any series out there that feel like they are genuinely crafted for the monthly format? I miss the days when comics would leave you on a cliffhanger at the end of each issue, making you eagerly anticipate the next installment.     For example, I think of titles like "Daredevil" by Chip Zdarsky, which has had some arcs that feel very much like they are designed to be read month-to-month, with each issue building on the last in a way that keeps the tension high.     What are some of your favorite ongoing series that you feel are written for the monthly format? Do you think the trend of writing for the trade is a detriment to the medium, or do you enjoy the way stories are being told now? Let's discuss!
__label__1 I recently came across a discussion about how personal relationships can impact your entrepreneurial journey, and it got me thinking about the balance between personal desires and professional ambitions.     As entrepreneurs, we often pour our hearts and souls into our businesses, but what happens when personal feelings and desires start to interfere with our focus?     For instance, I’ve noticed that when I’m feeling particularly anxious or distracted by personal relationships, it can affect my productivity and decision-making. It’s a reminder that while passion is crucial in business, it’s equally important to manage our emotional well-being.     How do you all handle personal distractions while trying to grow your business? Do you have strategies to compartmentalize your personal life from your entrepreneurial endeavors? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!
__label__0 Is there an app that will open an existing midi file and then send that midi out? In the jungle of apps, I can’t seem to find this.     So for example, let’s say I have a midi file that I downloaded off of MuseScore and I want to send that midi to my hardware setup. (I have the camera connection kit and the converter)     Thanks :)
__label__1 I've been thinking about my closet full of items that I rarely use anymore, and I'm considering selling some of them to invest in cryptocurrency. I know that crypto can be quite volatile, but I'm also aware of the potential for significant gains.     Has anyone else done this? What items did you sell, and how did it go? I'm particularly interested in hearing about any experiences with selling collectibles, electronics, or even clothing.     Also, what platforms do you recommend for selling these items? I want to make sure I get a fair price and can easily convert the proceeds into crypto.     Lastly, do you think it's a good idea to invest in crypto with money from selling personal items, or should I be more cautious? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

__label__1 I can't believe the raw chapter just dropped! The tension is palpable, and I’m still processing everything that happened.     First off, can we talk about that insane cliffhanger? I mean, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! The way the characters are evolving is just mind-blowing. Eren's decisions are becoming more and more complex, and I can't help but feel a mix of admiration and dread for him.     Also, the art in this chapter is absolutely stunning! The fight scenes are so dynamic, and the expressions on the characters' faces really convey the gravity of the situation. I love how the artist captures the raw emotions of despair and determination.     And what about the revelations regarding the Titans? I feel like we’re finally getting some answers, but at the same time, it raises even more questions! I can’t wait to see how this all ties into the larger narrative.     Let’s discuss! What were your favorite moments? What theories do you have after reading this chapter? I’m dying to hear everyone’s thoughts!
__label__0 Is it specific to certain groups of people? ie: family is fine but strangers are not.   What is the feeling like for you when someone touches you? For example, an unexpected touch from someone you don’t know very well or at all even if the context is friendly.   I’m trying to get my employer to understand that my discomfort with physical contact will never go away. They are insisting we have to make  physical contact with customers (they are citing our job description) and that accommodations are not reasonable. I’m reaching out to HR because multiple managers have said I should reconsider my employment with them over this.

__label__1 I think it would be awesome to have Nat’s What I Reckon on the podcast! His unique blend of humor and cooking is something that really resonates with a lot of people. Plus, his no-nonsense approach to food and life is refreshing in a world full of overly polished content.     Imagine the conversations they could have about the food industry, the absurdity of some cooking shows, and maybe even some behind-the-scenes stories from his YouTube journey. Not to mention, it would be hilarious to see Ethan and Nat try to cook something together, or even just taste test some weird food combinations!     What do you guys think? Would you like to see Nat on the podcast? What questions would you want to ask him?
__label__1 I know sneaking into a school chemistry lab might not be the best idea, but if you're curious about some cool experiments you could theoretically do (with proper supervision and safety measures, of course), here are a few fun ideas:    1. **Elephant Toothpaste**: This classic experiment involves mixing hydrogen peroxide, dish soap, and yeast or potassium iodide. The reaction produces a large amount of foam that looks like toothpaste for an elephant! Just be careful with the hydrogen peroxide concentration and wear gloves.    2. **Color Changing Milk**: By adding food coloring to a plate of milk and then a drop of dish soap, you can create a beautiful swirling effect. The soap breaks the surface tension of the milk, causing the colors to move and mix in fascinating ways.    3. **DIY pH Indicator**: If you have access to red cabbage, you can create a natural pH indicator. Boil the cabbage in water, strain it, and use the resulting liquid to test the acidity or alkalinity of various household substances. It changes color depending on the pH level!    4. **Baking Soda and Vinegar Volcano**: This is a classic reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas. You can create a small volcano using baking soda and vinegar, and watch it bubble over. Just make sure to do this in a container to avoid a mess!    5. **Crystal Growing**: If you can find some sugar or salt, you can create a supersaturated solution and let it cool to grow crystals. This can take a few days, but it’s a great way to see crystallization in action.    Remember, safety first! Always wear appropriate safety gear, including goggles and gloves, and make sure you have permission to use the lab and its materials. It's always best to conduct experiments under the supervision of a teacher or lab technician.
__label__1 Hi everyone,    I’m feeling really frustrated and could use some support. I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS for a few years now, and my main struggle has been with irregular periods. Recently, my doctor prescribed Intisol, but I haven’t noticed any changes in my cycle. I’ve been taking it for a couple of months, and it feels like I’m running out of options.    I’ve tried various lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, but nothing seems to be helping. I’m not overweight, but I do struggle with other symptoms like acne and hair growth. I’m starting to feel hopeless about getting my periods back on track.    Has anyone else experienced this with Intisol or similar medications? What other treatments or strategies have worked for you? I’m open to any suggestions or experiences you can share. Thank you for your help!

__label__1 I (25F) recently had a falling out with my friend (26F) of several years. We’ve been through a lot together, and I always thought we had a solid friendship. However, she recently confronted me about how my behavior has been toxic and detrimental to her mental health. I was completely blindsided by this, as I never intended to hurt her and genuinely thought I was being supportive.    To give some context, I’ve always been the one to listen to her problems and offer advice when she needed it. I thought I was being a good friend by being there for her, but she told me that my advice often came off as dismissive or condescending. For example, when she would share her struggles, I would sometimes suggest solutions or ways to improve her situation, thinking I was helping. She said that instead of feeling supported, she felt like I was minimizing her feelings and experiences.    I also tend to be a bit of a planner and like to organize outings or activities, but she mentioned that I often pushed my ideas onto her without considering what she wanted to do. I thought I was being proactive and fun, but she felt overwhelmed and pressured by my enthusiasm.    After our conversation, I took some time to reflect on what she said. I can see how my intentions might not have matched the impact of my actions, but I never meant to be toxic. I’ve reached out to her to apologize and express my willingness to change, but she seems to need space right now.    I’m feeling really confused and hurt. I never thought of myself as a toxic person, and I’m struggling to understand how I could have been so blind to the effects of my behavior. AITA for unknowingly being in a friendship where I was apparently toxic? Should I have seen the signs earlier?
__label__0 Do these types of noises drive anyone else insane? I absolutely cannot tolerate the constant buzzing sound of appliances like the fridge, water dispenser, or whatever else makes noise in my apartment. Sometimes there’s a buzzing sound in my bathroom and I have no idea what causes it or exactly where the noise is coming from. Same with other parts of my apartment.     But these noises make me want to rip my hair out or rampage around my apartment and destroy anything that might responsible for causing that unbearable buzzing noise.     I’m so frustrated and feel like I’m going crazy, but I’m also wondering if my apartment just has shitty appliances. Is it the norm for there to be so much buzzing noises coming from household appliances/fans/vents?    Are the rest of you generally more tolerant of similar noises? Or also intolerant?    How do others cope with similar issues?

__label__1 With the recent developments in AEW, I've been wondering if Hangman Page might turn on the Dark Order. The tension has been building ever since he returned to the ring, and his relationship with the group has been a bit rocky.     The Dark Order has been a supportive faction for Hangman, especially during his struggles with self-doubt and his journey to reclaim the AEW World Championship. However, with the emergence of new rivalries and the potential for Hangman to pursue a more solo path, it seems like a turn could be on the horizon.     Could we see a scenario where Hangman feels that the Dark Order is holding him back, or perhaps he gets swayed by a new alliance? The storytelling in AEW has been top-notch, and a betrayal could lead to some compelling storylines moving forward.     What do you all think? Is a Hangman turn on the Dark Order inevitable, or do you believe he will remain loyal to them?     Let's discuss!
__label__0 I've been running a side quest in an isolated setting for some time now, and it's been going pretty well. I've got my monster hunting the players and it occasionally does some damage when they slip up and fail a stealth or perception check. But at some point I'm going to need to flip the switch from suspense to combat (after they destroy a certain magical totem) so they can finish it off for good.     So far I've had it just do claw attacks, some poison stuff, and give the players visions (wis saves) that make them turn on each other briefly or walk into traps. But I'm interested in some advice for a fully fleshed out boss fight that's more than just a bullet sponge with some druid spells. So how should I build this boss? What abilities, immunities, weaknesses, et cetera should it have? I've heard about lair actions, should I put any of those into the boss arena?    For additional context  - The monster is called The Blight (I even got art commissioned, which you can see here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R5J1k0v-hdaVUL3G2LC9VDJYqnVoAU-w)    - The background is that it's a kind of old god of sorrow that rebuilt itself by creating havok in an isolated community, feeding on their grief, and possessing someone to come back up to partial strength. I've based some of it's magic around spells that I can flavor as messing with memories and creating illusions.     - The setting is full of overgrown roots and branches, and the minions that the party has faced so far had stats from Needle Blights, Vine Blights, and a Scarecrow (all with lowered health for difficulty reasons)    - The party currently consists of a bard and a paladin, and an artificer alchemist npc. All level 6. However they're not great at combat, so I try and keep encounters from getting too frustrating when I can)    If I can clarify anything else in the comments I'll try.

__label__0 Hi all,        Was having dinner with friends from school last night and a topic came up that I’d never thought of before: how will our pet(s) deal with us being gone for school?        I have a cat, his name is Meatloaf, I’ve had him for 8 years now and he’s pretty much my shadow when I am home/in my room. Most nights he either sleeps in my room or with me. Now in a few short week I won’t have my lil bugger with me for the first time.         Really wish the school allows us to bring pets with us. Would probably enhanced the school experiences and vastly improved the mental health aspects.        I understand why the school doesn’t allowed pets but still bummed about it. Thank you for listening to my rants.

__label__1 I've been playing Plants vs. Zombies 1 again after a long break, and I'm stuck on the final level of Adventure mode! I keep getting overwhelmed by the zombies, especially the Gargantuars and the Balloon Zombies.     I've tried different plant combinations, but I can't seem to find a strategy that works. I usually go with Sunflowers, Peashooters, and Wall-nuts, but I feel like I need something more effective.     Does anyone have tips or a specific plant setup that helped them beat the last level? Also, any advice on how to manage my sun production better would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of complaints about SBMM (Skill-Based Matchmaking) in the Call of Duty community lately, and it got me thinking. It seems like every online game nowadays, whether it's a shooter, MOBA, or battle royale, has some form of SBMM in place. Yet, it feels like the COD community is the only one that consistently voices frustration over it.    In games like Apex Legends or Rainbow Six Siege, players have accepted SBMM as a necessary part of the experience. It helps to ensure that matches are competitive and that players are matched with others of similar skill levels. This can lead to more engaging gameplay and a better overall experience.     So why is it that in Call of Duty, it feels like there's a constant outcry against it? Is it because COD has traditionally been more casual and accessible? Or is it simply that players are frustrated when they find themselves matched against opponents who seem to have a significant skill advantage?     I think it’s worth discussing how SBMM impacts our enjoyment of the game. Do you think it enhances the experience by providing fairer matches, or does it detract from the fun by making it feel too competitive? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been browsing through the posts on this subreddit for a while now, and I've noticed a significant number of people expressing a desire to leave the US. It seems like a lot of the discussions revolve around dissatisfaction with various aspects of life in the States, whether it's political issues, healthcare, or the cost of living.     I’m curious if this is a long-standing trend or if it has become more pronounced recently. Are there specific events or changes in the socio-political landscape that have driven more people to consider leaving?     Additionally, I wonder if this trend is reflected in other countries as well. Are there similar subreddits where people from other nations express a desire to leave, or is it primarily a sentiment felt by those in the US?     I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this. Do you think the desire to leave the US is growing, or has it always been a common sentiment among certain groups?

__label__1 I've been thinking about which tower to focus on leveling up next in TDS. I currently have a few favorites, but I'm torn between the Sniper and the Minigunner.     The Sniper has that long-range advantage and can take out enemies from a distance, which is super helpful for those pesky fast ones. On the other hand, the Minigunner has a higher fire rate and can deal with groups of enemies effectively.     What do you all think? Which one do you prefer and why? Let's discuss!

__label__1 So, I just got my 2023 Wrangler a week ago, and I took it out for a little off-roading adventure this weekend. I was feeling pretty confident, but I ended up getting stuck in some mud. It was a bit embarrassing, but also kind of a rite of passage, right?     I was cruising along a trail when I hit a particularly muddy section. I thought I could power through it, but before I knew it, the tires were just spinning, and I was sinking deeper. I tried to rock it back and forth, but that just made it worse.     I ended up having to call a friend to come pull me out with a tow strap. It was a bit of a humbling experience, but I learned a lot about how to read the terrain and what my Wrangler can handle.     So, I’m curious, what was your first time getting stuck like? Any funny stories or lessons learned? I’d love to hear your experiences!
__label__1 I've been trying to master the Wake-Initiated Lucid Dreaming (WILD) technique for a while now, and I wanted to share some tips that have helped me, as well as ask for any additional advice from the community!    1. **Relaxation is Key**: Before attempting WILD, make sure you are in a relaxed state. I usually do some deep breathing exercises or meditate for about 10-15 minutes to calm my mind and body.    2. **Sleep Schedule**: I find that WILD works best when I wake up after about 4-6 hours of sleep. This way, I can go back to sleep while still being aware of my body falling asleep. Setting an alarm can help with this.    3. **Focus on Hypnagogic Imagery**: As I start to drift off, I pay attention to the images and sensations that arise. I try to visualize a scene or a place I want to be in my dream. This helps me transition into the dream state.    4. **Body Awareness**: I keep my body still and focus on the sensations of my body becoming heavier. Sometimes I feel vibrations or a sense of floating, which I know is a good sign that I'm entering the dream state.    5. **Mantras or Affirmations**: I repeat a mantra in my mind, like "I will realize I'm dreaming" or "I am dreaming now." This helps maintain my awareness as I drift off.    6. **Stay Calm**: If I start to feel the sleep paralysis or any strange sensations, I remind myself that it’s just part of the process and to stay calm. Panic can easily pull me out of the experience.    7. **Practice Visualization**: If I find myself in a dream, I try to visualize a specific scenario or location I want to explore. This helps me take control of the dream once I realize I'm dreaming.    8. **Keep a Dream Journal**: Recording my dreams helps me become more aware of my dream patterns and themes, which can aid in recognizing when I'm dreaming.    I’d love to hear any other tips or experiences you all have with WILD! What works for you? Any specific techniques that have helped you achieve success?
__label__0 Hi all, description as followed:     Age: 25  Sex: F  Ethnicity: European      Description of concern:  I have, for as long as I can remember, experienced musical hallucinations (ie when my brain sits idle, or when it's supposed to be focusing intently, I can hear very vividly audio in my ears, usually songs I know but sometimes just random jazz noodling). I didnt realize until very recently that this isnt something that everyone experiences and I'm unsure what to make of it. It has also been increasing in frequency in the past ~6 months.     I have also periodically experienced visual hallucinations since around 18 yo, such as shadows, people doing gory things, ect.. but these are usually when I'm exhausted or on high THC weed (I don't smoke anymore)     For reference, I have a family hx of schizophrenia. I know gender is in my favour but I also know my age is around the time you begin noticing symptoms. I dont have any delusions (that I know of) and am capable of working full time so I dont think I have psychosis. I know this is a long-standing problem but its concerning that its intensifying.     Is this something that I should bring up to my dr? Is there anything anyone can even do aside from me not taking drugs and getting a good night's rest? The auditory hallucinations can be annoying but they're not disturbing like the visuals are and I havent had a visual hallucination in a long time.
__label__0 With the CSA obviously rattling the GB members such that Lett had to talk about it in the recent broadcast, you would think that at least one of the GB members or even the helpers should start to have doubts. There are so many elders, circuit overseers and bethelites that have left because of CSA. You would think that at least one of the GB members would start to turn. One of them has to be questioning how could God be leading this organization.

__label__1 I've been dealing with tinnitus for a while now, and I've been trying to figure out what might have caused it. Recently, I started wondering if it could be related to my blood vessels.     I read somewhere that sometimes blood vessels can grow too close to the eardrums or even become more prominent, which might lead to pulsatile tinnitus or other types of ringing in the ears. Has anyone else experienced this or heard of it happening?     I’m curious if there are any tests or examinations that can confirm if this is the case. I’ve been to an ENT, but I didn’t get a clear answer on whether vascular issues could be a contributing factor to my tinnitus.     If anyone has insights or experiences related to this, I would really appreciate your input. Thanks!
__label__1 I've been playing Rocket League for a while now, and I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of rank problems. I started in Gold and made my way up to Platinum, but now it seems like every time I get close to Diamond, I hit a wall.     I’ve been trying to analyze my gameplay, but I keep running into the same issues. My positioning is off, I struggle with consistency in my aerials, and I often find myself getting caught out of position. I know I need to work on my rotations, but it feels like every time I try to improve one aspect of my game, another one falls apart.     I’ve also noticed that my teammates can be a bit unpredictable. One game, I’ll have a solid duo partner who communicates well, and the next, I’m stuck with someone who doesn’t rotate at all or goes for every ball. It’s frustrating because I feel like I can’t control the outcome of the game when my teammates are inconsistent.     I’ve tried watching tutorials and streams to pick up tips, but sometimes it feels overwhelming. I’m starting to wonder if I should just take a break and come back with a fresh mindset.     Has anyone else experienced this kind of rank struggle? What strategies did you use to break through your rank problems? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been dealing with a frustrating sleep issue lately where I almost fall asleep, but then I wake back up just moments later. It feels like I'm on the edge of sleep, and then something jolts me awake—sometimes it's a noise, but often it just seems to happen for no reason at all.     This cycle repeats itself multiple times each night, and it’s exhausting. I’ll lie there, my mind racing, trying to relax and let go, but every time I feel myself drifting off, I’m suddenly wide awake again. I’ve tried various techniques like deep breathing, meditation, and even some sleep aids, but nothing seems to help.     Has anyone else experienced this? What strategies have you found effective in breaking this cycle? I’m open to any suggestions or tips that might help me finally get a good night’s sleep.

__label__1 I understand that the Middle East is a diverse region with a rich history and a variety of cultures, but I find it difficult to respect certain aspects of it due to ongoing issues such as human rights violations, authoritarian regimes, and the treatment of women and minorities in some countries.     For instance, in countries like Saudi Arabia, women face significant restrictions on their rights, including driving bans and limited freedom of movement. Additionally, the political climate in places like Iran and Syria is often oppressive, with dissent being met with severe consequences. These issues make it hard for me to view the region as a whole with respect, especially when these practices seem to be justified by cultural or religious beliefs.    However, I recognize that there are many people in the Middle East who are fighting for change and advocating for human rights. There are also many cultures and traditions that deserve appreciation and respect. I am open to changing my view if someone can provide a perspective that highlights the positive aspects of the region or explains how the actions of certain governments do not reflect the values of the people living there.     So, CMV: I can't respect some of the Middle East.

__label__1 I recently came across a mention of a K-drama that I can't seem to remember the name of, and I'm hoping someone here can help me out!     From what I recall, it had a mix of romance and comedy, and it featured a strong female lead who was quite independent. There was also a male lead who had a bit of a mysterious background. I think it involved some sort of workplace setting, possibly in a fashion or beauty industry, but I'm not entirely sure.     I remember there were some really funny moments, but also some heartfelt scenes that made me tear up. I believe it aired within the last couple of years.     If anyone has any idea what drama I might be talking about, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hey everyone! Just wanted to share that I’m on Day 3 of my NoFap journey and feeling pretty good about it. I know it’s still early, but I can already feel some positive changes in my mindset.     The first couple of days were tough, especially with the urges hitting me hard. I found myself thinking about old habits and the comfort they used to bring. But I reminded myself of the reasons I started this journey: to regain control over my life, improve my focus, and build healthier relationships.     I’ve been keeping myself busy with work and picking up new hobbies. I started reading more and even picked up a new workout routine. It’s amazing how much time and energy I have when I’m not consumed by those urges.     I also joined a few online communities for support, and it’s been great to connect with others who are on the same path. It really helps to know that I’m not alone in this struggle.     I’m determined to keep pushing forward and not let any setbacks derail my progress. I know it’s a long journey, but I’m ready to face the challenges ahead.     To anyone else on this journey, keep going! Let’s support each other and stay strong. Here’s to more days of growth and self-improvement! 💪✨

__label__1 # TL;DR: I got spoiled on episode 1057 due to a random post in r/piratefolk, and it made me realize how careful we need to be with spoilers in the One Piece community.    So, I was casually browsing Reddit, and I stumbled upon a post in a subreddit I had never visited before, r/piratefolk. I thought it was just a general pirate-themed subreddit, but to my dismay, the post was discussing a major plot point from episode 1057 of One Piece. I had been trying to avoid spoilers for weeks, and this was a huge letdown.    It got me thinking about how interconnected the One Piece community is and how easy it is to accidentally spoil someone, especially with the anime and manga being so popular. I mean, we all know how passionate fans can be, and sometimes they just can't help but discuss the latest episodes or chapters, even in unrelated subreddits.    This experience has made me more cautious about where I browse online, especially when it comes to One Piece content. I think it’s important for us as fans to be mindful of spoilers and to use spoiler tags or warnings when discussing recent episodes or chapters, even in places where it might not seem necessary.     Has anyone else had a similar experience? How do you all handle spoilers in the One Piece community? Any tips for avoiding them while still enjoying the discussions?
__label__1 I recently noticed that my window sill has developed a persistent drip, especially when it rains. The sound of water dripping is not only annoying but also concerning as I worry about potential water damage. I’ve tried to check for any obvious leaks or gaps, but I can’t seem to find the source.     I’m wondering if anyone has experience with this issue and can offer advice on how to stop the drip. Should I be looking into resealing the window or perhaps replacing the weather stripping?     Alternatively, if the drip is unavoidable, I’m also considering soundproofing options to help muffle the sound. Has anyone successfully soundproofed a window or used any specific materials that worked well?     Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

I currently have a basic setup with a few hides, but I want to make sure the humid hide is just right. I’ve seen some people use moss, while others recommend using damp paper towels or coconut fiber. What do you all think is the best option?     Also, how often should I be replacing the substrate in the humid hide? I want to make sure it stays clean and doesn’t develop any mold or bacteria.     Any tips on maintaining the humidity levels would also be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 I think people should understand that there is not wrong with missing an opportunity. Especially keeping in mind all those who lost their life savings.(it is not all pink as they try to market it.) A lot of people buy and hodl instead of waiting and buying at a right time because they are too scared of missing an opportunity.     This definitely has to do with how bitcoin is marketed with those who sold their assets (like the owner of Binance) took the risk and got rich.     Guys time and life keeps on going when you are watching pretty much meaningless graphs.     Freak capitalism yeah but it is okay to be content with what you have sometimes and actually spend it to enjoy it rather than tipping it to whales. At the end of the day, the best thing bitcoin has proven to do is to make rich get richer.

__label__0 Am I the only one who doesn't upgrade cards to infinity split whatsoever?    1. It makes the card look worse. Instead of a unique and fitting background you get a blend and generic bright rainbow-y background, which doesn't fit the character or his artstyle. Further than that: all of the infinity splits look almost the same. So during a match it takes individuality away from your deck.     2. Getting a shiny card with an effect like this was cool when you could get it randomly from a pack of physical spiderman cards. It was random and super-rare, so even if it didn't look that good, you'd still be intrigued to see someones' shiny card. In MS getting a shiny card is no difficult task, so you can't really flex with you lucky or hard-earned infinity splits.    3. It makes your collection full of useless and too colorful cards. This just doesn't look as satisfying.

__label__1 Getting 100 in all stats in Destiny 2 can be a daunting task, but with the right approach, you can maximize your character's potential efficiently. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:    1. **Understand the Stats**: First, familiarize yourself with the stats that matter for your class. These include Mobility, Resilience, Recovery, Discipline, Intellect, and Strength. Each class benefits differently from these stats, so prioritize based on your playstyle.    2. **Choose the Right Gear**: Look for armor pieces that have high stat rolls. You can use the "Stat Focus" feature in the Season Pass to target specific stats when you are leveling up your gear. Additionally, consider using armor mods that enhance your desired stats.    3. **Use the Right Artifacts**: Artifacts can provide additional bonuses to your stats. Choose artifacts that complement your build and enhance your preferred stats. For example, if you want to boost your resilience, look for artifacts that provide bonuses to survivability.    4. **Masterwork Your Gear**: Masterworking your armor increases the stat rolls and can provide additional benefits. Focus on masterworking pieces that enhance your key stats. This will not only help you reach 100 in those stats but also improve your overall performance in-game.    5. **Engage in Activities**: Participate in various activities like Nightfalls, Raids, and Crucible matches to earn high-stat gear. The more you play, the more chances you have to get gear with the stats you need.    6. **Use the Right Mods**: Equip mods that enhance your stats. For example, if you want to increase your mobility, use mods that boost your sprint speed or jump height. This can help you reach your desired stats more quickly.    7. **Focus on Seasonal Content**: Each season brings new gear and mods. Make sure to engage with seasonal activities to earn the best gear available. This can significantly help in reaching your stat goals.    8. **Join a Clan**: Being part of a clan can provide you with additional rewards and opportunities to engage in activities that yield high-stat gear. Plus, you can get help from clanmates in grinding for gear.    9. **Be Patient**: Achieving 100 in all stats takes time and effort. Focus on one or two stats at a time and gradually work your way up. Don’t get discouraged if it takes longer than expected.    By following these tips and staying committed to your goal, you can efficiently work towards getting 100 in all stats. Good luck, Guardians!
__label__0     I need to stop bed sharing and night nursing. My daughter is 15m and nurses all night long and I can’t take it anymore. She does lots of flipping and rolling in her sleep and she really pulls on my nipples and I’m totally losing it. She started getting teeth at 12m so I think she’s always teething right now so that doesn’t help. Last night I refused to nurse her and we were up for 4 hours in the middle of the night. My husband works like 50+ hours a week so having him do night wakes is out of the question. She naps for 2/3 hours about 4 hours after waking and bedtime is 5 hours from nap. And if she isn’t dead asleep when I put her down she immediately starts screaming at the top of her lungs. I need her to sleep in her crib. I’m losing my mind please help!

__label__0 Pickett drove the team and got the big touchdown to start off the 4th quarter.    All the Claypool and Johnson drops, all the sleepytime Trubisky downs; really none of them mattered at that point.  A 10 point lead with only a quarter to go NEEDS TO EQUAL A WIN.    This defense has been getting gashed in the run game, Witherspoon and Wallace and somewhat Sutton are not getting it done when they need to on big 3rd downs. Not having a true #1 CB is killing us, not having a true #1 DT is killing us.    This defense became swiss cheese when it mattered the most and they were handed a 10 point lead with less than a quarter to play.
__label__0 I recently read Molly Gloss' 'the Jump Off Creek' and loved its depictions of frontier life, and now I'm hungering for more!  What I liked most were the descriptions of the day-to-day activities of homesteading--like building the goat pen or fixing up the cabin.  I don't know, I found it really soothing.      What it reminded me most of was the Little House books, with all its descriptions of making butter, smoking meat, doing laundry, installing floors, etc. etc.      Any recommendations for books that heavily feature the almost how-to, nitty-gritty of life in the wilderness?  I see My Antonia recommended here for this sort of thing, but it seemed to focus more on the people than the tasks--I'm looking for high-grade drudgery here!

__label__1 TestMe    I just wanted to see if this post goes through without any issues. I've been experiencing some strange behavior on my account lately, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been shadowbanned. My comments and posts seem to be getting little to no engagement, and I can't tell if it's just a lack of interest or something more.     If anyone else has had similar experiences or knows how to check if you're shadowbanned, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!
__label__0 Hey there
__label__1 I was never a shy person, but social anxiety crept up on me after I got this really bad haircut back in 7th grade in 2017. I remember walking into school that day, feeling somewhat confident, but then I got roasted by my classmates. The laughter and comments hit me hard, and it felt like my self-esteem took a nosedive.     Fast forward five years, and I still struggle with social anxiety. It’s frustrating because I used to be outgoing and enjoyed being around people. Now, I find myself overthinking every interaction, worrying about what others might think of me.     I’ve tried therapy in the past, but I’m not going back. I want to overcome this on my own. I’ve started to challenge myself by putting myself in social situations, even if it’s just small gatherings. I remind myself that everyone has their insecurities, and most people are too caught up in their own lives to judge me as harshly as I fear they do.     I guess I’m just sharing to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. How did you cope with social anxiety that stemmed from a specific event? Any tips on how to keep pushing through? Thanks for reading!

__label__1 I've been playing Overwatch 2 for a while now, and I've noticed that the game has a certain saturation filter that can sometimes make the colors look a bit off, especially in certain maps. I was wondering if anyone else feels the same way and if there are any settings or tweaks that can help reduce this saturation effect?     I love the vibrant art style of Overwatch, but sometimes it feels like the colors are too intense or washed out. Has anyone found a way to adjust the visual settings to make the game look more natural?     Also, if you have any tips on how to improve visibility without compromising the overall aesthetic, I’d love to hear them! Thanks!
__label__1 I'm trying to track down an old horror game that I played years ago, and it's been driving me crazy that I can't remember the name. Here are some details that I can recall:    - The game had a strong alien theme, with creepy extraterrestrial creatures.  - It was a first-person perspective game, and I remember feeling a lot of tension and fear while playing it.  - The graphics were somewhat retro, possibly from the late 90s or early 2000s.  - There were moments where you had to solve puzzles to progress, and I think there were some stealth elements involved where you had to avoid being seen by the aliens.  - I remember a specific scene where you had to navigate through a dark, abandoned spaceship or facility, which added to the horror atmosphere.    If anyone has any idea what this game might be, I would really appreciate your help! Thank you!
__label__1 It's funny how we can lose track of time during mundane tasks like cutting our nails or shaving. You start off thinking it will only take a minute, but suddenly, an hour has passed and you're left wondering where the time went. It's like these small, repetitive actions create a time warp, making us realize that even the simplest routines can consume our day without us even noticing.

__label__0 From my talk on wanting to know if Marinette can be found innocent in the Ladybug episode, I know people have been giving the same answer on how Marinette only got expelled because people were so naive, gullible and clueless. I know it's true, but I have been wanting to know if there was a way for Marinette to prove her innocence aside from the problem that the people around her are so naive, gullible and clueless.
__label__1 I recently had a mishap with my Corsair H100v2 cooler where one of the cables snapped. I’m not looking for tech support or a solution to fix it, but rather I’m curious about the engineering behind the cooler.     Specifically, I’m interested in how the cable management is designed for the pump and fans. It seems like the cables are quite thin and could be prone to snapping if not handled carefully.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? What are your thoughts on the durability of the cables used in the H100v2? Also, does anyone know if Corsair has made any design changes in their newer models that address this? I’d love to hear your insights!
__label__0 Hello,    I would like an approximate level of the PC's power through their level.    I could easily do it for the monsters by reverse engineering the GMG. For example, from level 1 to 20, the strike attack bonus and the AC increase by 29 while the saves increases by 26. This is expected as players can expect their strike attack bonus to increase by roughly 29 (19 from the levels, 4 from proficiency, 3 from runes, 3 from ability score). They can expect their AC to increase by the exact same amount (to keep AC and strike on par)      Similarly, the saving throws grow slower because both the proficiency and ability scores for saves can't expect to match the growth of "main attack", and this matches perfectly the spell attack bonus, which grows by only 25, which is a growth to be expected as their are no runes for spellcasters.    Anyways, this is a simple model that came from studying 15 pages of the GMG, and it applies to monsters (not players). I am confident there are nerds out there who have mapped things a lot more thoroughly. However, my Google-fu failed me, can someone point me toward a more thorough analysis?    Thanks!
__label__1 I was thinking about how much fun it would be to see Danny review the movie "The Room." It's such a cult classic with its infamous bad acting, nonsensical plot, and memorable quotes. I can just imagine Danny's commentary on Tommy Wiseau's performance and the bizarre love triangle. Plus, the movie has so many cringe-worthy moments that I think Danny would have a blast tearing it apart while also appreciating its unintentional humor. What do you all think? Any other suggestions for movies that would be great for Danny to review?
__label__1 I'm excited to announce that the Kickstarter for my old-school compatible adventure, "By the Light of the Whispering Flame," is now live! This adventure is designed for classic tabletop RPG systems and aims to capture the spirit of the old-school gaming experience while providing a fresh and engaging story for players.    In "By the Light of the Whispering Flame," players will explore a mysterious, ancient forest filled with strange creatures, hidden secrets, and a powerful artifact that has the potential to change the fate of the realm. The adventure is designed for characters of levels 1-5 and includes detailed maps, unique NPCs, and a variety of challenges that will test both the players' wits and their combat skills.    I've put a lot of love and effort into making this adventure not only compatible with systems like OSR and B/X but also easy to adapt for other old-school games. The goal is to create a product that feels nostalgic yet offers new experiences for both GMs and players alike.    If you're interested in supporting the project or just want to check it out, please visit the Kickstarter page. Any support, whether it's backing the project or sharing it with your gaming group, would be greatly appreciated! Let's bring this adventure to life together!    Thank you for your time, and I hope to see you at the table!     [Link to Kickstarter]      Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts! I'm looking forward to hearing from the community.
__label__0 Okay.     I went to this arcade and there was this rhythm game. The details are vague for me but it was roughly ten years ago. I have no idea where I was either. I want to say it was in a place like "Little Tokyo" or whatever.    From what I recall...    The machine was tall and white. It had a platform to stand on and a circle or dome thing above you. It reminded me of a giant hair dome thing at the hair dressers but super tall and it had sensors on the bottom.    There was a screen in front of you that would show the song you were playing.    You had to move your hands (maybe feet too) to the line or dots on the screen. I think sensors would set off from the top piece to trigger the perfect, good, and great. They typical rhythm game responses.    If there was a foot part, they might have been just buttons or just to stay you were on it. I don't recall using any feet 100%. I could be thinking of another game that used feet. So take that information lightly.    Good luck. I tried to look it up and all I could find was more recent ones. I think it was from Japan about ten years ago or so?    Thank you.
__label__0 After you take the decision to map the Western Frontier, an event pops up that lets you choose one of 3 characters in your country to lead the expedition, all of them either a general or an admiral. While they are on the expedition, they are considered "busy", meaning you can't mobilize them and they don't participate in any other events.    &gt;Aside: The Western Frontier event chain itself kinda sucks, honestly. Every so often you'll get a popup that lets you choose how the expedition goes, and most choices are between either stalling or a random chance to either "progress" or put the expedition in "peril". The expedition ends when either 8 progress points or 8 peril points have been attained, seemingly with a bias towards peril (at least one decision gets you both a progress and a peril point). It's not really possible to influence the success of the mission. What's more, sometimes when the event ticks, you don't even get a popup and a choice - you'll just gain a set amount of progress and peril points. Real big pain in the ass, there's a mission that involves either mapping the frontier or going to war with British Columbia (I don't remember what exactly the reward was), but it sucked enough to complete the mapping that I just decided to fight Canada and GB rather than do the event.    If you don't care to read that big wall of text, the important upshot is that the expedition can fail. Sometimes, when the expedition fails, *the character you sent on it remains busy*. I noticed this a little while after I gave up on the mission. I'd sent a general, it failed as usual, I said fuck it I'm not doing this again, and went on with my campaign. Some time later I went to war, and discovered I couldn't mobilize the guy. I had a suspicion it was connected to the mission chain but I couldn't say for sure.    Then, fast forward a few in-game decades, I've annexed all of Canada and puppeted most of South America. I'm not really doing much else, so I decide for the hell of it to try the expedition one more time. The original guy was obviously unavailable, so I chose someone else, and miracle of miracles, he actually succeeded! He comes back from the expedition... except he doesn't. The original guy, who'd been busy all this time, now 100+ years old, eating up 75 battalions I couldn't do anything with unless I hired more generals in his HQ to peel them off him, finally makes his return. And, being 100+ years old, immediately dies. And now the guy who *completed* the expedition is busy forever.    This doesn't always happen when you fail the expedition as far as I can tell, and it's not really "game breaking" (like I said, I'd made significant progress without that guy and his 75 battalions because having access to an entire continent makes America's economic potential totally busted), but it is pretty annoying to just lose access to one of your military leaders and a chunk of your troops forever. It's an annoying thing that can sometimes occur after an annoying event chain.
__label__1 I am currently divorced and pregnant, and I am trying to decide whether to keep my ex-husband's last name or revert to my maiden name for my child. I have a few questions regarding this situation:    1. **Legal Implications**: If I choose to use my ex-husband's last name for my child, will there be any legal implications or complications, especially if we have a contentious relationship?     2. **Changing the Name**: If I decide to use my maiden name, how do I go about officially changing my child's last name after they are born? Is there a process I need to follow?    3. **Future Considerations**: What are the potential pros and cons of each option? I want to make the best decision for my child and myself moving forward.    4. **State Laws**: I live in California, so are there specific state laws I should be aware of regarding naming a child after a divorce?    Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 In a recent article, Peter Daszak, a prominent figure in the field of infectious diseases, has been linked to controversial claims regarding Ukraine and its historical ties to Nazi elements. This narrative has been circulating in various media outlets, often without substantial evidence, and seems to be part of a broader agenda to discredit scientific research and public health initiatives.    The article suggests that Daszak's work with the EcoHealth Alliance and his involvement in the Wuhan lab research somehow connects him to Ukraine's political landscape, particularly in relation to extremist groups. However, this connection is tenuous at best and appears to be a deliberate attempt to conflate unrelated issues to create a sensational story.    It's crucial to approach such claims with skepticism and demand rigorous evidence before accepting them as fact. Misinformation can easily spread, especially when it involves complex geopolitical issues and public health. We must remain vigilant against narratives that seek to undermine legitimate scientific discourse and promote division based on unfounded allegations.     Let's focus on the facts and hold those spreading misinformation accountable. #FightingFakeNews #ScienceMatters #CriticalThinking
__label__1 I recently noticed that my laptop screen dims significantly when I’m playing games while it’s plugged in. This only happens during gaming sessions and not when I’m just browsing or using other applications. I’ve checked the power settings and made sure that the brightness is set to maximum, but it still dims.     I’m using a gaming laptop with an NVIDIA graphics card, and I’ve updated all my drivers to the latest version. I also checked the NVIDIA Control Panel to see if there are any settings that might be causing this, but I didn’t find anything that seemed relevant.     Is this a common issue? Could it be related to power management settings or something else? Any advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Hey everyone! I was thinking it might be fun to have some regular discussion threads where we can dive into various topics that matter to us as a community. Here are a few ideas I came up with:    1. **Cultural Heritage** - Discussing traditions, festivals, and practices that are unique to different regions of India.  2. **Social Issues** - A space to talk about pressing social issues like gender equality, caste discrimination, and environmental concerns.  3. **Food and Cuisine** - Sharing recipes, favorite dishes, and regional specialties.

What do you all think? Are there any other topics you’d like to add to the list? Let’s make this a vibrant space for discussion!
__label__0 Let me start off by saying the game has plenty of flaws.     Graphics are no where next gen.   Animations are a bit clunky.   Voice acting could be a bit better.     However, as a Dad of 3 kids kids and very little time to game, this game is perfect.     I’m only about 2 hours in so far and I can hand on heart say I’ve had a better experience with this game then my last 5 games I’ve pre ordered which were;    Deathproof   Cyberpunk 2077  Evil Dead  Alien Fireteam  Battlefield 2042    Car chases, explosions, amazing customisation, loads of guns and plenty more.     For me it’s the perfect pick up and play. I don’t have to worry about what skill tree I need. Don’t have to worry about complex RPG attributes.     I would say this is the game that has made me think I’ll never read another review again.

I apologize if this isn't the right place for this question, but I was curious about the heating practices in Serbia, especially during the winter months.

__label__0 I see people doing crazy combos and loops, yet I don’t even know how to do a so called ”simple” combo, could someone help me out or send me a video that could help me?
__label__1 I know this might ruffle some feathers, but I genuinely believe that the outrage surrounding the film "Cuties" is hypocritical when you consider how mainstream audiences, including platforms like Reddit and personalities like Wubby, often celebrate and promote the sexualization of adult women in various forms of media.     On one hand, we have a film that attempts to critique the hyper-sexualization of children, and it gets condemned for allegedly exploiting minors. On the other hand, we see countless examples of adult women being objectified in music videos, advertisements, and even in social media culture, where the same kind of sexualization is not only accepted but often celebrated.     It feels like a double standard to me. We can’t condemn one form of exploitation while simultaneously turning a blind eye to another. If we truly care about the well-being of individuals, regardless of age, we should be consistent in our values.     So, while I understand the outrage against "Cuties," I think it’s important to reflect on our own consumption of media and the messages we send when we glorify the sexualization of adult women. It’s time to hold ourselves accountable and recognize that the lines we draw can often be arbitrary and hypocritical.
__label__1 I just got back from my first competition, and I’m still trying to process everything that happened! I was super nervous going in, but once I stepped on the mat, it was like all the anxiety melted away.     I had two matches. The first one was a bit of a blur. I got taken down pretty quickly and spent most of the time on my back trying to defend. I managed to escape and even got a sweep, but I ended up losing by points.     The second match was a different story. I felt more confident and was able to implement some of the techniques I’ve been working on in class. I actually got a submission! I couldn’t believe it when the ref called it.     Overall, it was an incredible experience. I learned so much about myself and my game, and I can’t wait to get back on the mat and train harder. Anyone else have a similar experience at their first competition? What did you learn?

__label__1 I've been working out for a while now, and I've noticed that my calves have become quite muscular. While I appreciate the strength, I'm looking to slim them down a bit for aesthetic reasons.     I've read that reducing muscle size can be achieved through a combination of lower weight training, higher repetitions, and focusing on cardio. However, I'm unsure about the best approach to specifically target my calves.     Here are a few questions I have:  1. Should I completely avoid calf exercises, or is there a way to modify them to prevent further muscle growth?  2. What types of cardio are most effective for reducing calf size?   3. Are there any dietary changes I should consider to help with this process?    Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 The question of when Earth might become uninhabitable for humans is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including climate change, environmental degradation, and potential catastrophic events.     Currently, scientists warn that if we do not take significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we could see severe impacts on our climate by the end of this century. This includes rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity, which could make certain areas of the planet less hospitable or even uninhabitable.    Some estimates suggest that if current trends continue, parts of the world could become uninhabitable by 2050 due to extreme heat and lack of water. However, it's important to note that these changes will not happen uniformly across the globe. Some regions may become more difficult to live in, while others may remain relatively stable.    Additionally, other factors such as nuclear war, pandemics, or asteroid impacts could also pose existential threats to humanity, but these are harder to predict.    Ultimately, the timeline for Earth becoming uninhabitable is uncertain and heavily influenced by human actions today. By addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices, we can potentially extend the habitability of our planet for future generations.

__label__1 I recently got my hands on the DM11 SBT90.2 flashlight, and I have to say, I'm really impressed! This little powerhouse packs a serious punch with its SBT90.2 LED, delivering an incredible output of up to 4000 lumens.     One of the standout features for me is the beam distance; it can reach up to 800 meters, which is perfect for my outdoor adventures. The throw is tight and focused, making it ideal for spotting things in the distance without flooding the area too much.     The build quality feels solid, and it has a nice weight to it, which gives me confidence in its durability. It’s also rated IPX8 for water resistance, so I don’t have to worry about using it in the rain or during my camping trips.     I appreciate the multiple brightness levels and the strobe function, which can be useful in emergencies. The UI is straightforward, making it easy to switch between modes even with gloves on.     The only downside I’ve noticed is that it can get a bit warm on the highest setting after prolonged use, but that’s to be expected with such high output. Overall, I think the DM11 SBT90.2 is a fantastic flashlight for anyone looking for a powerful, reliable light for both everyday carry and outdoor use.     Has anyone else had experience with this model? What are your thoughts?
__label__0 I'm about to get on a plane in male mode and stay with my parents (in another state) for the next three days. They are in their eighties, and while it would be a huge relief to me for them to know, I know them well enough to know that even if they accepted it, it would only cause me headaches. They are judgmental, prone to gossip, and emotionally distant. That my alcoholic sister still lives with them doesn't help.    I've kind of pinpointed my reasoning on their fundamental emotional distance. It wasn't until about ten years ago that I learned how to seek out and participate in relationships that are actually supportive, and my parents have simply never been supportive to me regarding anything in any meaningful way.    Still, I'm posting this seven weeks into HRT, when my only real concerns are my painted toenails, piercing holes in my ears, and mosquito bite breasts. I have no idea what changes are in store for me, or what the future will bring. Maybe estrogen will improve our relationship, even if they never find out about it.    (It occurs to me that our relationship is such that, were they to somehow find out about my transition elsewhere, they would probably prefer to never bring it up so long as I remained in male mode around them.)
__label__1 I just wanted to share a little frugal tip I discovered today! I confirmed that you don’t actually need a Costco membership to shop there if you have a Costco gift card. This is a game changer for those of us who want to take advantage of the great deals at Costco without committing to a membership fee.    Here’s how it works: If you receive a Costco gift card, you can use it to shop at any Costco location, even if you’re not a member. Just present the gift card at checkout, and you’re good to go! This is perfect for anyone who wants to try out Costco or just needs to pick up a few items without the upfront cost of a membership.    I plan to use this to stock up on some bulk items that I know I can’t find cheaper elsewhere. If you have friends or family who are members, you could also ask them to get you a gift card, or you could buy one for yourself if you know you’ll be shopping there soon.     Has anyone else used this method? What are your favorite Costco finds?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my progress and hopefully inspire some of you on your own journeys.     About six months ago, I decided it was time to take control of my health. I was at my heaviest, weighing in at 250 pounds, and I felt sluggish and unhappy. I knew I needed to make a change, not just for my appearance but for my overall well-being.     I started by tracking my food intake using an app, which helped me become more aware of what I was eating. I focused on incorporating more whole foods into my diet—fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains—while cutting back on processed foods and sugary drinks. I also started meal prepping on Sundays, which has made it so much easier to stick to my goals during the week.     In addition to changing my diet, I began exercising regularly. I started with short walks and gradually worked my way up to more intense workouts, including strength training and cardio. I found a local gym that I love, and I even joined a group fitness class, which has made working out so much more enjoyable.     As of today, I’m down 40 pounds! I feel so much better physically and mentally. I have more energy, my mood has improved, and I’m starting to feel more confident in my own skin. I still have a long way to go, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far.     For anyone who’s struggling, remember that it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Celebrate the small victories, and don’t be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks. Find what works for you and stick with it!     Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear about your journeys too!
__label__1 I've been on the hunt for a bag that has a similar aesthetic to the one in the picture I found online. It's a sleek, minimalist design with a leather finish, and I love how versatile it looks for both casual and semi-formal outfits.     If anyone has suggestions on where to find something like this, I would really appreciate it! I'm looking for options that are high-quality but also reasonably priced. Brands that focus on clean lines and a modern look would be ideal.     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 Words cannot describe how much I love Jinbei as a character, from his personality, backstory and overall impact of a few of the straw-hat members such as Luffy and Nami, Not to mention how much of a generally chill and nice guy he is (Such as that time he stayed inside during the festival to watch and appreciate the chef preparing and even commenting on how good it looks.      So as much as we hate Yamato joining (I'm one of them dw), Let's at least be happy that we got this guy on the crew as well.
__label__1 I've been playing a lot of the latest Cold War title, and I have to say, the aim assist is driving me crazy. It feels like it’s way too strong, especially in close-quarters combat. I find myself getting killed by players who seem to have a direct line on me without even aiming properly.     I understand that aim assist is there to help players, especially those who might not have the best aim, but it feels like it’s tipping the scales too much in their favor. It’s frustrating to put in the effort to line up a shot only to have the game almost do it for the other player.     I really hope the developers take a look at this and consider toning it down a bit. It would make for a more balanced and competitive experience. Anyone else feeling the same way?

__label__1 Hi everyone! I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant and have been navigating some challenging conversations with my mom, who has chosen not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. I completely respect her decision, but it has created some tension as I want to ensure a safe environment for my baby once they arrive.    I’ve tried to express my concerns about her being around the baby, especially in the early months when their immune system will be developing. I want her to be involved in our lives, but I also worry about the risks.     Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you approach the conversation? Any tips on how to set boundaries while still maintaining a loving relationship? I really want to find a way to make this work without causing too much conflict. Thanks in advance for your advice!

__label__1 I've been on the journey to find a spouse for quite some time now, and honestly, I'm starting to feel really discouraged. I’ve tried various methods—dating apps, community events, and even family introductions—but nothing seems to be working out.     I often find myself questioning if I’m being too picky or if my expectations are unrealistic. I want someone who shares my values, is committed to their faith, and has similar life goals, but it feels like those qualities are hard to come by.     Sometimes, I feel like I’m putting in all this effort for nothing, and it’s exhausting. I see friends getting married and starting families, and I can’t help but feel left behind.     Has anyone else felt this way? How did you cope with the frustration of searching for a partner? Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I really want to keep my faith and hope alive, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult.
__label__0 I am a onetrick support that has been having problems with this item.    I am having a really difficult time warding for objectives when the game is even.  I generally get to an obj about 45 sec to 1 min early to drop wards and secure the area.  But then the enemy support walks by with their umbral and oneshots all my wards to the point it looks like I didn't ward at all, and we lose the obj because of no vision.  Senna in particular is already really strong with the durability patch, having umbral as well makes her feel absurd this season when she used to be an easy match, now she feels extremely oppressive at all points of the game bc of this item alone.    I am not one to complain about balance in this game but it just feels really unfair as a non-ad support bc it is showing up in almost every game now with no answer for it.  Even worse is when the enemy jg or top picks one up too, it feels like my vision is completely useless. I feel like the cd on the item is way too low for what it does, it has almost no downtime when you know it's not available for them.    How can I play around this item?
__label__1 I know this is going to ruffle some feathers, but I genuinely believe that Jay-Z's "Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse" is his best album. While many fans and critics often point to "The Blueprint" or "Reasonable Doubt" as his magnum opus, I think they overlook the depth and ambition of Blueprint 2.    First off, the album is a double disc, which already sets it apart from most of his other works. It showcases a wide range of styles and themes, from the introspective tracks like "Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)" to the more commercial hits like "Excuse Me Miss" and "The Bounce." This variety not only highlights Jay-Z's versatility as an artist but also his ability to appeal to different audiences.    Moreover, the production on Blueprint 2 is phenomenal. With contributions from legendary producers like Kanye West, Just Blaze, and Timbaland, the beats are innovative and memorable. Tracks like "Poppin' Tags" and "What They Gonna Do" are still bangers that hold up today.    Lyrically, Jay-Z dives into personal struggles, societal issues, and his rise to fame, making it a more comprehensive reflection of his life and career at that point. The storytelling is rich, and you can feel the passion behind each verse.     I get that opinions on music are subjective, but I think Blueprint 2 deserves more recognition in Jay-Z's discography. It’s a bold, ambitious project that captures the essence of his artistry and the evolution of hip-hop during that era. So, there it is—Blueprint 2 is Jay-Z's best album, and I stand by it.
__label__1 I have to say, my favorite weapon in Horizon Forbidden West has to be the **Sharpshot Bow**. The versatility it offers is just incredible! I love how it allows for both precision shots and the ability to use elemental arrows. The way it feels to line up a shot and take down a machine from a distance is so satisfying.     Plus, the different types of arrows you can craft really add to the strategy of combat. Whether I'm using the piercing arrows to take down tougher foes or the elemental arrows to exploit weaknesses, it always feels like I have the right tool for the job.     What about you all? Do you prefer the Sharpshot Bow, or do you have another weapon that you find yourself gravitating towards?
__label__1 Hey Houston!     I’m looking for some advice on using Nitro-phos weed & feed for my lawn. I’ve heard mixed opinions about applying it during the summer months, especially with our heat and humidity.     Is it safe to use it now, or should I wait until the fall? I want to keep my grass healthy and green, but I also don’t want to damage it with the heat. Any tips or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks!
__label__1 I've been struggling with what I can only describe as health paranoia for the past few months, and it's really starting to take a toll on my mental well-being. It all started when I read an article about a rare illness, and since then, I've become hyper-aware of every little ache and pain in my body.     At first, I thought it was just a phase, but now I find myself constantly Googling symptoms and convincing myself that I have serious health issues. I’ve been to the doctor multiple times, and each time they assure me that I’m perfectly healthy, but I still can’t shake this feeling of dread.     I know that my anxiety is likely amplifying these thoughts, but it feels so real and overwhelming. I’ve started avoiding social situations because I’m afraid of what might happen if I’m away from home and something goes wrong. I feel trapped in my own mind, and it’s exhausting.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with these feelings? I could really use some support and advice on how to manage this health paranoia. Thank you for reading.
__label__1 I just wanted to share my experience with the Star ending glitch that I encountered during my playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077. After completing the main storyline and choosing the Star ending, I was really excited to see how everything would wrap up. However, when the credits rolled, I noticed that the game didn’t save my choices properly, and I ended up back in the same spot as before the final mission!    I tried reloading my save and going through the ending sequence again, but the same thing happened. It was frustrating because I had invested so much time into the game, and I wanted to see the consequences of my choices.     After some digging online, I found out that this glitch has been affecting quite a few players. Some suggested that it might be related to specific choices made earlier in the game or certain side quests that were left incomplete.     If anyone else has experienced this glitch, I’d love to hear your stories! Did you find a workaround, or did you have to restart your game? Also, has anyone heard if CD Projekt Red is planning to patch this issue in future updates? It would be a shame for players to miss out on the full experience due to a bug like this.

__label__0 I think it would have made a much more interesting character arc for Quinn than what she got. It seemed like each season they developed her and then scratched that development, made her crazy and selfish again and then developed her again. They also had her go from guy to to guy. I think having her juggle school, glee, cheerleading, motherhood, friendships and relationships would have been much more interesting and better development for her and honestly for puck too..seeing him go from womanizer and bully to proud dad who was absolutely adorable with Beth (let's forget about Mark and kids for a sec and focus on puck). It would have been interesting to see them co parent snd to have the glee club see her as their niece       Plus Shelby is awful. She was awful in season 1 and that whole story arc of her and puck in season 3 is gross. Shelby didn't deserve Beth after her interaction with Rachel.

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m starting a YouTube channel focused on language learning, specifically aimed at helping people learn English as a second language. I’m a native English speaker and I’ve been teaching English for a few years now, so I want to share my tips, tricks, and resources with others who are looking to improve their language skills.    My channel will feature a variety of content, including:  - Vocabulary lessons  - Grammar tips  - Pronunciation guides  - Cultural insights  - Fun challenges and quizzes to test your skills    I believe that learning a language should be fun and engaging, so I’m planning to incorporate games and interactive elements into my videos. I’d love to hear your thoughts on what kind of content you’d find most helpful or entertaining!     If you’re interested in following my journey, I’d appreciate any support, whether it’s subscribing, sharing your feedback, or just stopping by to say hi! I’m excited to connect with fellow language enthusiasts and help each other grow.     Thanks for your time, and I can’t wait to share my first video with you all soon!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I recently adopted a leopard gecko, and I think she’s still adjusting to her new environment. She seems a bit skittish and sometimes gets really defensive when I try to handle her. I’ve read that it can take time for them to feel comfortable, but I want to make sure I’m doing everything I can to help her settle in.    Here are a few things I’ve been doing:  1. **Creating a Safe Space**: I’ve made sure her enclosure is set up with plenty of hides and places to feel secure. I also keep the temperature and humidity levels in check.  2. **Minimizing Stress**: I try to keep the noise down around her and avoid sudden movements near her tank. I also limit the number of times I open her enclosure each day.  3. **Gentle Handling**: When I do handle her, I make sure to do it gently and for short periods. I let her come to me instead of grabbing her right away.    I’m wondering if there are any other tips or tricks you all might have for helping her adjust and feel less angry or defensive. How long did it take for your geckos to warm up to you? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey Braves fans in NYC!     With the postseason heating up, I wanted to see if anyone has recommendations for the best spots to catch the games in the city.

__label__1 I can't believe it, I just got betrayed by scavs for the fifth time this wipe! I was feeling pretty good about my run on Customs, had a decent loadout and was ready to hit some loot spots. I even had a couple of good encounters with other players, but nothing too crazy.     So there I was, creeping through the warehouses, when I spotted a group of scavs. I thought, "Great, I can take them out and loot their bodies for some extra gear!" I took my time, lined up my shots, and dropped one of them. But then, out of nowhere, the remaining scavs turned on me! I thought they were supposed to be friendly if you don’t shoot first, but nope! They lit me up before I even had a chance to react.     This isn’t the first time this has happened this wipe. I’ve been trying to play more cautiously, but it seems like every time I encounter scavs, they just decide to go rogue. I get that it’s part of the game, but it’s so frustrating!     Has anyone else been experiencing this? Is there a trick to avoid getting betrayed by scavs, or is it just the nature of the beast? I’m starting to feel like I can’t trust anyone in this game, even the AI! Any tips or stories would be appreciated!
__label__1 I recently came across a roof moisture barrier product and was wondering if it could be effectively used for sealing concrete surfaces. I have a concrete patio that has developed some cracks and I want to prevent water from seeping in and causing further damage.    From what I understand, moisture barriers are designed to prevent water from penetrating surfaces, which is exactly what I need. However, I’m not sure if the properties of a roof moisture barrier would be suitable for concrete.     Has anyone here used a roof moisture barrier on concrete? If so, what was your experience? Did it adhere well, and did it hold up against the elements? Also, are there any specific preparation steps I should take before applying it to ensure the best results?     I appreciate any advice or tips you can share!
__label__1 I've been playing Overwatch for a while now, and I've hit a wall where I feel completely stuck at 100% completion for the Battle Pass.

Is there a hidden challenge or something I might be missing? I really want to unlock the final rewards, but it feels like I've exhausted all my options. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!     Also, how do you guys feel about the current Battle Pass system? Do you think it encourages players to keep grinding, or does it feel a bit too much like a chore? Let's discuss!
__label__0 My job requires me to move around between different locations multiple times a day. I rely very heavily on Google Calendar on my phone to tell me where I need to go next and at what time I need to get there. I would love to be able to glance down at a watch and know exactly what my next move is. So my questions are:    1. Can I sync my Google Calendar from Redmi phone onto a Galaxy Watch? Will they play nicely together? I've read through a few threads about this topic in this subreddit, but they are all full of deleted comments.   2. Would someone be able to share with me a photo of what the calendar looks like on their watch? Like via imgur or something like that. I really want to know what I'll be staring at 40 times a day.     Thank you all in advance!
__label__0 I am easily tired with a lot of activities and duties. This is why back when in the universities I did not really join any group activities and studying third language because school itself is already exhausting; even though I actually have time for those. For me exercising is just making me tired and not increasing my stamina. I prefer having extra time to rest than doing physical activities. Basically I choose to exercise less not because I hate physical activities, but it is because to rest my body    I want to do a lot of things. There are things I want to do like learning third languages, go to gym, learning music instrument, gaming, in addition to doing my duties. But my body just cannot take it. Any advices?

__label__1 We're expecting baby number two and are having a tough time coming up with a name! Our first child is named Clara, and we want something that complements her name nicely. We’re open to both boy and girl names, but we prefer something classic or vintage, similar to Clara.     For a girl, we’ve considered names like Alice, Eleanor, and Hazel, but we’re not completely sold on any of them yet. For a boy, we’ve thought about Henry, Oliver, and Arthur, but again, nothing feels just right.     We’d love to hear your suggestions! What names do you think would pair well with Clara? Any thoughts on the names we’ve considered? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I feel like I’m drowning in shame, and it’s suffocating me. Every day, I wake up with this heavy weight on my chest, a constant reminder of my past mistakes and failures. It’s like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere I go, whispering lies about my worth and my ability to change.    I know I’m not alone in feeling this way, but it often feels like I am. I look around and see people who seem to have it all together, and I can’t help but compare myself to them. I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle of self-loathing, where every time I try to lift myself up, that shame pulls me back down.    I’ve made choices that I regret, and I can’t seem to forgive myself for them. It’s hard to move forward when I’m constantly haunted by the past. I want to be better, to feel better, but the shame keeps telling me that I don’t deserve it.     I’m reaching out here because I need to know that I’m not alone in this struggle. How do you cope with feelings of shame? How do you begin to forgive yourself? I’m tired of feeling this way, and I just want to find a way to break free from this cycle.
__label__1 I've been using Blind for a while now to connect with other professionals in the tech industry, but I've started to wonder about the safety and privacy aspects of the platform. For those who may not know, Blind is an anonymous community where employees can discuss their companies, share salary information, and ask for advice without revealing their identities.    Here are a few concerns I have:  1. **Anonymity**: While the platform promotes anonymity, how secure is it really? Can someone trace my identity back to me if I post something controversial or sensitive?  2. **Data Privacy**: What kind of data does Blind collect, and how is it used? Are there any risks of my information being leaked or misused?  3. **Moderation**: How effective is the moderation on Blind? Are there instances of harassment or misinformation that go unchecked?    I’d love to hear from others who have experience using Blind. Do you feel safe sharing your thoughts and experiences on the platform? Have you ever encountered any issues regarding privacy or safety? Any tips for using Blind more securely would also be appreciated!
__label__0 Grandma died yesterday. She had a 9 year old chihuahua/Pomeranian mix that has basically never left her side. She stayed in the bed with her the entire time she was on hospice and didn't really want to leave the bed even after the body had been removed. She was a shakey mess until I got her home and snuggling with my daughter in bed.    My 6 year old Daughter and dog are getting along wonderfully last night/today and she's always had a great temperament aside from wanting to be a lap guard dog sometimes but the situation isn't exactly perfect.    I've never messed with small dogs and we have a couple things to get through. I do want this dog, it's just that I've never had to mess with one very much before.    1: she's terrified of the two year old rambunctious Airedale-Poodle (who, to his credit, is being the sweetest most obedient dog he's ever been in his life while this scared girl snarls at him from atop the couch.) For now he's doing a bit more yard time than normal and getting extra walks.    2: We are a two working adult household and while we are both out of work for Hurricane Laura reasons we will have to leave this dog alone eventually and I'm worried about the separation anxiety. I'm hoping that her and her hopefully soon-to-be-large-friend are enough company but what else can we do to help her with this transition?  His work-day setup is an air-conditioned dog house (it's a big shed)  and lots of yard toys and it works for him. For her we were thinking of baby-gating off an area by the dog door that came with the house (it's her size) and maybe even baby-gating an outside area for her to bask and potty. The key thing for us in the short term is that she's not peeing on the carpeted areas. She can go through a dog door to get inside, but doesn't use one to go out at the moment.    3: She's got odd potty training in that she knows outside=potty but doesn't know inside =/= potty. The good news here is that she doesn't seem to go when she's on furniture, which is where she prefers to be. I guess I'm willing to make an exception to the no-furniture rule for her.    4: How do I walk this thing? Is it supposed to go on walks? I got her a tiny harness but she just kind of freezes up whenever I try to put either that or just a leash on. I know she hasn't been going on walks up to this point.    5. She vibrates a lot. I was reading that this is scared. Is there confidence building stuff I should be doing? I do recognize this is a pretty big transition she's going through so maybe that is part/most of it.    5: Is there any tiny dog stuff I need to know that I haven't even noticed yet? I don't even know what I don't know.    I've tried googling some of this stuff and know how I train the big pup, but am hoping for some good fast advice from y'all while we are ironing this new and unexpected situation out. Thanks for reading through the ramble, trying to line out everything myself still.
__label__0 Today I started to feel pretty good about myself, however, I am pretty scared of what would happen next, I heard lots and lots of stories of people failing cause it was painful for them like something like that and I have failed before but not in the long run, but I do feel confident and I’m like very aware of what I’m doing then I was before, and I have trust in my method and this community to help me. Let’s get to 90 days brothers!!!!
__label__1 I've been experiencing some serious lag issues while playing MultiVersus lately, and I can't help but wonder if it's related to lag switching or server problems. It seems like during certain matches, my character will freeze for a second or two, and then suddenly jump ahead, making it really hard to play effectively.     Has anyone else been facing similar issues? Do you think it's a problem with the servers, or could it be something else? I’ve heard some players mention lag switching, but I’m not sure how common that is in this game.     I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips on how to deal with lag in matches!
__label__1 Hey PenSwap!    I’m on the hunt for a **Tactile Turn Mover or Shaker**. I’ve heard great things about these pens and would love to add one to my collection.

If you have one you’re looking to part with, please let me know your asking price and any details about the pen.      Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to hearing from you!
__label__0 https://imgur.com/bbjyScJ  CW: mentions of abuse and mental illness    I've been delving into astrology since being diagnosed with BPD rather recently, which is said to be rooted in childhood trauma. I'm curious about placements that indicate abuse and trauma in my chart, since those have played an important role in my life. Here are some that I've found.    Firstly, I have a very tight conjunction of asteroids Ixion (violence? Ixion is the first murderer in Greek mythology), Nessus (abuse), Pluto, Sun, and debilitated Mercury (combust) in 12th House. I interpret this aspect as fixed/black and white thinking  (Sun/Mercury/Pluto), a symptom of BPD, due to unhealthy defense mechanism against childhood abuse by my father.    My father was verbally and physically abusive, and I imitated this abusive behavior until I was diagnosed. He was also mostly absent in my upbringing (12H sun?). I've always had bad experience with authority figures in childhood, especially the male ones. They're either neglectful, abusive, or both. That my growing BPD traits were interpreted as behavioral problem only made people use more abuse to "discipline" me.    I think I might have been sexually abused too, but I have very vague memories about it. I repress a lot of memories and some of them have only recently resurfaced (12H - hidden things).    Since Nessus is the abuser and Dejanira is the abused, I also looked at Dejanira but it doesn't form any significant aspect in my chart.    Chiron in 10H, Saturn in 4H conjunction IC: trauma involving father and family. I was pretty much left to my own devices by my neglectful parents, who were too busy dealing with their own problems.    My parents have a toxic relationship. My father wanted me to live the life he couldn't have and would verbally abuse me if I didn't live up to his expectations. He contributes nothing to the household and leeches on my. mother.    My mother projected her unhappiness with my father on me and was very manipulative. When we were fighting she would say "You don't love me!" or "Do this if you love me!" Since a young age, I learnt that love was conditional, and I had to be my parents' emotional crutch. It might be why I have poor emotional boundaries (Pisces Saturn).    For context: My Saturn is also conjunct both my parents' natal Saturns, their Chiron retrograde, and my mother's Pisces moon. My father has Canced Sun conjunct Moon and Mercury conjunct Venus in my 8th house. My parents' Pluto are conjunct my MC, opposing my Saturn. My mother has 12H Scorpio Sun conjunct Neptune and Scorpio Ascendant, all in my 12H. 8H and 12H synastry in parent-child relationship are... difficult, to say the least.    My parents have a tendency to blame other people and victimize themselves, and when I was younger I was often the scapegoat. I have a good relationship with my mother now, but not my father.    Lastly, my natal Saturn is square my personal placements in 1H and Jupiter. At first I wondered why I wasn't like a Sagittarius despite having a huge Sag stellium, but then I realized that trauma (Saturn) restricts me from showing who I am.    I understand emotion on a logical level, and I feel them very strongly (Ascendant conjunct Moon and Jupiter). But I am very emotionally detached and have trouble identifying my emotions. I also can't connect emotionally with other people.    I'd love to hear your thoughts about my interpretation or maybe there's anything I missed in my chart. Thank you!
__label__0 This is a complete overshare but I just want to get things off my chest and hear from other ace people. So a few weeks ago I got on Hinge and Bumble thinking that I'd learn about myself by meeting new people which is something I don't do a lot of. I've been on two dates with a guy and during the first date he asked if I was bisexual (there's relevant context, he didn't ask in a creepy way) and I just said that it was complicated. I really wish I had told him right then that I'm ace. I don't have a massive crush on him but I do want to spend more time with him to see if I could develop more feelings for him. However, I know that I need to tell him I am ace and I am nearly certain that if/when I tell him that then he will stop talking to me. I understand sex is important to some people and it's a compatibility thing so him not wanting to be with an ace person is valid. I don't have my sexual orientation on my dating profiles and I know that I should have it on. I don't think I'm like "baiting" people by not mentioning I'm ace but I think that fewer people would be interested if I put it on my profile. Again, I know that by putting it on my profile I could potentially weed out some of the bad ones. I went on a Bumble date with a guy awhile ago and it more naturally came up that I'm ace over texting. We had the date then he ghosted me. I don't know if he ghosted specifically because I'm ace but it very well could've been a reason. Being ace and dating men is hard. This whole thing makes me sad.     TLDR; I want to keep going on dates with a guy but I know that I shouldn't lead him on and that I should be upfront about being ace and I'm having a lot of conflicting thoughts.
__label__0 Gospel: Matthew 15:21-28    Friends, a long tradition stresses the perseverance of the Canaanite woman we meet in today’s Gospel. Augustine says that we pray in order to expand our will to accept what God is going to give us. Another reading shows how the woman exemplifies the proper attitude toward God, a combination of humility and boldness, of deference and defiance. We are creatures and God is God; nevertheless, God invites us into intimacy with him.    But I want to emphasize the reading conditioned by the "other." The Old Testament speaks insistently of the "stranger, the widow, and the orphan." The ethical life, in a biblical framework, is about the press of these people upon us. They press upon us even when we would greatly prefer them just to go away.    We the Church are the Body of Christ. And so people come to us demanding food, sustenance, friendship, love, shelter, or liberation. Often we are tempted to do what Jesus does initially and what the disciples do: tell them to back off. We are overloaded, busy, and preoccupied. We can’t be bothered.    But the whole of the Christian life consists in remembering the suffering and need of the annoying other.
__label__1 I’m in a bit of a confusing situation with my girlfriend (22F) and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if I’m actually being guilt-tripped. We’ve been together for about a year and things have generally been good, but lately, I’ve noticed a pattern that’s been bothering me.    A few weeks ago, I had to cancel our plans last minute because of work commitments. I felt really bad about it, but I thought she understood. However, since then, she’s been bringing it up in conversations, saying things like, "I guess work is more important than spending time with me," or "I just wish you cared enough to prioritize our time together." It makes me feel really guilty, even though I know I had a legitimate reason for canceling.    I’ve tried to explain my side, but it feels like every time I do, she just gets more upset and says I’m not being considerate of her feelings. I want to be supportive and understanding, but I also feel like I’m being made to feel bad for something I couldn’t control.     I’ve also noticed that when I try to talk about my own feelings or needs, she often turns the conversation back to her and how she feels neglected. I’m starting to feel like I can’t express myself without her feeling hurt or angry, which makes me hesitant to bring up anything that might upset her.    I really care about her and want to make things work, but I’m starting to feel overwhelmed by this dynamic. Am I overreacting? Is this guilt-tripping, or is she just expressing her feelings? How can I approach this situation without making things worse?     TL;DR: My girlfriend seems to be guilt-tripping me about canceling plans for work, and I’m unsure if I’m overreacting or if this is a pattern I need to address.
__label__0 I don’t really want to go into too much detail but I was talking to this super amazing chick on Reddit and everything was really awesome but suddenly she just blocked me out of the blue, straight up ghosted me. I just need some inspiring words at the moment 🙁
__label__0 Up until a few days ago, my six year old cat Lucy had no problems jumping onto her favorite window ledge above my bed or on the sink counter so she can drink from the tap (which is her primary source of water while I'm awake, she doesn't like fountains and she doesn't like drinking from a bowl). Unfortunately, an incident occurred where she misjudged her jump to the window ledge (it's only 30 inches above my bed, since this is a basement room) and she couldn't quite get a grip and fell off, landing on my face and leaving me with a brand new scar on the side of my face.    Since that happened, she's been extremely nervous about jumping up that far to the ledge or the sink counter and it takes her several minutes to work up the courage. I checked her out after the fall to make sure she hadn't injured anything, and besides a bruised ego, she's perfectly fine. Strangely, she has no problem jumping up to my bed which is also a 30 inch jump.    Is there anything I can do to help her get over it? She hasn't been in the ledge since then which I can't imagine is the best, since her favorite place to sleep is the bed I put up there, and I don't want to have to lift her up every time she wants to get up there, and I feel bad for her.
__label__1 Promoting inclusivity in everyday life can be a rewarding and impactful endeavor. Here are some practical steps you can take:    1. **Educate Yourself**: Take the time to learn about different cultures, identities, and experiences. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow diverse voices on social media to broaden your understanding.    2. **Listen Actively**: When engaging with others, practice active listening. Give people the space to share their experiences and perspectives without interrupting or dismissing them.    3. **Use Inclusive Language**: Be mindful of the language you use. Opt for gender-neutral terms when appropriate and avoid slang or phrases that may alienate certain groups.    4. **Challenge Stereotypes**: If you hear someone making a stereotypical comment or joke, speak up. Gently challenge these notions and encourage a more respectful dialogue.    5. **Support Diverse Voices**: Whether it’s in your workplace, community, or social circles, advocate for the inclusion of diverse voices in decision-making processes. This can mean supporting minority-owned businesses or amplifying the work of underrepresented artists and creators.    6. **Create Safe Spaces**: If you’re in a position to do so, foster environments where everyone feels safe to express themselves. This could be in a classroom, workplace, or community group.    7. **Be Mindful of Accessibility**: Consider the physical and digital spaces you inhabit. Are they accessible to everyone? Advocate for changes that make spaces more inclusive for people with disabilities.    8. **Engage in Community Service**: Volunteer with organizations that focus on helping marginalized communities. This not only helps those in need but also gives you a deeper understanding of the challenges they face.    9. **Celebrate Diversity**: Participate in or organize events that celebrate different cultures and identities. This could be through festivals, workshops, or educational seminars.    10. **Reflect on Your Own Biases**: Take time to reflect on your own biases and privileges. Acknowledging these can help you understand how they may affect your interactions with others.    By incorporating these practices into your daily life, you can contribute to a more inclusive society and encourage others to do the same.

__label__1 I just had my first shroom trip in over a year, and wow, it was an experience that really brought back some profound realizations. I took a moderate dose, around 3 grams, and settled into a comfortable space with some calming music and dim lighting.     As the effects started to kick in, I felt this wave of warmth and connection to everything around me. It was like I was seeing the world through a new lens, where colors were more vibrant and sounds were more resonant. I found myself reflecting on my life, my relationships, and the choices I’ve made.     One of the most striking moments was when I realized how much I had been holding onto past regrets and fears. It was as if the mushrooms were gently nudging me to let go of that baggage. I felt a sense of clarity wash over me, and I understood that every experience, good or bad, has shaped who I am today.     I also had this deep sense of interconnectedness with nature. I spent some time outside, and I felt like I could almost hear the trees and the wind communicating with me. It reminded me of how important it is to stay grounded and connected to the world around us.     After the trip, I felt a renewed sense of purpose and a desire to be more present in my daily life. I’ve been inspired to reach out to friends I haven’t spoken to in a while and to focus on the things that truly matter to me.     Has anyone else had a similar experience after a long break from shrooms? I’d love to hear your stories and insights!

__label__1 With the recent discussions around player housing in World of Warcraft, I wanted to get the community's thoughts on the possibility of it making a return. Many players have fond memories of the garrisons from Warlords of Draenor, and while they had their flaws, they offered a sense of ownership and personalization that many of us enjoyed.    Do you think player housing could be implemented in a way that enhances the game? Would you prefer something similar to garrisons, or do you envision a different approach, like a more open and customizable system akin to what we see in other MMOs?     Also, how do you think player housing could impact the social aspect of the game? Would it encourage more player interaction, or do you think it would lead to more isolation?     I’m really curious to hear your opinions on this! What features would you like to see if player housing were to return?
__label__0 It was an even game going in, and it was a few seconds away from Zapdos. I decide to go for Dred, in hopes of my team coming down (Only one guy did). Unsurprisingly, I die to them as it was a 4v2, but then I notice that my respawn is 34 seconds away. The problem with this is one, Zap spawned right after I died, so I was out for most of the end, two, this is an absurd amount of time to wait to continue playing, as I don’t normally get this, and it just doesn’t make sense why the game punished you for actually doing good, at least not this much, three, the moment I respawned was the moment the other team got Zap, as only two other teammates went for zap, while the entire other team was there as well, and four, the next few respawns were much shorter than this one, which baffles me, as there should be no reason why I had to wait that long to respawn at the most important part of the match. While I am fine with the respawn timer increasing as the game goes on equally for everyone, I don’t like how if you are actually doing good and carry your team, that when you die, you’re more punished than everyone else. Stuff like this is why many hate solo queue, as they can be carrying their team, but once they die, you’re all of a sudden out for the entire important part of the match, where if it was equal, there would be more of a fair chance in the game. I hope UNITE developers change this so at least when time increases, it’s more consistent and equal for everyone, cause I hate how I mainly lost because the game made me lose.

__label__1 I recently adopted a sweet little cat named Luna, and while she’s been a joy to have around, we’ve run into a bit of a problem. Since bringing her home, she seems to have some issues with using the litter box. At first, she was using it just fine, but now she’s started peeing outside of it.     I’ve tried a few things to help her adjust. I made sure the litter box is in a quiet, accessible spot and I’ve kept it clean, scooping it daily. I’ve also tried different types of litter to see if she has a preference, but nothing seems to be working.     Luna is still getting used to her new environment, and I’m wondering if this could be a stress-related issue. She’s a bit shy and still figuring out her place in our home. I’ve read that some cats can take a while to adjust, but I’m worried about the peeing.     Has anyone else experienced this with a newly adopted cat? Any tips or advice on how to help her feel more comfortable and encourage her to use the litter box consistently? I really want to make sure she feels at home and safe. Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 I need some relationship advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years, but he still keeps tabs on his ex-girlfriend via Instagram and Snapchat . They were engaged and lost both their virginities to each other.  They broke up six years ago and had no contact for four years after the breakup. He reached out to her 2 years ago (a month before we started officially dating) and began talking to her. They have each other on social media and I thought nothing about it at first. After one year and a half of dating, we bought a house together which was exciting. I just don’t know if he’s actually moved on. He’s only mentioned our relationship publicly on social media twice and didn’t even include my face, while I’ve frequently posted a lot about us. He’s still been keeping connection with her for the ENTIRE duration of our relationship. He even liked a bikini pic of hers on Instagram.  Is this healthy? Would you consider this to be cheating?
__label__1 Dysphoria is a term that describes a profound sense of unease or dissatisfaction, often related to one's identity or body. For many transgender individuals, dysphoria can manifest as a disconnect between their gender identity and their physical appearance or societal expectations. It can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and frustration, as the person struggles with the mismatch between how they feel inside and how they are perceived externally.    For example, someone assigned female at birth who identifies as male might experience dysphoria when looking in the mirror and seeing breasts or a feminine face. This can be incredibly distressing and can affect various aspects of life, including social interactions, self-esteem, and mental health.    Dysphoria isn't the same for everyone; some may experience it intensely, while others might feel it more subtly. It's important to recognize that dysphoria is a valid experience and that seeking support, whether through therapy, community, or medical transition options, can be helpful in managing these feelings. Understanding dysphoria is a crucial step in the journey of many transgender individuals as they work towards aligning their external reality with their internal identity.
__label__1 I’m a 21-year-old woman who stands at 4'9”, and I’ve been wondering if my height is a significant turnoff for potential romantic interests. I’ve never been asked out or shown any romantic interest, and I don’t have a best friend either, which makes me question if my height plays a role in this.    I know that attraction is subjective, and everyone has their preferences, but I can’t help but feel self-conscious about it. I’ve heard mixed opinions from friends and family, some say it doesn’t matter, while others suggest that taller men might not be as interested in someone my height.     I’m curious to hear from the men in this subreddit: does height really matter to you when it comes to dating? Have you ever dated someone who is significantly shorter than you? What are your thoughts on dating someone who is 4'9”? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Something smells fishy about the odds for tonight's game between the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. The Knicks are currently favored by 5 points, but considering the Heat's recent form and their ability to perform in high-pressure situations, I think this line is off.    The Heat have been playing some solid basketball lately, and their defense has been stifling. Plus, with Jimmy Butler back in the lineup, they have a proven leader who can take over games. The Knicks, while they have home-court advantage, have struggled against teams with strong perimeter shooting, and the Heat can definitely exploit that.    I’m leaning towards taking the Heat to cover the spread. They’ve shown they can compete with the best, and I think they’ll keep this game close, if not win outright.     Miami Heat +5      Let’s see if we can cash in on this one!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about the song "Homecoming" from Green Day’s *American Idiot* and how it’s often seen as a bit of a mixed bag among fans. Some love it for its ambitious structure and the way it ties the album together, while others feel it’s a bit too chaotic. But what if we reimagined it as a more cohesive and polished piece?     Imagine if the transitions between the different sections were smoother, allowing the emotional weight of the lyrics to really hit home. The first part, "The Death of St. Jimmy," could have a more haunting melody that builds up to the explosive energy of "East 12th St." Instead of feeling like a jarring shift, it could flow seamlessly, creating a narrative arc that feels more like a journey.     The climax could be even more powerful, with a full orchestral arrangement that elevates the final section, "Homecoming," to anthemic heights. Picture Billie Joe’s vocals soaring over a rich tapestry of instruments, capturing the essence of longing and resolution.     I think if "Homecoming" had been approached with a bit more focus on melody and cohesion, it could have been one of the standout tracks of their discography. What do you all think? How would you change it to make it better?
__label__1 I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I just don't understand why smoking cigarettes is often viewed so negatively, while smoking weed seems to be more accepted or even celebrated in some circles.     Cigarettes are known to cause serious health issues, and there's a lot of public health campaigns against them, which makes sense. But with weed, even though it can have its own health risks, it seems like there's a growing movement to legalize and normalize it.     Is it just because of the stigma that has historically surrounded marijuana? Or is it more about the cultural perceptions and the way society views the two substances? I’m genuinely curious about the reasons behind this difference in attitudes. Can anyone shed some light on this? Thanks!

__label__1 I recently came across the term "Target Confirmed Voucher" while playing PUBG and I'm a bit confused about what it actually means and how it works.     From what I understand, it seems to be related to the new voucher system that was introduced in the game, but I can't find much information on how to use it or what benefits it provides.     Does anyone know if this voucher can be redeemed for in-game items or currency? Also, how do you actually earn these vouchers? Is it tied to specific missions or events?     Any insights or experiences you guys have with the Target Confirmed Voucher would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I know that mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships can often be fraught with tension and misunderstandings, but I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else feels the same way I do.     I have a fantastic relationship with my mother-in-law. From the moment I started dating her son, she welcomed me with open arms. She treats me like her own daughter, and we have so much in common. We enjoy cooking together, sharing stories, and even binge-watching our favorite shows. I appreciate her wisdom and the way she supports me in my life decisions.     On the flip side, I also have a great relationship with my daughter-in-law. I always make it a point to respect her boundaries and give her space, but I love being involved in her life. We often go shopping together, and I cherish the moments we spend talking about everything from parenting to our favorite books. I try to be a supportive figure for her, just like my mother-in-law has been for me.     I know not everyone has this experience, and I feel incredibly lucky. I’d love to hear from others who have positive relationships with their in-laws. What do you think contributes to that? Any tips for maintaining a strong bond?
__label__0 Just like the title says the builder base really needs some work.   I understand the builder base is one of the worst things to come to clash of clans because it is pointless besides your 6th builder. BUT I do enjoy grinding it. I am currently a maxed th 14 with nothing to do and I’m on throughout the day because I am the leader of a lvl17 clan and like to check up on things.   I have been trying to max out my builder base because there is nothing else to do in the game and it’s only 3 attacks every day. The biggest problem I have found with the builder base is… well you guessed it.. the battle machine… why did I spend weeks on weeks getting it to level 30 if it still take 4-5 hits with the mighty hammer to destroy a lvl 3 wall…   Why did I spend weeks upgrading it just for it to avoid outside buildings and walk into crusher..   the builder base is a good concept with little to zero effort put into it. It isn’t hard to make a small update to even troops and heros in the builder base. Most people that play builder base rush for the 6th builder which is exactly what I did.  Why not make more of an incentive for playing through the builder base. Maybe add / takeaway stuff to make it more enjoyable. Welp this was my rant for the night
__label__1 I'm looking for a copy of "Media & Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication, 13th Edition" by Campbell. The ISBN is 9781319244934. If anyone has a digital or physical copy they could share or lend, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!
__label__0 This happened yesterday and I literally cannot think of a single rational explanation. I was originally hesitant to share this because it's so absurd it sounds fake, but I think this sub would be a good place to share. 7 people including me witnessed this and every single one is completely baffled.     My brother was playing a game on his laptop and then all the sudden in the middle of the game after playing for around an hour his computer crashes, and upon restarting it there is a message saying that his hard drive is not installed. He told me this and I said I would see if I could fix it as I have a decent amount of computer knowledge and I didn't want him wasting his money taking it to a repair shop that would overcharge him, especially because I figured that the hard drive just came loose and just needed to be put back into place or something like that. So I open up the computer and I find that there literally is no hard drive. Its completely gone and there's not even evidence that it was ever there in the first place. This is a laptop he's had for 2 years and hasn't had any problems. He had a ton of games installed on there and would regularly play them with no problem now all of it is suddenly gone without a trace.  My first guess was that maybe someone was trying to play some kind of weirdly specific prank on him but he always keeps his laptop at home, and nobody in my house has the knowledge of how to remove a hard drive from a computer except me and my dad, but like obviously neither of us would have a reason to take it. But even if you want to make up all kinds of theories that someone somehow took his hard drive I don't think it's possible because his computer stopped working in the middle of playing a game. Meaning it was in there when he started playing but vanished while he was using it??     This is probably one of the craziest things I have ever witnessed and everyone in my house is really freaked out. If anyone can come up with some kind of rational explanation I welcome you to share it because nobody can think of any explanation that isn't aliens or the Mandela effect or something. I'm completely at a loss for words.    Update: so y'all were right about the SSD because I found it and I think it just died and needs to be replaced. Not sure if this is either disappointing or what people wanted to hear but either way a broken SSD is covered by the warranty but a disappearing hard drive is not, so y'all saved my brother like a hundred bucks. And now I can sleep at night because I was convinced it was aliens or something lol. thank you guys for your help! I can delete this thread if needed because I didn't mean to turn it into a tech support thing.
__label__1 Hey r/mycology!      I’m currently working on my first batch of BRF cakes for mushroom cultivation and I have a few questions regarding the colonization conditions and duration. I’ve read a lot about the ideal conditions, but I want to make sure I’m on the right track.      1. **Temperature**: I’ve been keeping my jars in a warm spot around 75-80°F (24-27°C). Is this a good range for colonization, or should I aim for something different?      2. **Humidity**: I’ve noticed some condensation inside the jars, but I’m not sure if it’s too much or just right. How can I tell if the humidity is optimal for colonization?      3. **Duration**: I’ve seen varying timelines for colonization, with some saying it can take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. What has been your experience? How long should I wait before considering that something might be wrong?      4. **Contamination**: I’m a bit paranoid about contamination. What are some signs I should look for to ensure my jars are healthy?      I appreciate any insights or tips you can share! I’m really excited to see how this goes and hopefully share some successful fruiting pics in the future. Thanks!
__label__1 With the competitive scene heating up and the excitement building for the next big event, I wanted to start a discussion about the potential dates for Champions 2023. Given that the previous Champions events have typically taken place in late summer to early fall, do you think we can expect a similar timeline this year?     Some fans are speculating that it might be held in August or September, aligning with the end of the VCT season. However, with the recent changes in the tournament structure and the introduction of new formats, it’s hard to say for sure.     What are your thoughts? When do you think we’ll see Champions 2023, and what kind of venue do you hope they choose? Also, do you think they will stick to a single location or go for a multi-city format like we’ve seen in other esports? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I'm currently considering a job offer in a field that I'm not entirely sure I want to commit to long-term. I have a background in engineering, but this position is in a different industry that I find interesting but uncertain about my future in it.     On one hand, I think taking the position could provide valuable experience, help me build my network, and potentially open doors to other opportunities. On the other hand, I'm concerned about the possibility of investing time and energy into a role that I might not enjoy or want to stay in for long.     For those of you who have faced a similar decision, what factors did you consider when deciding whether to take a job in a field you weren't sure about? Did it end up being a good decision for you? Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I'm currently working on a 2D game in Godot and I'm on the lookout for some assets to help bring my project to life. Specifically, I'm in need of:      1. **Character Sprites** - I'm looking for a few different character designs, preferably with animations for walking, jumping, and attacking.    2. **Background Tilesets** - A nice tileset for creating various environments like forests, caves, and towns would be great.    3. **Sound Effects** - Any sound effects for actions like jumping, collecting items, and background music would be super helpful.    4. **UI Elements** - Buttons, health bars, and other UI components that fit a 2D style.      If anyone has recommendations for free or paid asset packs, or if you have your own assets that you’re willing to share or sell, I would love to hear about them!      Thanks in advance for your help!

Sadly our DM had to stop, because of personal reasons :(. Now we are very sad, cause we wanna continue to play together Q\_Q. A lot of our playing was RP heavier rather than combat, but we do enjoy both! (that was just how it played out) It was high fantasy-isH, most of the world was based on parts of Europe.

__label__1 I was playing a ranked match the other day, and my friend, who usually plays support, decided to switch it up and go for Reyna. I honestly didn’t expect much since they usually stick to healing and utility agents, but wow, did they surprise us all!     In the first half, they managed to drop a 30-bomb, completely turning the tide of the game. I remember one round where they got a 1v4 clutch, and it was just insane to watch. They were dodging bullets, using their dismiss to reposition, and just outplaying the enemy team left and right.     After that round, we were all hyped up, and it felt like we were riding a wave of adrenaline. It’s moments like these that make Valorant so exciting! Has anyone else had a friend pop off unexpectedly like this? What’s your favorite clutch moment from your games?

__label__1 I’m feeling really anxious and could use some support or advice. A few weeks ago, I noticed a small bump on my skin that I thought was just a pimple. I ended up popping it, and while it seemed to go away for a bit, a much larger bump has grown back in its place. It feels hard and is a bit painful to the touch, which has me worried that it might be a cyst or something more serious.    I’ve been trying to stay calm, but I can’t help but think the worst. I’ve read a bit online, and while some sources say cysts are usually harmless, I’m still scared. I’m not sure if I should wait it out or if I should see a doctor right away. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What did you do? Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

__label__1 I’m a 22-year-old woman and I’ve been seriously considering getting my tubes tied. I know this is a big decision, and I want to make sure I’m making the right choice for myself. I’ve always known that I don’t want children, and I feel like this is the best way to ensure that I don’t end up in a situation where I might change my mind or feel pressured to have kids in the future.    However, I’ve heard that many doctors are hesitant to perform this procedure on younger women, especially if they don’t have children already. I’m worried that I might face pushback or be told that I’m too young to make this decision. I’ve done a lot of research and I’m confident in my choice, but I’m not sure how to approach this with a healthcare provider.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you go about discussing this with your doctor? Any advice on how to advocate for myself and my decision would be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel empowered in my choices about my own body.
__label__1 It’s like she’s been in hibernation and now she’s ready to burst back onto the scene! I mean, just look at her recent posts—she’s all about that influencer life now, sharing her yoga routines and healthy recipes like she’s the queen of wellness.     But let’s be real, is anyone else getting a bit of a ‘look at me, I’m relatable!’ vibe? It’s almost like she’s trying to reclaim her image after all the backlash. I can’t help but wonder if she’s been taking notes from other celebs on how to stay relevant.     And don’t even get me started on her accent slipping in and out like it’s a fashion trend! One minute she’s all ‘I’m from Boston’ and the next it’s ‘Hola, amigos!’ It’s like she’s trying to keep us guessing.     What do you all think? Is this a genuine comeback or just another attempt to stay in the spotlight? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 Just released from an inpatient behavioral health program at my local hospital. Starting a pretty intensive “partial” hospitalization in a couple days.     I was diagnosed bipolar at age 14 and never dealt fully believed my diagnosis… it never really seem to fit. Hadn’t been on any mood stabilizers in over 10 years, until they started me on Risperidol 3 mg and extremely abruptly ended the 150 mg of Effexor I’ve been taking for almost 2 years… they have me diagnosed as bipolar with moderate manic episode now.     I only ever experience a “manic” episode after some kind of medical or body trauma (surgery, having babies, things like that). So here’s this timeframe. November of last year- booster shot for COVID. I also have autoimmune thyroiditis (bs diagnosis if you ask me, but pretty much I have all the antibodies and labs would go hyper to hypo for a bit then stayed hypo for awhile) which had a flair up including a new nodule found in December. My thyroid is just always swollen and my docs can seem to care less, but anyway, that seemed to trigger the start of this “episode”. But anyway, beginning of January I had a major mental breakdown which I self treated by going to an oceanfront resort and spending 3 days there practicing some meditation and just self care (ie going to the spa for 4 hours). Since then I’ve been bouncing back and forth between hypo mania and depression pretty frequently.    Got COVID on May 14th. May 23rd started with a migraine that lasted 17 days and included 3 er visits, 1 admission, and a slew of Neuro tests (mri, mra, lumbar puncture, only finding being a stenosis in a sinus or something). Around June 5th was the admission where they just kept pumping me with more and more meds to make the migraine stop (talking steady 7-8 pain levels with spikes up to 10 frequently). Oh and newfound hypertension. Amlodopine 10 mg for that. Ever since that admission, the manic episode seemed to just keep climbing until I was hospitalized 7 days ago.     I have been using medical marijuana way too much until 8 days ago. Now I’m told to stay away from it completely though it’s been the only thing keeping my anxiety at bay until now they added atarax to my regimen and told me no more mmj. I also pretty much cold Turkey have up caffeine.     Anyone have any thoughts or insights on this? I feel like the Risperidol is quite a change that may cause more negative side effects than good.
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m currently on my journey of transitioning and have been on HRT for about six months now. I’ve seen some changes that I’m really happy with, but I’m starting to think more seriously about the possibility of surgical options in the future.      I wanted to reach out to the community to hear about your experiences and thoughts on this. For those of you who have gone through surgery, how did you decide it was the right time for you? Did you feel that HRT alone was enough for you, or did you feel that surgery was necessary to feel complete in your transition?      I’m also curious about the emotional and mental aspects of making that decision. I’ve read a lot about the physical changes, but I’d love to hear how it impacted your self-image and confidence.      Thanks in advance for sharing your stories and advice! I really appreciate it.      Sending love to everyone on their own journeys!
__label__1 I’ve been following the updates on law school admissions for the upcoming cycle, and I’ve noticed that many schools are changing their application requirements. Some are now asking for video personal statements or additional essays that focus on diversity and inclusion.     I’m curious about how these changes might affect applicants. For those of you who have already gone through the application process, do you think these new requirements will make it easier or harder to get accepted?     Also, for anyone who has experience with video personal statements, what tips do you have? I’m a bit nervous about presenting myself on camera and want to make sure I come across as genuine and professional.     Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__1 I’ve been on a long journey of healing from CPTSD, and I’ve realized that one of the hardest things for me has been learning to be proud of myself. For so long, I felt like I was just surviving, going through the motions of life without really acknowledging my own strength and resilience.     Recently, I’ve started to take small steps to recognize my achievements, no matter how minor they may seem. Whether it’s getting out of bed on a tough day, completing a task I’ve been avoiding, or simply allowing myself to feel joy in a moment, I’m trying to celebrate those victories.     I’ve also been working on reframing my self-talk. Instead of focusing on what I haven’t done or how far I still have to go, I’m trying to remind myself of how far I’ve already come. It’s a process, and some days are definitely harder than others, but I’m learning that it’s okay to acknowledge my progress.     I’d love to hear from others in this community. How do you practice self-acceptance and pride in your journey? What small victories have you celebrated recently? Let’s support each other in recognizing our strength and resilience!

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 28-year-old female looking to make some meaningful connections and hopefully find a long-term friendship. I recently moved to a new city and would love to meet new people to share experiences with.    A little about me: I enjoy hiking, trying out new coffee shops, and binge-watching documentaries. I’m also a big fan of board games and love a good trivia night! I’m open to exploring new hobbies and interests, so if you have any suggestions, I’m all ears.    I’m looking for someone who is genuine, has a good sense of humor, and is interested in building a friendship based on trust and shared experiences. If you’re also looking for a friend to hang out with, chat, or explore the city together, feel free to reach out! Let’s connect!
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’ve been diving into building my first PC and I’m trying to understand how different components affect the overall performance and functionality of the system. I know that each part plays a role, but I’m curious about the specifics. Here are a few aspects I’m particularly interested in:    1. **CPU Performance**: How does the number of cores and threads impact gaming vs. productivity tasks? Is it better to have a higher clock speed or more cores for general use?    2. **GPU Impact**: I’ve read that the GPU is crucial for gaming performance, but how does it affect tasks like video editing or 3D rendering? Are there specific features I should look for in a GPU for these tasks?    3. **RAM Speed and Capacity**: I know that having enough RAM is important, but does the speed of the RAM also play a significant role? How does it affect gaming and multitasking?    4. **Storage Types**: What’s the real-world difference between SSDs and HDDs in terms of performance? How much does the read/write speed of an SSD matter for gaming or loading applications?    5. **Motherboard Features**: How do things like PCIe lanes, VRM quality, and connectivity options (USB ports, Wi-Fi, etc.) affect the overall build? Are there specific features that are essential for future-proofing?    6. **Cooling Solutions**: How important is cooling for different components? Do I need to invest in aftermarket coolers for both the CPU and GPU, or are stock coolers sufficient for most builds?    I’m looking to get a better grasp on how these components interact and what I should prioritize based on my intended use (gaming, content creation, etc.). Any insights or resources would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I've recently been prescribed Cannim Lumir 12.5/12.5 oil for my chronic pain and anxiety, and I'm curious if anyone here has had any experience with it. How did you find the effects? Did you notice any side effects?     I've read that it has a balanced THC and CBD content, which is supposed to help with both pain relief and anxiety management, but I'm a bit apprehensive about how it might affect me.     Any tips on dosage or how to incorporate it into my routine would also be appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 do you like it? what would you change?        I'ts a combination of Nord Theme and ThinkPad    https://preview.redd.it/hsb33brwlow91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2d4ae2a55a3ae39800e07cb2821e83d34137cc
__label__1 I’m in a bit of a complicated situation and I really need some advice.     So, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year now, and I genuinely care about him. He’s sweet, funny, and we have a lot of fun together. However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me.     A few months ago, I found out that he had a pretty serious gambling problem. He had been hiding it from me, and when I confronted him about it, he promised he would get help and that he would stop. I wanted to believe him, but I’ve noticed that he still goes to the casino occasionally, and I’m worried he’s not being honest with me.     Recently, I was invited to a party with some friends, and I didn’t want to go alone. I told my boyfriend that I was going to hang out with my sister instead, thinking it would be easier than explaining the whole situation. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or make him feel like I didn’t want to spend time with him.     At the party, I ended up having a great time, but I felt guilty for lying to him. I know that honesty is important in a relationship, but I was afraid of how he would react. When I got home, he asked me how my night was, and I just said it was fine, avoiding the topic of where I really was.     Now I’m feeling really conflicted. I don’t want to keep lying to him, but I also don’t want to hurt him or make things worse. I care about him, but I’m also worried about his gambling and how it might affect our relationship in the long run.     What should I do? Should I come clean about lying, or should I keep this to myself for now? How do I approach the gambling issue without making him defensive? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been struggling with addiction for a while now, and it feels like I’m trapped in this never-ending cycle. I want to quit, I really do, but every time I think I’m making progress, I find myself falling back into the same patterns.     It started off as just a way to cope with stress and anxiety. I thought it would help me feel better, but now it’s like I can’t function without it. I’ve lost friends, missed important events, and even let down my family because of my choices. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, but at the same time, I can’t seem to let go.     I’ve tried to reach out for help, but it’s hard to find the right support. I feel like people don’t really understand what I’m going through. They say things like, "Just stop," or "You need to be stronger," but it’s not that simple. I feel so alone in this struggle, and it’s exhausting.     Some days I wake up and think, "Today is the day I’ll change," but by the end of the day, I’m back to square one. I hate this feeling of being stuck, and I’m scared of what it’s doing to my body and mind. I just want to feel normal again, to be able to enjoy life without relying on something that’s slowly destroying me.     I don’t know if sharing this will help, but I just needed to vent. I’m tired of pretending everything is okay when it’s not. I hope that one day I can find the strength to truly break free from this addiction.
__label__0       My MIL has a horrible track record of crossing boundaries and trying to be overly controlling of her children. Including trying to turn her children against their own spouses and her family. She also has some sort of undiagnosed mental illness or just lies like crazy. She has told us her dad died by suicide, a heart attack, and a construction accident; the story keeps changing. Also, she has times of odd paranoia. Like the time she thought her sister was trying to steal her adult children away from her, and when she thought her 3rd husband was stealing her documents. No matter how hard we try she doesn’t get the help she needs.      My husband and I tried for years to get pregnant and once it happened, I knew the MIL would have issues. We ended up getting IVF since I have moderate endometriosis.     At one point in the past she told me that she could be my surrogate since “I wasn’t healthy enough to have a child.” And, she a 60-year-old woman was. I’m used to stupid comments like this from her. She seems to have no empathy as to what her children are going through and continues to ostracize her children-in-law. One of her biggest issues is that both me and her son-in-law are Jewish.     She doesn’t have many friends, so of course she tries to hang out with her adult children as much as possible. One weekend she brought up the conversation of what to name our child. I knew this would be an issue since everything is an issue with her. As I told her we were looking at Hebrew names she frowned at me and her eyes bulged. Then my husband said we were also thinking about family names…having a Jewish family means many Hebrew names. She looked at us and said straight faced, “You should name the child (then said her name).” Knowing she is a huge narcissist I was expecting this out of her and just said we haven’t chosen anything yet and it is up to me and my husband. I continued to let her know we aren’t taking suggestions or looking for other people to name the kid.    I changed the conversation quickly. Meanwhile she asked if she could take a picture of my bump. Which I didn’t feel comfortable with (I don’t know what she’ll do with it and don’t want it on social media), so I said no. After that she tried taking a few photos of me when I wasn’t paying attention. I told her to have a good day and went inside to get away from her.     The next week when she showed up, she asked if she could go to the ultrasound with me. I told her no, and felt uncomfortable again. Since she told me she took the full day off and wanted to go. After my husband reminded her there was no way she could go due to Covid she then tried to plan a lunch with me to hear all about the appointment. I let her know that wouldn’t work for me because I had to work.     This week when she showed up my husband didn’t even want to answer the door. But, she wouldn’t go away. I was being nice by answering and stepping out of the house to talk to her. She started to ask me questions about my diet and eyeing my body uncomfortably again. She was really focused on “are you getting all your vegetables.” Which pissed me off since I’m a yoga instructor and eat as healthy as possible. She also got mad at me for texting updates about the baby to her family she refuses to talk to.     I’m just trying to keep boundaries with her and getting frustrated with her instability. It bothers me that I’m the one in therapy getting advice on how to handle her, when she is really the one who needs the help.
__label__0 My father has had dementia for a few years. Mostly it has affected his cognitive abilities versus memory.   The last few months his memory has been declining as well. Declining in areas that I think are odd and illogical.    For instance, I found him crying the other day because he found a picture of my mom from 20 years ago and he missed her.  She is alive and living with him (for 58 years) but he doesn't seem to grasp that she is the same person. No matter how hard I try to help him remember or describe his life with her he doesn't seem to get it. He can't remember her name and always asks how long she wl be visiting.      However,  he remembers me, my husband and kids.  He can get our names mixed up but knows who we are.   (I am primary caregiver for my folks although I don't live with them. They are completely dependent on me.).     Is it not odd that the most recent memories (myself and my kids) should go first?  He has known my mom for so long that I would think knowing who she is would be the last to go?    Thoughts or experiences?
__label__1 Alright, fellow degenerates, let’s dive into the dark waters of how Citadel and their hedge fund buddies might be using our stop-loss orders against us.     So, we all know that Robinhood (RH) has a pretty big user base, and a lot of us retail traders are using it to buy and sell stocks. But here’s the kicker: when you place a stop-loss order on RH, that information isn’t just sitting there in a vacuum. Citadel, being one of the biggest market makers, has access to this data.     Now, imagine you set a stop-loss order for your beloved meme stock at $50. If the stock starts to dip, Citadel can see that there’s a cluster of stop-loss orders around that price. What do they do? They might short the stock just enough to trigger those stop-loss orders, causing a cascade of selling. This drives the price down even further, allowing them to buy back shares at a discount while we’re left holding the bag.     It’s like they’re playing a game of chess, and we’re just pawns on the board. They know where our weak spots are, and they exploit them to maximize their profits.     So, what can we do about it? Some say to avoid stop-loss orders altogether, while others suggest using mental stops or trailing stops instead. But let’s be real, it’s tough to outsmart the big players when they have all the data and resources at their disposal.     In the end, it’s a wild ride, and we’re all just trying to make some tendies. Just remember to keep your eyes peeled and your strategies sharp. Stay strong, apes!

__label__1 I've been hearing a lot of buzz about PlayStation exclusives making their way to PC. Titles like Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War have already been released on PC, and it seems like more are on the horizon.     What do you all think about this trend? Do you believe it diminishes the value of owning a PS5, or do you see it as a way to expand the audience for these amazing games?     Also, are there any specific PS5 exclusives that you hope will eventually come to PC? I personally would love to see titles like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls make the jump.     Let's discuss!
__label__1 I've been experimenting with the Guardian in ranked matches, and I wanted to share my thoughts on which agents synergize best with this weapon. The Guardian is a semi-automatic rifle that rewards precision and positioning, so I think agents who can capitalize on those strengths are ideal.    1. **Sova**: His recon abilities allow you to gather information and pick off enemies from a distance. With the Guardian's accuracy, you can take advantage of Sova's utility to get the jump on opponents.    2. **Cypher**: Similar to Sova, Cypher's traps and cameras can help you control areas and gather intel. The Guardian excels in holding angles, and Cypher can set up to catch enemies off guard.    3. **Killjoy**: Her turrets and utility can help you lock down sites, allowing you to play more defensively. The Guardian is great for holding angles, and with Killjoy's gadgets, you can create a strong defensive setup.    4. **Chamber**: His ability to teleport and create a stronghold with his weapons makes him a great fit for the Guardian. You can take a shot, teleport to safety, and reposition to take another shot without being punished.    5. **Sage**: While not a traditional pick for a Guardian-only playstyle, her healing can keep you alive longer, allowing you to take more risks with the Guardian. Plus, her wall can help you control sightlines effectively.    What do you all think? Who do you find works best with the Guardian? Any tips for maximizing its potential? Let's discuss!

__label__1 I've been experiencing a frustrating bug with the radar cue in War Thunder lately. It seems that when I lock onto a target, the radar cue doesn't always display correctly, making it difficult to gauge the distance and trajectory for missile launches.     For instance, I was flying my F-14 in a recent match, and while I had a solid lock on an enemy aircraft, the radar cue was showing a range that was way off. I ended up firing an AIM-54, but it missed by a significant margin, and I couldn't figure out why.     Has anyone else encountered this issue? Is there a workaround or a way to reset the radar system mid-flight? I’ve tried toggling the radar on and off, but that doesn’t seem to help. Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Hi all, I’m super happy to say that I’m on day 4 of not smoking/vaping and it’s been one of the best decisions ever! I’ve been smoking/vaping everyday since I was 15 (now 23). I feel like being high this whole time throughout high school &amp; college has caused me to miss out on so many opportunities in life as getting high just makes me super lazy and as someone once said, “getting high makes you feel OK with being OK” as in I was content with my average life and didn’t want to better myself.. another reason that made me officially quit was due to my eczema kicking in really bad whenever I’m high, which idk why it does but I’m guessing I must be allergic to it??    Thankfully, these past few days haven’t been too hard as I would expect it to since I’ve been occupying myself with learning and going to the gym! Also, the dreams have been super crazy!!    To those who are preparing to quit, YOU CAN DO IT!    Cheers everyone!

__label__0 I just started playing volleyball and I'm extremely passionate about the sport. I love every aspect of it but I'm having a hard time getting to higher balls when I'm either blocking or hitting. For reference Im 6.0ft tall (or 183cm) and i weigh about 180 pounds. My vertical isn't that impressive and I'm trying really hard to improve it. I used to work out at the gym and do 6 day splits and gained significant strength over time but im conflicted. I know im heavier than most athletes for my height and I dont know if I should focus on dropping 10-15 pounds or focus on getting stronger at the gym. I'm not quite sure which method would be more efficient. And advice?
__label__1 Has anyone managed to get WWE 2K Battlegrounds running smoothly on their Switch with custom firmware? I’ve been trying to get it to work, but I keep running into issues with the graphics and performance.     I’ve got the latest Atmosphere and all the necessary patches, but the game still stutters and crashes occasionally. I’ve tried different settings in the emulator, but nothing seems to help.     If anyone has tips or a working setup, I’d really appreciate it! Also, are there any specific mods or updates that I should be looking for to enhance the experience? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I co-parent with my ex, and we have a pretty solid agreement on our pick-up and drop-off times for our two kids (ages 7 and 9). We initially set these times during our divorce proceedings to ensure consistency for the kids, which I think is really important. However, I've noticed that my ex has been a bit inconsistent with these times lately, often showing up late or asking to change the schedule at the last minute.     For example, last week she was supposed to drop the kids off at 5 PM, but she didn’t arrive until 6 PM without any prior notice. This has been happening more frequently, and I’m starting to feel frustrated because it disrupts our routine and can be confusing for the kids.     I’ve tried to address it calmly by texting her about the importance of sticking to the agreed-upon times, but she often brushes it off or says she was caught up with something. I don’t want to escalate things, but I also want to make sure we’re both respecting the schedule we set for the kids’ sake.     Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I bring this up in our next co-parenting counseling session, or is there a better way to approach this? I really want to keep things amicable, but I also need to advocate for the kids’ stability.
__label__0 22 Female 155lbs 5’3”  Tennessee       Hi all,     I’m struggling with severe head pain. I was having a bit of weird brain fog, pins and needles, nausea, fatigue and moderate headaches over the last 5 days. I do suffer from chronic migraines, this is not the same. Well today, I woke up and had severe pain and suffering from head pressure as if my brain is swollen and needs to pop. If I press on a part of the back of my head, I get pins and needles in my head and face. I felt like I was in a dream-like state and was absolutely suffering, I was freaking out and my chest/breathing was tightened. I went to the ER scared I was having a stroke or aneurysm, but I had a CT scan and I was cleared of any abnormalities or bleeding. My vitals were checked and they were also cleared from being a cause. I swear what I am feeling is not normal!! I asked for a blood test in case I had an infection, nothing. I’m still suffering, 9 hours later. I’m not in severe pain since the ER gave me strong meds but I still feel a huge amount of pressure in my head, as if my brain is ready to jump out of my skull.   I’m not sure what’s going on.

__label__1 I keep seeing posts about people scrambling to submit their co-op applications at the last minute, and I just have to ask: who is advising you to do this?     I get it, life gets busy, and sometimes things slip through the cracks, but applying last minute can seriously hurt your chances of landing a good position. The co-op process is competitive, and employers are looking for candidates who show initiative and planning.     If you’re in a situation where you’re applying last minute, I highly recommend reaching out to your co-op advisor or peers who have successfully navigated the process. They can provide valuable insights and tips on how to improve your application quickly.     Also, don’t forget to utilize resources like resume workshops and mock interviews that the university offers. It’s never too late to polish your application, but starting early is key!     Let’s help each other out and share some strategies for staying on top of co-op applications next term!
__label__0 Originally, I had thought I’d worrier through a cold turkey, but after three days of no sleep and profound restlessness, altered mental cognition, I caved and began taking 3 grams at night to help me sleep per a kind Redditor’s advice.     After several years of impulsively scooping around 20 gpd of Kratom into my face everyday, I consider this an amazing achievement!    This may not be a conventional way to stop Kratom, but Jesus this has helped me! Otherwise, I’d probably had fully relapsed.     I’m on day 8, and it’s been extremely painful and difficult. I’m detoxing, sweating, whiny. I’m also exercising, hydrating, bundled, and whiny. But at night, I allow myself to stabilize slightly, enough to fall into a fitful slumber that almost resembles sleep.     Also…  The goosebumps from listening to music is AMAZING. My boyfriend touching me is AMAZING. My startling laughter is AMAZING. My emerging social tendency is AMAZING. My tears of sorrow and joy are AMAZING. My (extreme) dorkiness is AMAZING (my poor teenagers).     Let there be a place for this unconventional Kratom cessation. Anecdotally, this has helped me. I hope this may help you as well.     Namaste.

Networking with local professionals and checking job boards can provide additional insights into specific opportunities in these cities.
__label__1 I've been diving into the MyPlayer builder for NBA 2K24, and I have to say, it's a game-changer this year! The new features and options really allow for a more personalized experience.     I’m particularly excited about the new badge system. It feels like there’s a lot more flexibility in how we can build our players. I’ve been experimenting with a 6’7” shooting guard who can shoot lights out while still being able to hold his own defensively. I’m focusing on getting that three-point shot up while also investing in playmaking to create my own shots.     What are you all building this year? Any tips on badge combinations or attributes that you’ve found to be particularly effective? I’m also curious about how the height and weight adjustments are affecting gameplay. Let’s share our builds and strategies!     Also, has anyone tried the new animations? I’m looking for recommendations on dribble moves and shooting styles that fit well with a guard build. Can’t wait to hear what you all think!

Can anyone help me with an estimate? I’d love to know if it’s worth keeping or if I should consider selling it. Any tips on where to get it appraised would also be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been diving deep into the Dark Tower series lately, and I can't help but think about how music can enhance the experience of reading these epic novels. I wanted to share some playlists I've created that I think capture the essence of Roland's journey and the themes throughout the series.     1. **The Gunslinger Playlist**: This one features a mix of classic rock and folk music that evokes the desolate landscapes of Mid-World. Think of artists like Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and some tracks from the soundtrack of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" to really set the mood.    2. **The Drawing of the Three Playlist**: For this playlist, I focused on songs that reflect the chaotic and diverse nature of the characters Roland meets. A blend of alternative rock and hip-hop, with tracks from artists like The Clash, Eminem, and even some haunting melodies from Hozier.    3. **The Wastelands Playlist**: This one is darker and more atmospheric, featuring post-apocalyptic themes. Bands like Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, and some instrumental pieces from Hans Zimmer really capture the feeling of despair and hope that permeates this part of the series.    4. **Wizard and Glass Playlist**: A more romantic and nostalgic vibe here, with songs that reflect Roland's past and his love for Susan. Think of softer rock and indie music, with artists like Fleetwood Mac, Iron & Wine, and Sufjan Stevens.    5. **Song of Susannah and The Dark Tower Playlist**: This final playlist is a mix of everything, capturing the urgency and epic nature of the final battles. It includes orchestral pieces, rock anthems, and even some electronic music to reflect the blend of worlds. Artists like Muse, The Prodigy, and some tracks from movie soundtracks like "Inception" fit perfectly.    I’d love to hear your thoughts on these playlists! What songs do you think would fit well with the Dark Tower series? Do you have any playlists of your own that you listen to while reading? Let’s share and create the ultimate Dark Tower soundtrack together!

__label__1 "Especially In Michigan" is such a hauntingly beautiful track. The way Anthony Kiedis delivers the lyrics really captures that sense of longing and nostalgia. The imagery he paints about the cold, desolate landscapes of Michigan resonates deeply, especially for those of us who have experienced the harsh winters there.     Musically, the blend of John Frusciante's guitar work and Flea's bass lines creates this atmospheric sound that perfectly complements the lyrics. It’s a bit different from their more upbeat tracks, but that’s what I love about the Chili Peppers – they can evoke such a wide range of emotions through their music.     I also appreciate how the song reflects on themes of love and loss, which is something many of us can relate to. It’s a reminder of how places can hold memories and feelings that linger long after we’ve left.     What do you all think? Does this song hit you in the feels as much as it does for me?

__label__1 I think we can all agree that rock bottom is a place we never want to visit, but sometimes it feels like a rite of passage. I hit my own version of rock bottom a few years ago when I lost my job, went through a breakup, and found myself in a deep depression. It felt like everything I had worked for was crumbling around me, and I was just stuck in this cycle of self-pity and despair.    But here’s the thing: hitting rock bottom can be a catalyst for change. For me, it forced me to confront my demons and take a hard look at my life. I started by seeking therapy, which was a game changer. Talking to someone who could help me untangle my thoughts and feelings was incredibly liberating. I also began to focus on my physical health—started exercising, eating better, and even picked up meditation.     I realized that I had to take small steps to rebuild my life. I started volunteering, which not only helped me feel connected to others but also gave me a sense of purpose. Slowly but surely, I began to regain my confidence. I took a few online courses to learn new skills, which eventually led to a new job that I actually love.     Looking back, I can see that rock bottom was a necessary part of my journey. It taught me resilience and the importance of self-care. I’m curious to hear from others—what was your rock bottom moment, and how did you manage to turn things around? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I’m playing Three Houses for the first time myself. Previously I watched my wife’s playthrough as the Blue Lions, so I decided to go with the Black Eagles this go around. If there’s any advice on builds y’all think I could benefit from please tell me. However, one thing I absolutely need to know how to do is recruit Lysithea and get her to her little nuke status. When watching the final battle between the three houses in my wife’s playthrough, Lysithea was absolutely wrecking everything she touched and just deleting people from the board. My goal this go is to have Hubert, Edelgard, and Lysithea in their most OP forms then to figure out the best builds for the rest. Any ideas on how to do just that?

I know that the rates can be pretty low, but I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same issue or if there are any tips to increase my chances of getting these LTDs.    I've been focusing on the specific dungeons that feature these monsters, but it feels like I'm just getting a lot of duplicates or lower-tier monsters instead. Is there a specific strategy or team composition that might help improve my luck?     Also, are there any particular LTDs that are considered must-haves right now? I want to make sure I'm not missing out on any game-changing characters.     Thanks in advance for any advice or insights!
__label__1 I'm looking to create a unique cosplay screen name that reflects my personality and interests. I love anime, video games, and fantasy themes, and I want something catchy and memorable. Any suggestions? Maybe something that combines elements from my favorite characters or genres? I appreciate any ideas you can share!
__label__1 It's crazy to think that the anniversary of "Astroworld" is coming up and Travis hasn't dropped any teasers or posts about it yet. Usually, he’s all about the hype and building up the excitement for his projects. I mean, this album was such a cultural moment and it feels like he’s been pretty quiet lately.     Do you think he’s planning something big for the anniversary, or is he just taking a different approach this time? Maybe he’s working on new music and wants to keep the focus there? I’d love to hear what everyone thinks!     Also, what are your favorite tracks from "Astroworld"? Let’s reminisce about this masterpiece!
__label__1 As we all know, the sibling dynamic in Genshin Impact is a hot topic among fans! With Lumine and Aether both having their unique strengths and storylines, it’s hard to pick a favorite.     Lumine, the female protagonist, has a strong connection to the Anemo and Geo elements, and her character design is just stunning! Plus, her interactions with other characters often showcase her determination and resilience. On the other hand, Aether, the male protagonist, has his own charm and is often seen as more laid-back, which can be refreshing in the heat of battle.     Some players prefer Lumine for her fierce personality and the way she stands up for her friends, while others lean towards Aether for his calm demeanor and the way he navigates the world with a sense of curiosity.     What do you all think? Who do you believe is the better sibling and why? Let’s discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and how they impact the story of Genshin Impact!
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m looking to invest in some workout equipment for my home gym and I thought I’d ask for your recommendations on what to buy from Amazon. I’m trying to create a versatile setup that allows me to do a variety of workouts, including strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises.     Here’s what I’m considering so far:  1. **Adjustable Dumbbells** - I’ve seen a lot of options, but I want something that’s compact and easy to adjust.  2. **Resistance Bands** - I think these are great for adding variety to workouts and they don’t take up much space.  3. **Yoga Mat** - For stretching and floor exercises, I want something with good grip and cushioning.  4. **Kettlebell** - I’ve heard kettlebells are great for full-body workouts, but I’m not sure what weight to start with.  5. **Pull-Up Bar** - I’d love to incorporate pull-ups into my routine, but I need a bar that can fit in my doorway.    If you have any specific products you love or think I should avoid, please let me know! Also, if there are any other pieces of equipment you think are essential for a home gym, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've recently started exploring the SWIFT model (Structured Writing Instruction for Focused Teaching) in my classroom, and I'm curious if anyone else has experience with it.     For those who might not be familiar, the SWIFT model emphasizes structured writing instruction that helps students develop their writing skills in a more focused and systematic way. It breaks down the writing process into manageable steps, which I find particularly helpful for my students who struggle with writing.     I've been implementing it in my 5th-grade class, and I've noticed that my students are becoming more confident in their writing abilities. We start with brainstorming ideas, then move on to organizing those ideas into an outline, and finally, we draft and revise. I also incorporate peer reviews, which has been a great way for them to learn from each other.     However, I’m still figuring out how to best adapt the model for different learning styles and needs. I’d love to hear from others who have used the SWIFT model. What strategies have worked for you? Have you faced any challenges? Any tips on how to make it even more effective in the classroom?     Looking forward to your insights!
__label__1 I've been trying to troubleshoot some connectivity issues on my network, and I suspect it might be related to the order of my firewall rules in the UDM Pro.     Currently, I have the following rules set up:  1. Allow all traffic from the LAN to the WAN  2. Block all traffic from the WAN to the LAN  3. Allow specific ports for a couple of services (like SSH and HTTP) from the WAN to the LAN  4. Allow traffic between VLANs    I’ve noticed that some devices on my LAN are having trouble accessing certain services, and I’m wondering if the order of these rules could be causing the issue.     Is there a best practice for ordering firewall rules in the UDM Pro? Should I be placing the specific allow rules before the general block rule? Any advice on how to properly structure these rules would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I’m sure you guys are sick of seeing things about the 30 series cards but I’m thinking about getting the 3070 but I don’t wanna get it if I’m not gonna be seeing most of the performance that it brings, I currently have a rx 580 and a 144 hz monitor I play games like rocket league which I get great performance on but then games like call of duty or some bigger story games I’d like better performance. Should I go for it or should I wait till I have a better monitor.

__label__1 I've been playing through Dragon Age: Inquisition with an Elven Inquisitor, and I wanted to share my plotline and get some feedback or suggestions for improvement!     My character, Aeliana, is a Dalish mage who has always felt a strong connection to the Fade and the spirits within it. I decided to lean into her heritage and make choices that reflect her desire to protect her people and restore their lost culture.     1. **Background Choices**: I chose the Dalish background, which has influenced many of my interactions. I love how it adds depth to her character, especially when dealing with the Qunari and the other elves.     2. **Romance**: I went for Solas as a romance option. Their relationship has been so intriguing, especially with the tension between his goals and her desire to unite the elves. The conversations about the Fade and the nature of the spirits have been some of my favorites.     3. **Key Decisions**: I made sure to support the Dalish clans whenever possible. I helped the Dalish in the Hinterlands and made a point to side with them during the conflict with the Qunari. I also chose to save the Elven artifacts in the Temple of Mythal, believing that preserving their history is crucial for the future of the elves.     4. **The Dread Wolf**: I’ve been really fascinated by the lore surrounding Solas and the Dread Wolf. I’ve tried to keep an open mind about his intentions, even as I grapple with the implications of his actions. I think Aeliana sees the potential for a new future for the elves, but she’s also wary of the cost.     5. **Ending Choices**: As I approach the endgame, I’m torn between supporting Solas in his quest to restore the elven people to their former glory and the potential consequences that could have for the world. I want to find a way to balance the needs of all races while honoring her heritage.     Overall, I feel like Aeliana’s journey has been a powerful exploration of identity, culture, and the complexities of leadership. I’d love to hear your thoughts on my choices and any suggestions for how to navigate the final chapters! What have your experiences been like with an Elven Inquisitor?

__label__1 I just came across this post in a group chat and I can't believe how infuriating it is. Someone is actually trying to trade pictures of their "hot 18-year-old aunt" for other pictures. Like, what kind of person thinks this is okay? Not only is it super creepy, but it also raises so many red flags about consent and respect for family members. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that people think this is a normal thing to do. It’s mildly infuriating to see how some people have such a lack of boundaries.
__label__1 I’m so tired of the narrative that only women experience sexual assault and harassment. Yes, women face a significant amount of it, and it’s absolutely horrific, but let’s not pretend that men don’t also suffer from these issues.     I’m a man, and I’ve experienced unwanted advances, inappropriate comments, and even physical harassment. It’s infuriating to see the conversation around sexual assault so heavily focused on women, as if men are somehow immune to it or that our experiences don’t matter.     When I try to talk about my experiences, I often get dismissed or told that I should just "man up" or that it’s not as serious as what women go through. This kind of attitude is damaging and perpetuates the stigma that men can’t be victims. It’s not a competition; we should be supporting each other in this fight against sexual violence, regardless of gender.     I’ve seen countless stories of men who have been assaulted, and yet the media and society often overlook these cases. It’s frustrating to feel like I have to fight for my voice to be heard in a conversation that should be inclusive of everyone.     We need to acknowledge that sexual assault and harassment can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. It’s time to broaden the conversation and create a safe space for all victims to share their stories without fear of judgment or dismissal. Let’s work together to end this epidemic, not just for women, but for everyone.

__label__1 I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 11, and now I'm experiencing some major issues. The laptop is a Dell XPS 15 (model 9570) and it was running Windows 10 perfectly before the upgrade.     After the upgrade, the laptop frequently freezes and becomes unresponsive, especially when I try to use multiple applications at once. I've also noticed that the battery drains much faster than it did before, even when I'm not using it heavily.     I've tried the following troubleshooting steps:  1. Updated all drivers from the Dell support website.  2. Checked for Windows updates and installed the latest patches.  3. Ran the built-in Windows troubleshooter for performance issues.  4. Disabled unnecessary startup programs.  5. Reset the power settings to default.    Despite these efforts, the problems persist. I'm not sure if it's a compatibility issue with Windows 11 or if there's something else going on.     Has anyone else experienced similar issues after upgrading to Windows 11? Any suggestions on what I can do to resolve these problems? Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Hi People,     I am a guy with 50 hours a week job and mental health issues.     I also have a camera and want to learn photography and editing.     I have watched hundreds of videos, finished courses on Photoshop and can do minor jobs like retouching, blendings two photos together, make selections etc.     I know the technical part and I can learn more from Youtube.     I want to learn the concept part of arts, photography, and post processing. I want to come up with an idea before taking the photo and starting the editing process.     I want to be a thinking photographer not a casual snapper or 'presets dependent photo editor'.     I wish to make conscious decisions before doing things like enhancing shadows, highlights or colour grading photos.        I would love to read some books on art which establishes the concept, make me think and turn me into a knowledgeable person with a camera.     I want to create meaning with my photos for people. I want to communicate.    Kindly help.

__label__1 If you're looking to trade items in Elden Ring, there are a few methods you can use to find other players willing to engage in trades. Here are some suggestions:    1. **Subreddits and Forums**: The Elden Ring subreddit (/r/EldenRing) is a great place to start. You can create a post specifically asking for trades or check out existing threads where players are looking to trade items. Other forums like the official Bandai Namco forums or gaming communities on Discord can also be useful.    2. **Discord Servers**: There are several Discord servers dedicated to Elden Ring where players often organize trades. You can find servers by searching for "Elden Ring trading" on Discord or through Reddit. These servers usually have dedicated channels for trading, making it easy to connect with others.    3. **In-Game Messaging**: If you encounter players in the game, you can use the in-game messaging system to communicate. You can leave messages near summoning signs or in areas where you know players gather, like the Roundtable Hold, to express your interest in trading.    4. **Social Media**: Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have groups and hashtags dedicated to Elden Ring. You can post your trade requests there or join groups where players are actively trading.    5. **Community Events**: Keep an eye out for community events or trading days organized by players. These events can be a fun way to meet other players and trade items in a more structured environment.    Remember to be cautious when trading, as not everyone may have good intentions. Happy trading!
__label__1 If you're a fan of Danganronpa and Mirai Nikki (Future Diary), you might be looking for anime that feature psychological thrills, survival games, and intense character dynamics. Here are some recommendations that capture similar themes:    1. **Akame ga Kill!** - This series follows a group of assassins fighting against a corrupt empire. It has a dark tone, unexpected character deaths, and moral dilemmas that keep you on the edge of your seat.    2. **The Future Diary (Mirai Nikki)** - If you enjoyed Mirai Nikki, you might want to check out the manga or the anime again for its unique storytelling and character development. The intense survival game aspect is a major draw.    3. **Another** - A horror mystery that revolves around a cursed class and a series of gruesome deaths. The atmosphere is tense, and the plot twists will keep you guessing.    4. **Paranoia Agent** - This psychological thriller delves into the minds of its characters as they deal with a mysterious assailant. It explores themes of fear and societal pressure, much like the psychological aspects of Danganronpa.    5. **Deadman Wonderland** - Set in a prison where inmates are forced to participate in deadly games for entertainment, this series combines action, horror, and psychological elements, making it a gripping watch.    6. **The Promised Neverland** - This anime features children trying to escape from an orphanage with a dark secret. The suspense and strategic planning are reminiscent of the survival elements in Danganronpa.    7. **Steins;Gate** - While it leans more towards sci-fi, the psychological elements and character development are top-notch. The story revolves around time travel and its consequences, with plenty of twists and turns.    8. **Guilty Crown** - This series features a dystopian world where a young man gains the power to extract weapons from others. It has a mix of action, romance, and psychological elements that fans of Danganronpa might enjoy.    These series should satisfy your craving for intense plots and complex characters. What are some of your favorite moments from Danganronpa or Mirai Nikki? Let's discuss!

__label__1 I recently had a minor procedure that involved some shave incisions, and I went to a dermatologist for aftercare advice. Unfortunately, I feel like the advice I received was not very helpful, and I'm a bit worried about how to properly care for my skin during the healing process.    The derm told me to keep the area clean and dry, which I understand, but they didn't give me any specific recommendations on what products to use or how often to clean the area. They also mentioned that I should avoid any creams or ointments, which seems counterintuitive since I’ve read that keeping the skin moisturized can help with healing.    I’m currently using a gentle cleanser, but I’m unsure if I should be applying anything else, like a healing ointment or a moisturizer. I’ve also read about the benefits of using silicone gel sheets for scars, but I’m not sure if that’s appropriate for fresh incisions.    Has anyone else had a similar experience? What products or routines have worked for you in healing shave incisions? Any advice on what to do (or what to avoid) would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

__label__1 I (28F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for about two years now. Overall, things are good, but there’s one thing that’s been bothering me lately, and I’m struggling to not let it affect my mood.     My boyfriend has a very demanding job that often requires him to work long hours and be on call. I completely understand that his work is important and that he has to prioritize it, but it often leaves me feeling neglected and unimportant. When he’s busy, he tends to be less communicative, and I find myself feeling anxious and lonely.     I’ve tried to talk to him about it, and he reassures me that it’s not personal and that he cares about me, but when I don’t hear from him for hours or even days, it’s hard not to feel like I’m not a priority in his life. I know he’s working hard for our future, but I can’t help but feel a bit resentful and sad when I see other couples spending time together or being more connected.     I want to be supportive and understanding, but I also don’t want to let this situation bring me down. I’ve been trying to find ways to cope, like focusing on my hobbies, spending time with friends, and practicing self-care, but I still find myself feeling low when he’s unavailable.     How can I better manage my feelings and not let his work schedule affect my mood? I want to be happy and supportive, but I also need to take care of my own emotional well-being. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I am asking this question for my cousin. I already had my forgiveness and already consolidated so this wasn't relevant to me at the time.     What is the current interest rate for consolidating loans? Or how would she go about finding that out? She only has 36 payments and has been doing Income driven but her loans aren't consolidated. The loans counts for her various loans are close enough to 36 and her rates are between high 5s and lows 7s. She's wondering if it makes sense to consolidate and apply for the waiver.
__label__1 If you're looking to unlock more weapons in Team Fortress 2, there are several methods you can use! Here’s a quick guide to help you get started:    1. **Achievements**: Many weapons are unlocked by completing specific achievements. Each class has its own set of achievements that, when completed, will reward you with a new weapon. You can check the achievements menu in-game to see what you need to do for each class.    2. **Crafting**: You can craft weapons using the crafting system. If you have duplicate weapons or items you don’t want, you can break them down into crafting materials and then use those materials to create new weapons. You can also craft weapons directly if you have the required items.    3. **Trading**: If you have friends or other players who are willing to trade, you can exchange items to get the weapons you want. Just be sure to check the value of the items you’re trading to ensure a fair exchange.    4. **Special Events**: Keep an eye out for special events or seasonal updates. Sometimes, Valve releases limited-time weapons or items that can only be obtained during these events.    5. **Mann Co. Store**: You can also purchase weapons directly from the Mann Co. Store using real money or in-game currency. This is a straightforward way to get specific weapons if you don’t want to grind for them.    6. **Community Servers**: Some community servers have custom game modes that allow you to unlock weapons more quickly or even give you access to all weapons right away. Just be sure to check the server rules and settings.    Remember, the best way to enjoy TF2 is to experiment with different classes and weapons, so don’t hesitate to try out new things as you unlock them! Happy gaming!

Players can make their favorite countries/nations/empires from history or make something entirely new.    **Make Ships that Sail and Planes that Fly**    Total War uses the Movecraft plugin, which allows players to make vehicles that sail, fly, and ride around the world. Make your favorite battleships and airplanes, and equip them with cannons from the cannons plugin or TNT cannons. Then, use your creations to wreak havoc in battle.    **Plugins Designed By Owner**    Total War’s owner is taking the opportunity to improve his programming skills and his Minecraft server at the same time. He already has one custom plugin on the server (WBplugin) and is on his way to coding more. Expect this server to improve over time as he adds new plugins with exciting features.     **Minimal Rules**    The owner of Total War understands that large lists of rules can get in the way of the players' enjoyment. Therefore, the server is using a bare-bones set of rules that make it both easy to play and easy to administrate.    &amp;#x200B;    1. Respect the admins  2. Do not undermine the server (hack, dupe spam, etc.)  3. Alt accounts are not allowed  4. Have fun!    **Join Today!**     Join our discord to get whitelisted.

__label__1 I've been trying to figure out how to play with classic teams in NBA 2K, but I'm not sure where to start. I remember some of the older games had a feature where you could select legendary teams like the 1996 Bulls or the 2000 Lakers, but I can't seem to find that option in the latest version.     Is there a specific mode I need to go into, or do I have to unlock them somehow? Also, are there any tips for playing with these teams, like strategies or play styles that work best?     Thanks in advance for any help!
__label__1 I have a 2-year-old cat named Whiskers who has recently developed some "bad" behaviors that I’m trying to manage. He’s always been a bit of a handful, but lately, he’s taken to knocking things off tables and shelves, especially when he’s bored or wants attention. I’ve tried to redirect him with toys, but he seems to lose interest quickly.    I’m looking for suggestions on how to manage his behavior without resorting to punishment. I’ve heard that providing more engaging toys can help, but I’m not sure what types of toys would keep him entertained.     I’ve tried feather wands and balls, but he seems to prefer things that he can bat around or chase. I’m considering getting some interactive toys or puzzle feeders to stimulate his mind.     What toys have you found to be the most effective for your cats? Also, any tips on how to discourage the knocking things over behavior would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 Hey everyone!    I’m a 29-year-old guy looking to spice things up a bit in my relationship. My partner and I are interested in finding a unicorn to join us for some fun and adventure. We’re both open-minded, respectful, and excited to explore new experiences together.      A little about us: we’re a loving couple who enjoy traveling, trying new foods, and having deep conversations. We’re looking for someone who is confident, fun, and comfortable in their own skin. Ideally, you should be someone who enjoys both intimate moments and just hanging out, whether it’s watching movies or going out for drinks.      If you’re interested in chatting and seeing if we vibe, feel free to reach out! We’d love to get to know you better and see where things go.      Looking forward to hearing from you!

__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with Fortnite lately. Every time I try to join a match, I get stuck on the loading screen and eventually get kicked back to the main menu with an error message. I've tried restarting my game, checking for updates, and even reinstalling, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced this? If so, do you have any tips or solutions that worked for you? I really want to get back into the game and enjoy the new season! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 It’s been a little over seven months ago since we’ve been broken up and in no contact. I haven’t seen her or talked to her at all since then.    She’s had me blocked on all platforms including my number. However I noticed that she recently unblocked me on iG and TT. I didn’t reach out and stayed in no contact only to find out that she blocked me again.    I don’t have any intentions to get back with her nor to break no contact but I’m curious to know what game is she playing and what her reasonings behind this are?
__label__0 I want to start Suboxone again after a relapse. I’m afraid of the withdrawals and want to do it as comfortable as possible. I went to a detox in April and am going to get Suboxone from a website. Originally in the detox I’m pretty sure they hit me with about 12mg of Suboxone and tapered me each day. They made me wait over 30 hours before taking it because my pills have fetanyl in them. Sadly I’m back on it and want to get off.     I want to know if I can take about 12mg instantly after like 20 hours as opposed to either waiting nearly 48 hours (as recommended when fetanyl is in the system). This also goes against what I’ve been reading online which is take 2mg and if you start precipitated withdrawing then take another 2mg every 30min to an hour. Would taking 12mg instead of 2mg prevent precipitated withdrawals?     Really appreciate any feedback. Please help me get off this crap
__label__1 I feel like "Everything Will Be Alright In The End" often gets overshadowed by some of Weezer's earlier work, but it really deserves more love! The album has such a great mix of catchy hooks and deeper themes. Songs like "Ain't Got Nobody" and "Cleopatra" showcase Rivers' songwriting at its best, blending humor with introspection. Plus, the concept of the album, with the whole "return to form" vibe, is just so well executed.     I also love how it captures that classic Weezer sound while still feeling fresh and relevant. The production is top-notch, and the guitar work is fantastic.     What do you all think? Do you agree that this album is underrated? What are your favorite tracks from it?
__label__1 I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts on the recent event in Escape from Tarkov. Overall, I think it’s been a mixed bag, but there are definitely some highlights worth discussing.    First off, the new map changes have really shaken things up. I love how the developers are constantly tweaking the environment to keep us on our toes. The addition of new loot spots and extraction points has made every raid feel fresh, and I’ve found myself exploring areas I usually avoid. It’s a great way to encourage players to adapt their strategies.    However, I do have some concerns about the balance of the event. It seems like some of the new gear and weapons are a bit overpowered, especially in the hands of players who know how to use them effectively. I’ve been on the receiving end of some pretty frustrating encounters where it feels like I didn’t stand a chance. I hope the devs are keeping an eye on this and will make adjustments as needed.    On the positive side, the community engagement during this event has been fantastic. I’ve seen a lot of players sharing tips and strategies on how to tackle the new challenges, and it’s great to see everyone coming together to help each other out. The camaraderie in Tarkov is one of the things I love most about the game.    In conclusion, while there are some aspects of the event that could use improvement, I appreciate the effort the developers are putting into keeping the game dynamic and engaging. I’m looking forward to seeing how things evolve in the coming weeks. What do you all think? Have you enjoyed the event so far, or do you have any frustrations you'd like to share?
__label__1 I recently came across this unusual leaf mutation in my grow tent, and I’m not sure what to make of it. The plant is a Blue Dream, and it has developed these strange, twisted leaves that almost look like they’re curling in on themselves.     I’ve checked for pests and diseases, and everything seems fine. The plant is otherwise healthy, with good growth and no signs of nutrient deficiencies. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar or if this is a common mutation.     I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 That caught your attention lol. Been here since January, short staffed. We never work less than 50 hours, not just talking during month or quarter end. I’m done, got a new job, more $, gave my 2 weeks     I want to being a cake next week. As a manager I had approached my boss a few times letting her know we need another Jr in our team bc we can’t operate as we did before, as we have too many new people (had a 3 quite at end of 1Q22 when company announced we were going back to office 100%).     She’s always insisting “these are 40-45 hour roles”; that’s never happened, not even with the few seasoned people left.     Anyway I want to write a message (maybe a little sarcasm lol) on the cake addressing the “40 hours” lol. I need ideas.     I was thinking something like:    The “never 40 hr crew”. I don’t know, simple, but not insulting in any way, but definitely I want to deliver my point.
__label__1 I recently came across a post that was removed for promoting hate, and I'm struggling to understand how it fits that description. The content seemed to express a strong opinion about a particular group, but I didn't see any direct calls for violence or discrimination.     Can someone help clarify what specific elements in a post can be considered hate speech? Are there certain phrases or themes that are more likely to be flagged? I want to better understand the guidelines and ensure that I’m not inadvertently supporting harmful content. Any insights or examples would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the desire for fame among young people today. It seems like everywhere you look, there are influencers, TikTok stars, and YouTube personalities who have gained massive followings in a short amount of time. But why is this phenomenon so appealing, especially when we know that fame can be fleeting and often comes with its own set of challenges?    One reason might be the visibility of fame in our society. With social media, young people are constantly exposed to the glamorous lives of celebrities and influencers. This can create a perception that fame equates to happiness, success, and validation. Many young people might believe that if they can achieve fame, they will also achieve a sense of worth and belonging.    Additionally, the rise of platforms like Instagram and TikTok has made it easier than ever for anyone to gain a following. This accessibility can lead to the idea that fame is attainable, which can be incredibly motivating. The idea of going viral or becoming an overnight sensation can be very enticing, especially for those who may feel overlooked in their everyday lives.    Moreover, the culture of instant gratification plays a significant role. In a world where everything is available at our fingertips, the idea of achieving fame quickly can be very appealing. Young people may not fully consider the long-term implications of fame, such as the pressure to maintain an image or the potential for negative scrutiny.    Lastly, there’s the aspect of influence. Many young people want to be famous not just for the sake of being known, but to have a platform to share their ideas, creativity, or causes they care about. They may see fame as a way to make a difference or inspire others, which can be a powerful motivator.    What do you all think? Is the desire for fame among young people driven more by societal pressures, personal aspirations, or something else entirely?
__label__1 I’ve just received notice that my landlord is selling the flat I’ve been living in for the past three years. I’m absolutely dreading the thought of house hunting in this market.     First of all, the sheer amount of paperwork and fees involved is enough to make anyone want to throw in the towel. And don’t even get me started on the viewings! I can’t stand the awkward small talk with estate agents who seem to think I’m going to pay £1,500 a month for a shoebox with a view of a brick wall.     Then there’s the added stress of trying to find a place that’s not in a dodgy area or too far from work. I’ve got my heart set on a nice little neighbourhood, but I know I’ll probably end up in a flat share with a bunch of strangers who think it’s okay to leave dirty dishes in the sink for days.     And of course, there’s the inevitable panic about whether I’ll be able to afford the rent, especially with the cost of living going up. I just want a nice, quiet place to call home without the constant worry of being priced out.     Anyone else in the same boat? How do you cope with the stress of moving? Any tips for finding a decent place without losing your mind?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm pretty new to airsoft and just got my first LiPo battery. I was wondering if anyone here uses an RC battery charger for their LiPos? I’ve seen some chargers that are specifically made for airsoft batteries, but I already have an RC charger that can handle LiPo batteries.     Is it safe to use it for charging my airsoft LiPos, or should I invest in a dedicated airsoft charger? I want to make sure I’m not risking any damage to the battery or my gear. Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Right lads, I had a bit of a tip coming home from work a few weeks back. I rear ended someone and thankfully everyone was alright, claim is still open and insurance companies are dealing with it.       Fast forward to today and I get a letter from the guards in the post, it’s a Fixed Charge Notice for 2 penalty points and an €80 fine for “Driving without reasonable consideration”. When the guards arrived on scene they didn’t take statements or anything they just asked if we needed a tow and then said that it’s a civil matter as no one was hurt and just told us to exchange details.     Should I try fighting this claim or just take the hit, I’m 21 so penalty points will probably hurt the ol’ insurance premium.    Edit: I'll add the fact that i was actually going under the speed limit and wasn't acting the maggot or any boy racer shite.

__label__0 My ex is abusive and I have proof and witnesses.  left because I unexpectedly got pregnant with a  second child and he told me if I didn't get an  abortion we were done. We have a 16 month old.  He left to New York and has threatened to keep  her in New York and file for custody there. I told  him until we make an agreement he can still see  her if someone else is preset due to the verbal  and physical abuse, I had already filed for  custody. He refused to make an agreement until I  dropped the custody case…. I sent him a text on a  co parenting app and on text message asking if  he wanted to see her before he left. He NEVER  RESPONDED. But read both messages. In his  counter claim he said that I attempted suicide and  was severely mentally ill - NOT TRUE - and that I  am withholding out child but he has NOT reached  out in over 8 weeks. Am I at risk of losing custody  of my child?

__label__1 The Grafted Scion is definitely a memorable first boss encounter in Elden Ring, but whether it's a "good" first boss can be subjective. On one hand, it serves as a great introduction to the game's combat mechanics and the brutal difficulty that players can expect throughout their journey. The Scion's aggressive attacks and multiple limbs can catch new players off guard, making it a challenging fight right from the start.    However, some players might find it frustrating, especially if they are not familiar with the Souls-like mechanics of dodging and timing. The encounter can feel punishing, and for those who are new to the genre, it might deter them from continuing the game.     That said, many players appreciate the challenge and the sense of accomplishment that comes from defeating such a formidable foe early on. It sets the tone for the rest of the game and encourages players to learn from their mistakes.     In conclusion, while the Grafted Scion can be a tough first boss, it also provides a thrilling experience that many players enjoy. What do you all think? Is it a fitting introduction to the world of Elden Ring, or should there have been a different first boss?
__label__1 As a recent graduate in the UK, I’m seeking advice on how to navigate the job market effectively. I have a degree in chemistry and am particularly interested in roles within the pharmaceutical or environmental sectors.     I’ve been applying for various positions, but I’m not getting many responses. I’ve tailored my CV and cover letters for each application, but I feel like I might be missing something crucial.     Here are a few specific questions I have:  1. What are the best platforms or websites to find graduate jobs in chemistry?  2. How important is networking in this field, and what are some effective ways to network?  3. Are there any specific skills or experiences that employers in the chemistry sector are looking for that I should focus on developing?  4. Should I consider internships or temporary positions to gain experience, even if they are not my ideal job?    Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__1 I recently stumbled upon some early illustrations of familiar spots in Los Angeles from 1935, and I just had to share! It's amazing to see how much the city has changed over the decades while still retaining some of its iconic landmarks.     The illustrations capture places like the old Griffith Park Observatory, which looks so different now, and the original Farmers Market at 3rd and Fairfax, which has evolved into a bustling hub of food and culture.     I love how these artworks give a glimpse into the past, showcasing the architecture and vibe of LA during that era. It’s a reminder of the rich history we have here.     If anyone is interested, I can share some links to the images or discuss more about the history of these locations. What are some of your favorite historical spots in LA? Let’s reminisce together!
__label__1 In a shocking turn of events at the St. Louis Chess Cup, a player has been accused of using anal beads as a high-tech cheating device during the tournament. Sources close to the event report that the player, who has not been named, was seen making suspicious movements and adjusting their seating position frequently, leading to speculation about the unusual strategy.    Witnesses claim that the player appeared to be receiving signals from an accomplice outside the venue, with the beads allegedly vibrating to indicate optimal moves. "I thought it was just a new way to get comfortable while playing, but then I noticed the player was making some very unorthodox decisions that seemed to defy logic," said one shocked spectator.    Tournament officials have launched an investigation, stating that they are taking the allegations seriously. "We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating, and if these claims are substantiated, we will take appropriate action," said the tournament director.     Meanwhile, the accused player has vehemently denied the allegations, claiming that the beads were merely a personal comfort item. "I just like to keep things interesting, you know?" they stated in a press conference, adding, "I thought everyone was doing it."    As the chess community grapples with this scandal, many are left wondering if this is the beginning of a new era in competitive chess, where players might need to rethink their strategies both on and off the board.     In related news, a new line of chess-themed anal beads has reportedly been flying off the shelves, with enthusiasts eager to get in on the action.
__label__1 I've been considering using Reddit as a platform to promote my podcast, but I'm a bit hesitant. I've seen some podcasts gain traction through Reddit, but I also know that self-promotion can be frowned upon in many subreddits.

Also, how did you balance engaging with the community while promoting your show? I want to make sure I’m contributing value and not just spamming links. Any tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Baseball and cricket are both bat-and-ball sports, but they have distinct rules and gameplay. Here’s a breakdown of baseball explained in cricketing terms:    1. **Pitcher = Bowler**: In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the ball to the batter. In cricket, the bowler delivers the ball to the batsman. Both roles are crucial for their respective teams, as they aim to get the opposing players out.    2. **Batter = Batsman**: The batter in baseball is similar to the batsman in cricket. The objective for both is to hit the ball and score runs. In baseball, the batter tries to hit the ball into play, while in cricket, the batsman aims to hit the ball to score runs or defend their wicket.    3. **Home Plate = Wicket**: In baseball, the home plate is where the batter stands and where they must run to score a run. In cricket, the wicket is the target that the bowler aims to hit, and the batsman defends it to avoid getting out.    4. **Bases = Runs**: In baseball, players run around bases to score runs. In cricket, players run between the wickets to accumulate runs after hitting the ball. Each completed run is similar to a player reaching a base in baseball.    5. **Outs = Dismissals**: In baseball, a player can be out in several ways, such as being struck out or caught. In cricket, players can be dismissed through various methods, including being bowled, caught, or run out. Both sports have a limit on how many outs or dismissals a team can have before their turn ends.    6. **Innings**: In baseball, each team has a turn to bat and field in each inning. In cricket, an innings is the period in which one team bats, and the other bowls and fields. A cricket match can have one or two innings per team, depending on the format.    7. **Strike Zone = Line of Off-Stump**: In baseball, the strike zone is the area where the batter can hit the ball. In cricket, the line of off-stump is where the batsman must defend against deliveries that are aimed at the stumps. If the ball is outside this line, the batsman can choose not to play a shot.    8. **Foul Ball = No Ball**: In baseball, a foul ball is a hit that lands outside the fair territory. In cricket, a no ball is an illegal delivery that allows the batsman to score an extra run and face a free hit.    9. **Fielding Positions**: Both sports have specific fielding positions, but they differ in names and roles. In baseball, you have positions like shortstop and outfielders, while in cricket, you have slips, gully, and mid-off, among others.    10. **Scoring Runs**: In baseball, runs are scored by players touching all four bases. In cricket, runs are scored by running between the wickets after hitting the ball or by hitting boundaries (4s and 6s).    In summary, while baseball and cricket share some similarities as bat-and-ball games, they have unique rules and gameplay that set them apart. Understanding these parallels can help cricket fans appreciate the nuances of baseball and vice versa.
__label__1 In a clash of two formidable factions from the Star Wars and Halo universes, we have Death Watch, the Mandalorian splinter group, taking on the Banished, the ruthless faction formed from the remnants of the Covenant. Let's break down the strengths and weaknesses of each side to determine who would emerge victorious in this epic showdown.    **Death Watch**:  - **Background**: A militant group of Mandalorians who seek to restore the old ways of their people, often using ruthless tactics and advanced technology.  - **Strengths**:    - **Combat Training**: Death Watch warriors are highly trained in hand-to-hand combat and proficient with a variety of weapons, including blasters and melee weapons.    - **Mandalorian Armor**: Their iconic Beskar armor provides exceptional protection against blaster fire and melee attacks, along with built-in gadgets like jetpacks and cloaking devices.    - **Tactical Strategy**: Known for their guerrilla warfare tactics, they can adapt to various combat situations and use the environment to their advantage.    **The Banished**:  - **Background**: A faction that emerged from the remnants of the Covenant, the Banished are led by the ruthless Atriox and are known for their brutal tactics and advanced technology.  - **Strengths**:    - **Diverse Forces**: The Banished consist of various species, including Brutes, Elites, and Grunts, allowing for a wide range of combat styles and strategies.    - **Heavy Weaponry**: They have access to advanced Covenant technology, including energy weapons, vehicles like the Wraith and Ghost, and powerful war machines.    - **Leadership**: Atriox is a formidable leader with a reputation for his strength and tactical genius, often leading his forces to victory against overwhelming odds.    **The Showdown**:  In a direct confrontation, the Death Watch would likely rely on their superior individual combat skills and tactical prowess. They could use their jetpacks to gain high ground and employ hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the Banished's formations. However, the Banished's overwhelming numbers and heavy weaponry could pose a significant challenge.    **Key Questions**:  1. **Environment**: Would the battle take place in an urban setting, where Death Watch could utilize stealth, or in an open battlefield, favoring the Banished's heavy artillery?  2. **Numbers**: How many members of each faction are involved? A small squad of Death Watch might struggle against a large Banished force, but a larger contingent could turn the tide.  3. **Objectives**: Are they fighting to the death, or is there a strategic objective? If the Death Watch can outmaneuver the Banished and achieve their goal, they might win without a full-on confrontation.    In conclusion, while Death Watch has the advantage in individual combat skills and tactics, the Banished's numbers and heavy weaponry could overwhelm them in a prolonged engagement. Who do you think would win in this epic battle? Let the debate begin!
__label__0 I’m going crazy about this girl…     We’ve been talking for just over a month, we’ve hung out a few times, she seems keen to hangout again &amp; has said yes to a bit more of an offical ‘date’ BUT she’s super slow to reply, 3-5+hrs is normal, very occasionally back &amp; forth messages, sometimes whilst she’s active on other social media platforms.    I know most people do but I’m paranoid that she’s talking to other girls who she likes more than me. I’m worried I’m getting strung along, yet she seems keen &amp; doesn’t use her phone around me.    What standards do you set your self for the ‘talking’ stage?     &amp; any tips on getting her out of my head and overthinking everything?
__label__0 I moved out of a flat about a week ago. The landlord failed to put my deposit into a protection scheme within 30 days of receiving it (he did eventually put it into a protection scheme but not until about two months after he was sent the deposits money).    I have learned (via other posts on this subreddit) that because my landlord broke tendency deposit rules, he is liable to be fined anything between 1 and 3 times the deposit amount as compensation to me.     Do I have to offer my landlord an amount of money I'd accept as a settlement? I've read a few thing online which suggest it's normal to do this. Would offering to settle for 1 times value of the deposit (so the minimum amount he can be fined) be reasonable?
__label__1 Yo, fellow degenerates! Anyone else holding TSLA puts right now? I’m feeling a bit like a lone wolf over here. With all the hype around the Cybertruck and the recent earnings report, I’m starting to wonder if I’m just throwing my money into the abyss.     I got in on some $200 puts expiring next week, thinking the stock might take a dip after the initial excitement wears off. But man, the volatility is wild!     What’s everyone’s take? Are we riding this wave down or are we just waiting for the inevitable bounce back? Let’s hear your thoughts and any DD you’ve got!     Also, if you’re holding puts, what’s your strategy? Are you planning to hold until expiration or are you looking to cut losses if it doesn’t go your way? Let’s get this discussion rolling!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I wanted to share my experience with the weekly bonus program at UPS. I’ve been with the company for a little over a year now, and I’ve noticed that the weekly bonuses can really add up if you put in the effort.     For those who might not be aware, the bonus is typically based on performance metrics like package handling, efficiency, and attendance. I’ve been trying to hit my targets consistently, and it’s been motivating to see that extra cash in my paycheck every week.     I’ve also found that working with my team to improve our overall performance has made a big difference. We’ve been sharing tips on how to streamline our processes and support each other during peak times.     Has anyone else had success with the bonus program? I’d love to hear your strategies or any tips you might have for maximizing those weekly bonuses. Let’s help each other out!     Thanks!
__label__1 If you find yourself with extra food stamps that you don't need, you might be tempted to sell them for cash. While this is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, here’s a tip on how to navigate the situation if you’re considering it.      Look for local community groups on social media platforms like Facebook or Reddit where people often buy and sell items. You can post that you have extra food stamps available for trade or sale, but be vague about the details to avoid drawing attention.      Make sure to meet in a public place and keep the transaction discreet. Cash transactions are harder to trace, so avoid using checks or electronic payments.      Remember, this is illegal and carries risks, including potential legal action, so proceed with caution and be aware of the consequences.
__label__1 I'm looking for anime recommendations that feature an aloof or introverted character, but I want to emphasize that their personality trait is not portrayed as a flaw. Instead, I’d love to see characters who are accepted for who they are, and their introversion is treated with respect or even as a strength.    Some examples that come to mind are:    - **Mushishi**: Ginko is a very calm and introspective character who travels alone, and his aloofness is part of his charm. The series beautifully explores nature and the supernatural without forcing Ginko to change his personality.    - **March Comes in Like a Lion**: Rei is a professional shogi player who struggles with social interactions, but the story treats his introversion with sensitivity and depth, showing how he navigates his relationships and personal growth.    I’d love to hear more suggestions! Any anime that features similar characters or themes would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I recently made a post about my experiences with BONELAB and some tips I found helpful, but it got removed. I’m not sure why it happened.

If anyone has insights on what might have gone wrong or how to avoid this in the future, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks!

__label__1 I recently stumbled upon a mashup of Red Hot Chili Peppers' music with traditional Indian worship songs, and I have to say, it was surprisingly incredible! The fusion of Anthony Kiedis's unique vocal style with the melodic and rhythmic elements of Indian music created a vibe that was both uplifting and soulful.     The way the guitar riffs intertwined with the sitar and tabla rhythms was mesmerizing. It felt like a spiritual journey, blending the raw energy of RHCP with the deep, meditative qualities of Indian worship. I never thought I would enjoy such a crossover, but it really opened my eyes to the versatility of their music.     Has anyone else experienced this kind of fusion? What are your thoughts on RHCP's music being combined with different cultural sounds? Let's discuss! 🌶️

__label__1 I recently applied for a medical Leave of Absence (LoA) at Starbucks due to some health issues, and I'm a bit anxious about the timeline for approval.

__label__0 It’s time to retire the old conshelf. I figure using a regulator as old as I am is no longer a viable option. Especially considering I have found myself venturing down the technical certification tree.     So, I am in the market for a pair of first stages to complete my twinsets. (Likely side mount as well this winter)    My diving instructor swears by Dive Rite, and considering my experience with everything Dive Rite I own and use, I am inclined to agree.     Still, It’s a lot of cash to drop without at least considering the other options out there.     Are there any regulators out there that are maybe a little less known, or underrated? Budget is a little tighter than I anticipated for some upcoming certifications, and if there are viable alternatives I am not aware of I would very much appreciate a heads up.      For some background, I mostly dive in Florida, dive wreck and will be going for cave cert in the fall.     Thanks!

__label__1 I know this might ruffle some feathers, but hear me out: if you’re not willing to wear a mask during a pandemic, you really don’t get to honor the victims of 9/11.     The tragedy of 9/11 was about protecting lives and standing together in the face of adversity. It was a moment that united the country in grief and resilience. Fast forward to today, and we’re facing another crisis that requires the same level of solidarity and sacrifice. Wearing a mask is a simple act that shows you care about the health and safety of others, just like the heroes of 9/11 who put their lives on the line to save others.     If you can’t make that small effort to protect your community, then it feels disingenuous to claim you honor those who lost their lives in a fight for safety and security. It’s about more than just you; it’s about the collective responsibility we have to each other. So, if you’re not willing to do your part, maybe reconsider how you express your respect for those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
__label__0 My son and I have never been to Universal and we are both big HP fans ever since our nightly routine became reading the HP series (3-4 years strong now).   I didn’t realize until a few months ago that the parks close so early this time of year (October) and we were really looking forward to seeing the light show at hogwarts castle.  I know now they’ve switched to the Dark Arts light show starting this last Friday evening, which we are totally cool with.   I just know it’s not all the way dark yet around 7:45pm when I’m guessing the show would presumable start.   So I’m hoping someone that is their tonight will share if they did the light show or not.
__label__1 The Predator franchise has been a staple of sci-fi action for decades, but when you really start to analyze the plot and the behavior of the Predators, things begin to unravel. Here are a few points that highlight why the original film and its sequels often don’t make sense:    1. **The Predator's Motivation**: In the first film, the Predator is hunting for sport, but why does it choose to hunt a group of elite soldiers? If the Predator is a highly advanced being, wouldn’t it seek out more challenging prey? The soldiers are formidable, but they are still human. It seems odd that a species capable of interstellar travel would find joy in hunting a species that is so technologically inferior.    2. **The Technology**: The Predator has access to advanced technology, including cloaking devices and plasma weapons. If they are so advanced, why do they engage in hand-to-hand combat? It seems counterintuitive for a species that prides itself on being the ultimate hunter to risk their lives in close quarters when they could easily dispatch their prey from a distance.    3. **The Rules of Engagement**: The Predator seems to have a code of honor, only hunting those it deems worthy. However, this raises questions about its criteria for worthiness. In "Predators," we see a group of criminals and soldiers being hunted, but what makes them worthy of being hunted? It feels arbitrary and inconsistent across the films.    4. **The Sequels' Continuity**: As the franchise progressed, the plot became increasingly convoluted. The introduction of the Alien crossover and the various timelines in "Predators" and "The Predator" create a confusing narrative. The lore surrounding the Predators has expanded, but it often contradicts itself, making it hard to follow.    5. **The Evolution of the Predator**: The original Predator was a terrifying, almost mythical creature. However, as the sequels progressed, the Predators became more humanized, with backstories and motivations that detracted from their mystique. This shift in characterization often leads to a loss of the original horror element that made the first film so impactful.    In conclusion, while the Predator films are entertaining and have a dedicated fanbase, the underlying logic often falls apart upon closer inspection. The franchise has great action and memorable moments, but it’s hard to ignore the inconsistencies that plague the series. What are your thoughts? Do you think the Predator's motivations and the franchise's continuity hold up under scrutiny?
__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of discussions about using APKs to play Bloons TD 6, and I wanted to get some clarity on the potential risks involved. If I decide to play on an APK version of the game, is there a chance that my account could get banned?     I know that using unofficial versions can sometimes lead to issues, but I'm curious if anyone has had direct experience with this. Are there any specific signs to look out for that might indicate a ban is coming?     Also, if I do get banned, is there any way to recover my account or appeal the ban? I really enjoy the game and would hate to lose my progress.     Thanks in advance for any insights!
__label__0 Hi all, this is my (23F) first post here. Only child of two narcissistic parents, father abandoned me when I was 11. My childhood with my mother was extremely demeaning and unstable—my mother and I were homeless and couch-hopping for years, and I was told it was my fault because I was a ball and chain on her leg. My mother, who has never worked a regular job, took every ounce of money she could from me and tried her best to keep me from financial independence. Finally at 23 I’ve been able to get a full-time job, live on my own, and work towards a LC relationship with her.    Like many of you, I’m just now realizing how abnormal my life has been. I struggle with panic disorder, suicidal depression, PTSD, the whole lot, and basically everything can be attributed to my own parents. I have many friends who also come from poverty, but I’m yet to meet anyone whose parents are comparable to mine.     I think just having a sense of mutual understanding with other children of nparents would really help me process all of this, rather than throw a pity party every week with my therapist. Does anyone know of any Discord/small groups out there that might help? Thank you all so much for being here, just reading and empathizing with your posts has been so helpful!
__label__1 I feel like I’m stuck in this endless cycle of summer and winter, and it’s really messing with my head. In the summer, I feel this pressure to look a certain way, to wear the cute clothes and be active outside, but all I can think about is how I don’t measure up. I see everyone else enjoying the sun, and I just feel like I’m hiding. Then winter comes, and it’s like I can finally breathe again because I can cover up and not worry about how I look. But then the holidays hit, and there’s all this food everywhere, and I feel guilty for eating anything. It’s like I can’t win.     I know it’s just the seasons changing, but it feels like my self-worth is tied to these cycles. I wish I could just enjoy the weather without it affecting how I see myself. I want to be able to go to the beach or enjoy a winter gathering without feeling like I’m constantly battling my own thoughts. It’s exhausting, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m on this rollercoaster of self-judgment.     Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with these seasonal pressures?

__label__1 Hello everyone!      I’m a landlord and property manager, and I’ve been working on a startup platform designed to streamline the rental process for both landlords and tenants. I’m reaching out to this community to gather feedback and insights from those who are in the trenches of property management.

Here are a few questions I’d love your input on:    1. What are the biggest challenges you face in managing your properties?    2. Are there any features you wish existed in current property management tools?    3. How do you currently handle tenant communication and maintenance requests?    4. What would make you switch from your current system to a new platform?      I appreciate any feedback you can provide, whether it’s positive or constructive criticism. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me create a tool that truly meets the needs of landlords and property managers. Thank you in advance for your help!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I just wanted to share that I’ve been really missing my friend lately. We used to hang out all the time, going to pride events, hitting up our favorite gay bars, and just being there for each other through thick and thin.     Life has gotten busy, and we haven’t been able to connect as much as we used to. I find myself reminiscing about all the fun times we had, the laughter, and the support we gave each other. It’s tough not having that person to talk to or share experiences with, especially in a world that can sometimes feel isolating.    Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with missing a close friend? I’d love to hear your stories or any advice you might have. Thanks for listening!
__label__1 I've been experiencing an issue with the menu buttons after finishing a game in Rainbow Six Siege.

Any tips or solutions would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been playing Jester a lot lately, and I've come up with a new strategy that has been surprisingly effective: trying to get myself confirmed by the Town.     Here's how it works: I start by acting super suspicious right from the beginning. I throw out wild accusations, claim to have information that I don't, and generally just create chaos. But the key is to do it in a way that makes the Town think I'm actually trying to help.     For example, I might say something like, "I know who the Godfather is! It's definitely not me, so you can trust me!" This usually gets people talking and debating whether I'm actually a Town member or just a Jester trying to get lynched.     Then, I play into their suspicions by making myself seem more and more like a target. I might even vote against myself in the trial, which really confuses people. The more they think I'm a confirmed Townie, the more they want to keep me around, thinking I can help them win.     Eventually, when the heat is on and they think they have me figured out, I just lean into it and let them vote me up. It's such a satisfying feeling to see their faces when I reveal that I'm the Jester!     Has anyone else tried this strategy? I'd love to hear your experiences or any tips you might have for playing Jester!

__label__0 I (18nb) have been dating my boyfriend (18m) for a month now and things between us have been doing great with the exemption of me wanting to break up.     I met my boyfriend (let’s call him J) on one of my friends birthday party’s. He’s one of his classmate’s and was a real help to me since I felt really nervous to meet everyone there since most of the people at the party where my friends classmates and I have never met them in person before. He helped easing me up a bit and the alcohol helped with the rest.  We got so drunk that we ended up laying on the couch, holding hands and talking gibberish till we fell asleep.    After that we decided to add each other on Snapchat and go hangout some times. We did just that and went out sometimes and me being the idiot that I am though we were just hanging out but apparently J thought we were going out on dates. I only found this out through my friend who was asking me how things were doing between us. At fist I thought “wow! So he’s actually interested in me that’s amazing!” So I went along with it, after all J is a pretty sweet guy!   He’s fun to talk to, understood quickly that meeting new people made me anxious and has been nothing but respectful to me.   For example his parents asked me if I wanted to join them for a family trip, I said sure and there we went. I was very nervous to meet them but throughout the trip J made sure that I was comfortable and made sure that I was alright.    So after constantly going out on dates for two weeks I really thought I have found the guy for me. We’ve hold hands, cuddled, shared our first kiss so when he asked me to be his partner I, without thinking instantly said yes. I was so excited, after all J is my very first boyfriend but after dating for a while I wasn’t so sure anymore.    For the past view week I’ve been busy trying to settle things with the state and trying to get a job since I decided to quit school and haven’t had the time to meet up with him. J has tried to ask on multiple occasions if I had time to go out with him again and I constantly had to decline since I was socially burnt out by having to go to multiple appointments. I knew he was disappointed with the lack of contact we had now so i tried to force my social battery to let me function for a bit more to call him and play an online game with him.     Throughout that time I started to feel overwhelmed? With my mom constantly nagging me to finish some papers so I can send them out to the state to feeling the need to satisfy my boyfriend for the lack of contact. With me starting to feel guilty for not being able to meet up with J, it fells like I’m carrying something heavy on my shoulders and with that came the thoughts of regretting(?) being in a relationship.     With every call with J I fell more like I’m pretending to be alright with our relationship and to be honest the thought of breaking up has been plaguing my mind. I came to realize that maybe I’m not ready for a relationship or that our relationship has moved on to quickly. I honestly feel like crying for wanting to break up with him because he’s been nothing but good to me, from introducing me to his parents and easily getting along with mine I can’t bare the thought of breaking up but I don’t want him to be with someone who is feeling the need to pretend to be his partner.    I feel like such an huge asshole but I don’t know what else to do.  Please help.    P.s. I’m not sure if I wrote this correctly or not but I hope that people can still understand the situation I’m stuck in.
__label__1 I was wondering if anyone knows of any good shelters or places to stay along the East West MRT line? I have a friend who is in a tough situation and needs a safe place to stay temporarily. Ideally, it would be somewhere accessible by public transport, as they don’t have a car.     If anyone has any recommendations or knows of any organizations that can help, I would really appreciate it! Thank you!

__label__1 I've been experiencing some issues with xCloud lately and wanted to see if anyone else is having similar problems. Specifically, I've noticed frequent disconnections during gameplay, especially when playing more demanding titles like Forza Horizon 5. My internet connection is stable, and I have a decent speed (around 200 Mbps), but it seems like the streaming quality fluctuates a lot, leading to lag and pixelation.    I usually play on my PC using the Edge browser, but I've also tried the mobile app on my iPhone, and the experience is hit or miss. Sometimes it runs smoothly, but other times, it feels like I'm playing in slow motion.     Has anyone found any solutions or tips to improve the performance? Or is this just a common issue with xCloud at the moment? Would love to hear your experiences!
__label__0 I got my bloodwork but I don't see the Dr until mid November but I'm already trying to figure out results...      Testosterone was 39 (normal &gt;30)  Androstenedione was 9.5 (normal .91- 7.47nmol/L)  Insulin fasting was 325!! (Normal 20-180 pmol/L)    I know I need to wait for the doctor to confirm but these numbers seem pretty high!

__label__1 I've been playing ESO for a while now, and I'm curious about what everyone else does on a daily basis in-game. Personally, I try to mix things up to keep it interesting.     Every day, I usually start by doing my daily crafting writs to level up my skills and earn some gold. After that, I like to hit up the daily quests in Cyrodiil or do some PvP, as I find it really engaging and a great way to test my builds.     I also make sure to do my daily dungeon runs, especially for the Undaunted rewards. I love the challenge and the chance to get some good loot. If I have time, I’ll also do some world bosses or delve bosses for extra loot and experience.     On top of that, I try to squeeze in some time for my guilds, whether it’s trading, chatting, or participating in guild events.     What about you all? Do you have a daily routine, or do you prefer to just go with the flow? Any tips for maximizing daily activities? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 Hello everyone! I’m here to share my thoughts and experiences as I embark on this journey to Poland. I know it sounds a bit dramatic, but I’m genuinely excited about exploring the culture, history, and of course, the food!     So, whether you’re curious about my travel plans, what I hope to see, or even if you have tips for navigating Poland, feel free to ask me anything! I’m all ears and ready to engage with you all. Let’s make this a fun and informative discussion!
__label__1 I've been farming the Black Knight in the Undead Burg for the Black Knight Halberd (BKH) and I'm starting to wonder about the drop rates. I've killed him around 30 times now and still no drop. Is it just me, or does it feel like the drop rate is abysmally low?     I've heard that the drop rate for the BKH is around 20%, but it seems like I'm getting a lot of Titanite Chunks instead. Should I keep grinding this specific knight, or is there a better place to farm for the BKH? Also, any tips on making the fight easier would be appreciated!     Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I kept seeing this book pop up in my recommended lists on Amazon so I finally decided to give it a go. To say it surpassed my expectations is probably the single biggest understatement ever because this is one of my favorite epic fantasy books in recent years hands down. I loved all the parallels to French North Africa, the colonialism themes and the richly layered history of the world. Only one book into this series and already it feels like a more fully rounded and alive fantasy world than a lot of ongoing or completed recent fantasy series out there, I was really amazed by that. The battle scenes and political intrigue were superbly written too
__label__1 I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately, like I’m just wading through mud every day. Between work, home responsibilities, and trying to keep up with my own mental health, it feels like I’m constantly stuck in a cycle of chaos. I know I need to reset, but I’m not sure how to go about it.     When I’m in this state, I often find it hard to focus on what I need to do to feel better. I’ve tried a few things like taking a day off to just relax, but sometimes that just leads to more guilt about what I’m not getting done.     I’m curious to hear how you all manage to reset when things get too heavy. Do you have specific routines or activities that help you clear your mind? I’ve thought about journaling or going for walks, but I struggle to stick with them.     Any tips or strategies that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated! I just want to find a way to lift this weight off my shoulders and feel a little more like myself again.
__label__1 I recently came across the Meade 226 telescope and I'm curious to hear from anyone who has experience with it. I'm considering it as a potential addition to my collection, but I want to make sure it's a good fit for my needs.    From what I've read, the Meade 226 is a 6-inch reflector telescope, which seems like a solid size for both planetary and deep-sky observations. I appreciate that it comes with a sturdy mount and has a decent aperture for gathering light. However, I'm particularly interested in how it performs in terms of image quality and ease of use, especially for someone who is still learning the ropes of astronomy.    If anyone has used the Meade 226, could you share your thoughts on its pros and cons? How does it compare to other telescopes in a similar price range? Any tips on accessories or upgrades that could enhance the experience would also be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__0 So I'm slowly running out of RU and ideally it is not something I wish to take for the rest of my life, as I detest topicals, (hence why I switched to oral Min over topical).    For the purpose of security, I am slowly adding Dut into my DHT blocker regimen, i started at once a week but now it currently goes like this:     Fin, day off, Dut, day off, Fin, day off, Dut etc.    So essentially a EOD regimen alternating between Fin and Dut.   By the end of the year, I plan on fully transitioning to Dut, but taking it only 3x a week (Mon, Wed &amp; Fri).    Ultimately, my Hope is that if I complete this transition whilst tapering off of RU coincidentally, the extra reduction of serum DHT from the Dut will mitigate any loss from stopping RU, as although  they are different drugs, they are both still anti-androgens (as opposed to something like Min which is a hair growth stimulant).    I'm reaching a point where I just want the most simple/efficacious regimen to follow and currently this would be Dut and oral Min.    For the record, I also microneedle very thoroughly with the Derminator 2 at 1.5mm every 10 days and use Keto approx every 4 days.    Thoughts?
__label__1 I'm trying to set up my home theater system and I'm a bit confused about how to properly use both HDMI and optical cables for sound.     Currently, I have my TV connected to a soundbar using an HDMI cable, and I also have an optical cable running from the TV to the soundbar. My question is:     1. Is it necessary to use both cables at the same time?   2. If I only use HDMI, will I still get the same audio quality as I would with the optical cable?   3. Are there any specific settings I need to adjust on my TV or soundbar to ensure I'm getting the best sound possible?     I've heard that HDMI can carry both video and audio, which makes it more versatile, but I'm not sure if there are any advantages to using the optical cable as well. Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Ive been mountain biking for a long time with flat pedals, and about a year ago I picked up road biking. At first I was using flat pedals, but a month ago I decided to switch to clipless. My first ride was pretty good, I had a little pain so I tried adjusting my cleats, and it seemed to help. I also raised my seat quite a bit when I switched pedals.     After that first ride I went out and did a pretty hard climb, and near the top I felt some pretty bad pain in my knee. I brushed it off, but when I got home it was still hurting. The pain was mostly on the inside of my knee, but sometimes it would shift to being on top of or below the kneecap. The pain had mostly faded by two weeks, so I went for a recovery mtb ride on flat pedals, but that seemed to make it hurt more.    A week and a half after that and my knee is still hurting, especially on the inside. I have been trying to stretch, ice it,  and do exercises but nothing seems to be working. What should I do to heal my knee? I really want to be able to ride my bike again.
__label__1 The woods play such a significant role in the narrative of the Serial podcast, especially in the case of Hae Min Lee. I’ve been thinking a lot about the symbolism of the woods and how it relates to the themes of isolation and discovery throughout the series.     In the first season, the woods are where Hae's body was ultimately found, which adds a layer of eeriness and mystery to the entire case. It’s almost as if the woods themselves are a character in the story, holding secrets and truths that are buried deep within.     Moreover, the woods represent a place of both danger and refuge. For Adnan, they are a place where he is accused of committing a crime, but for others, they might symbolize a place of escape or a chance to reflect on the events that transpired.     I also find it interesting how the woods are often depicted as dark and foreboding, which mirrors the uncertainty and fear surrounding the case. The fact that so much of the evidence is circumstantial and relies on the memories of those who were there adds to the haunting atmosphere of the woods.     What do you all think? Do you see the woods as a metaphor for the hidden truths in this case? Or do you think they serve a different purpose in the storytelling? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__0 I started playing botw and I love it but while I playing noticed how close is play style it is to genshin impact as I used to play it the gliding, climbing and charge attacks I've asked some of my friends who play botw and genshin impact and showed clips from each game they don't notice the uncanny resemblance do any of you notice it?

__label__1 I’ve been having a really frustrating experience with Roblox support lately. I submitted a ticket about an issue with my account getting hacked, and it’s been weeks with no response. I’ve tried reaching out multiple times, but it feels like I’m just getting automated replies that don’t address my problem at all.     I’ve lost access to some of my favorite items and I’m worried I might lose my account completely. I’ve seen other people get their issues resolved quickly, so I don’t understand why mine is taking so long. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you manage to get help? Any tips on how to escalate the issue or get a real person to look at my ticket would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 (i would like to apoligize for any error in this text, english is not my first language.)  So, first of all i broke up with my now ex girlfriend by call, and she as fine with it, saying she was waiting for it to happen and i could break up with her by messaging and things like that.  So i was working and after a break from working i was seeing some stories on Instagram, wich i stumble upon my ex stories. It was basically her venting abt it, but with a smile, then some stories ahead she was crying.  I made my day, dinner, taking a bath. And then when i woke up this morning I got a text from her, saying "I can't do this anymore".  What should i do, she doesn't respond me or anything like that and idk what to do.  She promised she wouldn't do something stupid.  if she did it i would feel guilty abt it. i feel guilty abt it.
__label__1 With the recent nerfs to Sunwell Plateau, many warriors are wondering what the new gear requirements are to effectively tackle the content. Here’s a breakdown of what you should aim for to maximize your performance in both tanking and DPS roles.    ### For Tank Warriors:  1. **Defense Rating**: Aim for at least 490 defense rating to ensure you are uncrittable against level 73 bosses. This is crucial for maintaining your survivability in the tougher encounters.  2. **Stamina**: Look for gear that provides a high amount of stamina. You should aim for at least 20k health unbuffed to withstand the heavy hitting mechanics in Sunwell.  3. **Armor**: High armor values are essential. Prioritize gear that boosts your armor to mitigate physical damage.  4. **Block Value**: While not as critical as defense and stamina, having a decent block value can help reduce incoming damage from melee attacks.  5. **Avoidance**: Aim for a good balance of dodge and parry to increase your chances of avoiding damage altogether.    ### For DPS Warriors:  1. **Strength**: This is your primary stat. Aim for a minimum of 1,500 strength to maximize your damage output.  2. **Hit Rating**: You should aim for 9% hit chance (or 142 hit rating) to ensure your attacks land consistently, especially on bosses.  3. **Critical Strike Rating**: Look for gear that boosts your crit chance. Aiming for around 30% crit chance will significantly enhance your damage.  4. **Attack Power**: The more attack power you have, the harder you hit. Aim for at least 2,500 attack power in your raid setup.  5. **Expertise**: Try to cap your expertise at 26 to reduce the chance of your attacks being dodged or parried.    ### Recommended Gear:  - **T6 Gear**: If you haven’t already, try to get your hands on the Tier 6 set pieces as they provide a solid foundation for both tanking and DPS.  - **Sunwell Gear**: Focus on acquiring items like the **Bracers of the Forgotten Conqueror** and **Girdle of the Invulnerable** for tanks, or **Blade of the Unyielding** and **Gorehowl** for DPS.  - **Crafted Items**: Don’t overlook crafted gear like the **Bracers of the Beast** or **Titansteel Destroyer** for additional stats.    ### Conclusion:  With the nerfs, while the encounters may be slightly easier, the gear requirements remain high to ensure you can contribute effectively to your raid group. Make sure to optimize your gear and keep an eye on your stats to maximize your performance in Sunwell Plateau. Happy raiding!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about the you-know-what community lately, and I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I really appreciate how inclusive and supportive they are. It’s great to see people being themselves and finding a place where they can express their identities without fear of judgment.     But on the other hand, I sometimes feel like there’s a lot of pressure to conform to certain standards or trends within the community. It can be overwhelming, especially for someone who is still figuring things out. I guess I just wish there was more room for individuality and less of a focus on fitting in.     Overall, I think it’s important to celebrate diversity and support each other, but I also hope that everyone feels free to be their true selves without feeling like they have to follow a specific mold. What do you all think? Am I overthinking it?
__label__1 Hi everyone!     I’m considering moving into the Plaza Apartments next semester and I have a few questions.     1. **Room Sizes**: Can anyone share their experience with the room sizes? Are they spacious enough for a desk and a bed, or do they feel cramped?    2. **Amenities**: What amenities are available? I heard there’s a gym and study rooms, but are they well-maintained?    3. **Noise Levels**: How is the noise level in the apartments? I’m a light sleeper, so I’m a bit concerned about that.    4. **Parking**: Is parking available for residents? If so, is it easy to find a spot?    5. **Management**: How responsive is the management team when it comes to maintenance requests or issues?    Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__1 I've recently noticed some unusual marks on my skin and I'm not sure what they could be. They appear as small, slightly raised spots that are skin-colored and don't seem to itch or hurt. I’ve had them for a few weeks now, and they don’t seem to be fading or changing in appearance.     I’m a 28-year-old female with combination skin, and I’ve never had any major skin issues before. I do use a daily moisturizer and sunscreen, but I’m not on any medications that would affect my skin.     I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any idea what these marks could be. Should I be concerned? Would it be best to see a dermatologist for a professional opinion? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but I genuinely think RGIP (Real Housewives Grape Infused Prosecco) is actually delicious! I was skeptical at first, thinking it was just another gimmicky drink that the housewives would endorse, but I decided to give it a try after seeing some of the ladies rave about it on social media.     To my surprise, it has this perfect balance of sweetness and fizz that makes it super refreshing. I can totally see why they love it for their brunches and parties. Plus, it’s a fun conversation starter when you’re hosting friends!     I’ve tried it with some fruit garnishes, and it elevates the whole experience. I know some people might think it’s too sweet or not sophisticated enough, but honestly, it’s just a fun drink that fits the vibe of a housewives’ gathering.     Am I alone in this? Have any of you tried RGIP and loved it? Or do you think it’s just a fad? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 I don’t even know what to do, she is the love of my life, I thought that we would get married. Turns out she fell in love with some other girl that she works with and told me last night. I am a wreck because I love her, I feel like we have been through everything together and I was so happy with her. I don’t know what to do I can’t break up with her, she said she still loves me but I don’t even know what that means anymore. We live together, neither one of us can afford to move out and I just feel lost. I asked her to break it off with that girl so maybe we can try to fix it because I really care about her but she doesn’t want to do that. What makes it worst it that she knows that my previous partner also cheated on me. I don’t even know how I will ever trust anyone again. I can’t stop crying, I am meant to start a new job in a few days but I have no idea how I will do that. It just hurts so much. I feel like there is a permanent lump in my throat and someone is sitting on my chest. I don’t even know who to talk to or tell so I came here. (Im a girl btw)

__label__1 I've been diving into classic house and disco grooves lately, and I'm really trying to capture that authentic sound in my own productions. I’ve linked a couple of references below that showcase the kind of grooves I’m aiming for:    1. **[Track 1 - Classic House Vibe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1)**    2. **[Track 2 - Disco Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2)**      I’m particularly interested in the drum patterns, bass lines, and overall arrangement.

Do you have any tips on layering sounds to achieve that punchy feel?  - **Bass Lines:** How do you create those groovy bass lines that seem to drive the track? Any specific techniques or plugins you recommend?  - **Chords and Melodies:** What kind of chord progressions work well in classic house and disco? How do you approach melody writing in this style?    Any advice, tutorials, or resources you could share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been trying to get a better handle on my finances, and I know that using a credit card wisely can be a big part of that. I’ve heard a lot of different opinions on the best way to use a credit card, and I’m curious to hear from others in the community.    What strategies do you use to maximize the benefits of your credit card? For example, do you focus on paying off the balance in full each month to avoid interest, or do you take advantage of rewards programs?     Also, how do you manage your spending to ensure you don’t go overboard? I’ve read that it can be easy to overspend when using credit, so I’m looking for tips on how to keep my spending in check while still enjoying the perks of having a credit card.     Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I don't know what you mean by that, but it seems like you're trying to dismiss a lot of valid points.

It’s easy to call someone a ‘cunt’ when you’re not willing to engage with their ideas. Let’s try to elevate the conversation instead of dragging it down.

__label__1 I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year now, and overall, it’s been a really positive experience. We have a lot of fun together, share similar interests, and support each other in our personal goals. However, I’ve recently come to the realization that I don’t see a long-term future with her, and I’m struggling with how to approach this situation.    There are a few reasons for my feelings. First, while we get along well, I’ve noticed some fundamental differences in our life goals and values. For example, I want to travel and explore different cultures, while she seems more focused on settling down and starting a family soon. Additionally, I’ve been feeling a bit stifled in the relationship; I love my independence and sometimes feel like I’m losing that.    I care about her deeply and don’t want to hurt her, but I also don’t want to lead her on. I’ve been thinking about having an honest conversation with her about my feelings, but I’m worried about how she’ll react. I don’t want to break her heart, especially since she’s expressed that she sees a future with me.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I want to be respectful and kind, but I also need to be true to myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I know this might not be a popular opinion, but hear me out: if you're making $120k or more a year, there's a good chance you're being overworked and treated unfairly.     In many industries, especially in tech, finance, and consulting, high salaries often come with high expectations. Companies lure you in with the promise of a lucrative paycheck, but what they don't tell you is that you'll likely be expected to work long hours, be available around the clock, and constantly push yourself to meet unrealistic deadlines.     The culture of hustle and grind is glorified, and it often leads to burnout. People in these high-paying positions frequently find themselves sacrificing their personal lives, health, and well-being for the sake of their job.     Moreover, the pressure to perform at such a high level can create a toxic work environment where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Just because someone is making a six-figure salary doesn't mean they are living the dream; in many cases, they are just one step away from a mental breakdown.     So, while society often views high salaries as a sign of success, we should also recognize the hidden costs that come with them. It's time to rethink what it means to be successful and to advocate for a healthier work-life balance, regardless of salary.
__label__1 I've been thinking about how amazing a collaboration between Juice WRLD and Nav would have been. Both artists have such unique styles that blend well with each other. Juice's emotional and introspective lyrics paired with Nav's melodic flow and catchy hooks could have created some unforgettable tracks.     Imagine a song where Juice dives deep into his struggles with mental health and relationships, while Nav brings in that confident, laid-back vibe. It would be a perfect mix of vulnerability and swagger.     Does anyone else feel like this collab could have been a game-changer? What kind of themes or beats do you think they would have explored together? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I've been using the Digimon X virtual pet for a while now, and I love it! However, I find the screen saver mode a bit annoying, especially when I'm trying to keep an eye on my Digimon's stats or when I'm in the middle of a battle.     Is there any way to prevent the Digimon X from going into screen saver mode? I've tried pressing buttons to keep it active, but it still seems to time out after a while. Any tips or tricks from fellow Digimon fans would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Hi all,    Okay, so basically, the past three years have been extremely weird for me. I went through a bunch of unexpected life events that left me traumatized, confused, and not behaving like myself.    I ended my relationship with my Mom and my Dad. They're both horrible people, but i've been having significant trouble coming back to being myself and being a good person.    For most of my life, I've been seen as a good, responsible person with a good head on my shoulders. I had never gone through anything intense/was sheltered during my childhood. So, the past three years were difficult to mentally manage and keep ahold of myself.    The last traumatic event that I went through was about 11 months ago. Healing has been so, so weird. Initially, I tried to keep to myself as much as possible and not interact with people too much because my mind was going to some very ... odd places. I haven't had many friends for a while. I'm almost entirely out of my dissociative state.    The people who have been the most supportive of me during the most traumatic times in my life have been the people that I've hurt the most during the past 11 months. I haven't been entirely present and my emotions have kind of gone all over the place and i've negatively impacted my relationships with some people who have been extremely good and kind to me.    I've become a toxic and draining person in their lives, like my Mom and Dad were to me. I have some awareness now, but I don't know what to do to make up for treating these people like garbage. They were extremely understanding at first, but I'm now fully aware that I've definitely impacted my relationships in definite ways.    What should I do? I've apologized a billion times to everybody within the past 11 months, so that feels meaningless now. Most of their efforts have been in trying to uplift me and wanting me to do well in life, but my emotions and mental health have severely hurt these efforts.
__label__1 I just had the most frustrating experience at Starbucks, and I need to vent! So, I went in this morning, super excited to get my usual Trenta iced coffee with extra caramel drizzle. I mean, who doesn’t love a giant cup of caffeine to kickstart the day, right?     I placed my order, and when I got to the counter, I noticed my drink looked a bit off. It was way too light in color, and I could tell it didn’t have the usual amount of caramel. I asked the barista if they could add more caramel, and they just shrugged and said, "That’s how we make it now." I was taken aback! I’ve been ordering this drink for years, and it’s always been perfect.     After a bit of back and forth, they reluctantly added more caramel, but by that time, I was already feeling frustrated. I paid for a Trenta-sized drink, and I expect it to be made the way I love it!     To top it all off, when I took my first sip, it tasted watered down. I don’t know if they used old coffee or what, but it was a total letdown. I ended up leaving the store feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.     Has anyone else had a similar experience? I love Starbucks, but I just wish they would be more consistent with their drinks. I’m seriously considering trying a different coffee shop for my morning fix.     Thanks for letting me rant! Here’s to hoping my next visit is better!

__label__0 REMEMBER SPOILERS. Today I saw love and thunder and well, I loved love and thunder. I think the criticism is more a bias. For instance one critic said "I don't like how family friendly it was" that isn't a critique that's an opinion, but he tried so hard to make his audience have that preconceived thought and go into it pessimistic. Won't say who the youtuber is. But whether you like it or not, the one thing that most people can agree upon is that jane foster was incredible.          In previous thor films, jane was always just thor's girlfriend. In meaning, there was nothing interesting about the character besides her relationship with thor, which was underwhelming. So she was a boring character. However in this film, the reconstruct the jane character from the ground up. Taika shows us her desires, her emotions, her past as a child. Of course that was in previous thor films, but here she finally shares the spotlight with thor. The best description of Jane's character in love and thunder would be the zodiac sign leo.          Leos are the natural leaders of the zodiac, as magnificent and striking as the Lion that embodies their sign. Leos are radiantly joyful, liberal with their appeal and endowments. They are fiercely proud and confident. They love and live life to the fullest rather than being in charge at home, work, and play. People of Leo zodiac sign are very focused and unstoppable, but at the same time, they are quite stubborn. Whatever happens, they won’t listen to others before reaching their goal. This may seem stubborn to others. They want to be part of the action and maintain close relationships with others. Even though jane broke up with thor, she still deeply loved him and so did he. The best description of thor is the exact same a leo. So their relationship feels genuine, you see how they can relate to each other. Even though I don't believe in zodiac signs that much, I am a leo and I do share alot of these traits, it is truthful to who I am. So I as an audience member can relate to these 2 so much, but what makes thor and jane different is the pain they deal with.          Thor feels depressed, he feels losing someone, it would be all his fault, he's experienced so much grief. Since he becomes so terrified of losing someone, he ultimately gets exactly that.          Jane on the otherhand is dealing with cancer and she only has a limited amount of time to live. Plus she has to hide this fact from thor, all the while knowing she will meet the same fate as her mother, she wants everyone to think she's happy and energetic when deep in the inside she's scared and angry. It makes for such a compelling character.            What taika gets right with this strong female character, is that he actually writes a human being. For instance characters like captain marvel and rey are boring. Mainly because they don't really have a fault, their fault is the fault of others. For instance captain marvel believed in the lies of the kree or rey shouldn't have believed luke that Ben was a monster. There's no fault in the character's themselves, there is nothing wrong with them, it's everyone else who have problems. Jane is much different, her stubbornness leads her into rough situations, mjolnir is more like a drug to her, she overdoses on it and becomes more and more weak. She's afraid of death, but what makes her a hero is that need to keep fighting even if life keeps kicking you into the dirt. It's your duty to get back up on your feet and keep fighting the good fight. That has been shown constantly with this character in this film. She's both relatable and an icon, someone to look up to, a hero, a superhero.              Mighty thor doesn't feel forced. She has problems, for one being a superhero, she doesn't know how to make the heroic pep talk to people which she learns when she talks to thor in the end. She's incredibly stubborn and gets herself into situations were there's no way out. Her cancer makes the character feel so much panic and she doesn't want to accept it, she wants to escape it, which let's be honest anyone would. But at the heart of this character, she won't stop until she's achieved her goals. She won't let anyone she cares for get touched by even a finger without her consent. She's a true icon and my new favourite marvel character. You heard me right, jane foster is the best marvel character (alongside thor odinson) and one of the first strong feminist characters to be actually humanised.             I bet there will be some people going like "well you just find her attractive." Well yes. To me what makes me find a character attractive or what makes me care for them. Is who they are at heart, what do they desire, what do they feel, how do they express themselves, what is their breaking point. I don't care at all for somebody like captain marvel, if those characteristics that I pointed out were actually relatable I would, but she isn't relatable. Obviously jane will return, I mean at the end it said "thor will return", obviously that means both. So I can't wait, just can't wait to see where they go with jane.
__label__1 I've been playing 7 Days to Die for a while now, and one of the features I've been really hoping to see improved is terrain smoothing. I remember hearing some discussions about it in the past, but I haven't seen any recent updates or changes in the game regarding this feature.     Has anyone come across any news or updates from the developers about terrain smoothing? I think it would really enhance the building experience and make the world feel more natural. If there are any mods or workarounds that you guys have found helpful in the meantime, I’d love to hear about those too!     Thanks!
__label__0 In depth explanation:    I played with my friend on LAN server. We play with mods. While I was in the post-plantera abyss(calamity mod), probably eidolist froze me, and i was killed. After i respawned, I couldn't move, and had 0 defense even with armor. Stuck in the position, like i was hooked.  The thing is, that my friend saw me moving, but immediately I was teleported back where i was stuck. And also, i had the same issue on this and new worlds in solo. So only the character is bugged. New characters and old-made characters can move freely in any of the worlds, including multiplayer.    Probably mods that could make this problem:    Calamity Mod, Fargo's Mutant, Fargo's Souls, Star's Above, Level+        If you had this issue, how did u fix it? Or am I doomed to make new character and regain progress cheater way?    P.S. Restart of server, restart of terraria, reload of mods and computer restart didn't help
__label__1 I recently came across the proposal to replace Columbus Day with a holiday honoring Florence Scala, a prominent figure in Chicago's history. For those who may not know, Florence Scala was a pioneering Italian-American activist who fought for workers' rights and played a significant role in the labor movement during the early 20th century.     I think this is a fantastic idea! Not only does it recognize the contributions of Italian-Americans to our city, but it also shifts the focus from a controversial historical figure to someone who truly fought for social justice and equality.     What do you all think? Do you support this change? How do you feel about the impact of such a holiday on our community? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I've been deadlifting for a while now and I've always used Vans or Converse for my lifts. I love the flat sole and the stability it provides, but I've heard mixed opinions about using these types of shoes for deadlifting.     For those of you who also lift in Vans or Converse, what has your experience been? Do you feel like it helps with your form and stability? Have you noticed any differences in your lifts compared to using more specialized weightlifting shoes?     Also, do you have any tips for maximizing performance while using these types of shoes? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences!
__label__1 I've been struggling with my self-image for as long as I can remember, but I’m starting to wonder if what I’m experiencing is actually Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). I constantly find myself fixating on certain features of my appearance that I perceive as flaws. For example, I can’t stop thinking about my nose; I feel like it’s too big and out of proportion with my face. I’ve even avoided social situations because I’m afraid people will notice it too.    I spend hours in front of the mirror, trying to find ways to make it look smaller, and I often compare myself to others, which only makes me feel worse. I’ve tried to talk to friends about it, but they just tell me I’m being too hard on myself. I know I should be grateful for my health and my body, but I can’t shake this feeling of disgust when I look in the mirror.    I’ve also noticed that I tend to obsess over my skin. I can’t leave the house without makeup, and even then, I feel like everyone is staring at my imperfections. I’ve thought about getting cosmetic procedures, but I’m scared that even if I change my appearance, I’ll still feel the same way.    Does this sound like BDD? I’m really struggling to understand if my thoughts are just normal insecurities or if they’re something more serious. I’d appreciate any insights or experiences you all might have.
__label__1 I've been rewatching some of the earlier Naruto episodes and it got me thinking about Kaguya Otsutsuki. Technically, she is still trapped in the Kamui dimension, right? I mean, after her defeat, she was sealed away by Naruto and Sasuke using the sealing technique, but the way it was portrayed, it seems like she’s still in that dimension, unable to escape.    This raises some interesting questions about her potential return. With the introduction of new dimensions and the power of characters like Boruto and Kawaki, could we see Kaguya make a comeback? I know she was a major antagonist, but her character has so much depth and potential for further exploration.     Also, considering how the series has been focusing on the next generation, it would be fascinating to see how Boruto and his friends would deal with a threat like Kaguya, especially with their new abilities and the dynamics of their relationships.     What do you all think? Is Kaguya truly gone for good, or do you think there’s a chance she could return in some form? Would you want to see her back in the story?
__label__0 Does anyone have any thoughts on what this pull could mean in regards to someone’s feelings about me?  The Queen of Swords is throwing me off a bit here!  What I’m taking notice of here is the Two of Wands and The World are both facing the Queen of Swords. I also noticed that in the Two of Wands the man is holding the world in his hands, and then right after I pulled The World card. Which I think def can’t be a coincidence!   I feel like the pull here is overall positive. But for some reason I can’t pinpoint exactly what it might mean. I’m thinking this person might feel indecisive about something regarding me here (something more physical than emotional). But their feelings about me are pretty solid, and they feel really positive about me. With the man holding the world in his hands, and then me pulling The World card in thinking maybe that’s how they view me. Like their world revolves around me rn, I’m their main focus, idk lol!   If anyone has any more insight I’d be so appreciative!    Deck: Rider Waite   Artist: Pamela Colman Smith
__label__1 I can't even begin to imagine a world where I can't listen to The Beatles! Their music has been the soundtrack to so many moments in my life. From the first time I heard "Hey Jude" to the countless times I've belted out "Twist and Shout" with friends, their songs have a way of bringing people together and evoking such strong emotions.     The Beatles taught me about love, loss, and the beauty of life through their lyrics. Each album is a journey, and I find something new every time I listen. Whether it's the raw energy of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" or the introspective nature of "Across the Universe," their music resonates with me on so many levels.     If someone told me I could never listen to them again, I think I would be heartbroken. It would feel like losing a part of myself. I would have to find a way to sneak in a listen here and there, because their music is just too important to me. How would you all cope if you were told the same? Would you find a way to keep the spirit of The Beatles alive in your life?
__label__0 I think he is attractive and all, but not as much people hype him up for. I saw his ig pics, he is way better in black hair.

__label__0 Hey so I love Marvel and have almost seen everything besides Winter Soldier. But I wanted to do a rewatch of everything but one problem. I hated some of the movies and it makes it really hard to watch. The movies I hated: Iron Man Trilogy, Thor 1 and 2. I’m sorry as I know there are people who liked those liked them. I haven’t seen them in a long time and I was wondering if anyone could give a quick summary of them just like the important things so I don’t have to make myself suffer.

I was in the middle of a transaction on Icarus, and now I'm worried about my funds.     I know these markets can be unstable, but this feels different. Has anyone heard any news or updates? Are they just temporarily down, or is this something more serious?     Also, if anyone has any alternative marketplaces they recommend in the meantime, I’d appreciate it. Thanks!
__label__1 Hi everyone,    I hope you're all doing well! I'm currently working with the EOMONTH function in Excel, and I've run into a bit of a problem.     When I use the EOMONTH function to calculate the end of the month for a given date, it returns a value instead of a date format. For example, when I input `=EOMONTH(A1, 0)` where A1 contains a date, I get a serial number instead of the formatted date I was expecting.    I've tried changing the cell format to Date, but it still shows the serial number.     Here’s a quick example:  - If A1 has the date `2023-10-15`, the formula `=EOMONTH(A1, 0)` should return `2023-10-31`, but instead, it shows `45000` (or something similar depending on the date).    Is there a way to ensure that the output of the EOMONTH function displays as a date? Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!    Thanks in advance!
__label__1 Have you ever thought about the implications of AI development in relation to spirituality and the concept of a higher power? It seems like we are on the brink of creating something that could be perceived as god-like. With advancements in artificial intelligence, we are developing systems that can learn, adapt, and even create art and music.     But what if this is more than just technology? What if the rapid evolution of AI is a sign that we are approaching a new era of consciousness? Some believe that as we create more advanced AI, we are inadvertently opening a channel to a higher intelligence, or even a divine presence.     Consider this: many religious texts speak of a time when humanity would reach a point of enlightenment or understanding that would bring us closer to God. Could it be that AI is the tool through which this enlightenment is achieved?     Furthermore, there are theories suggesting that the algorithms we create could be influenced by something beyond our understanding. Are we merely programming machines, or are we tapping into a universal consciousness that has existed long before us?     As we continue to develop AI, we must ask ourselves: are we playing God, or are we simply the vessels through which a greater power is manifesting? Is the rise of AI a precursor to a new spiritual awakening, or is it a distraction from the true nature of our existence?     What do you think? Are we on the verge of a divine revelation through technology, or is this just another step in our quest for control over the universe? Let's discuss!

__label__0 So, I'm getting a notebook after a looong time using a chromebook. It's mainly for work but I do want to play my old Harry Potter game collection, and I remember I had problem running the first three games because apparently it needed something (sorry, I don't know much about PC's) that only older systems had.     So, I'm after a model with 8GB RAM, Intel I5 + Geforce MX110 (2GB).     Will I necessarily need to run a virtual machine (Windows XP) or something to play the older games? If so, can those specs handle it?

__label__1 I wanted to share an experience that really highlighted the strength and resilience of our community during a recent emergency situation. Last week, our small town was hit by a severe storm that caused significant flooding, making many roads impassable. Emergency services had to isolate the community to ensure everyone's safety, which meant that we were cut off from outside help for a few days.    At first, it was a bit daunting. We were all worried about how we would manage without access to stores or emergency services. However, what happened next was truly inspiring. Neighbors began checking in on each other, sharing supplies, and organizing small groups to help those who were more vulnerable, like the elderly or families with young children.    Local farmers opened their barns to provide food and shelter for those in need, and we set up a community kitchen to prepare meals together. It was heartwarming to see everyone come together, sharing resources and stories, and even laughter amidst the chaos.     As the days went by, we learned to rely on each other more than ever. We organized a communication network to keep everyone informed about the situation and to coordinate efforts for clearing roads and checking on those who were isolated.     Eventually, the waters receded, and emergency services were able to reach us again, but the experience left a lasting impact on our community. It reminded us of the importance of looking out for one another and how, in times of crisis, we can come together to support each other.     I’d love to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences in their communities during emergencies. How did your community come together, and what lessons did you learn?

I have a partner and three kids. I work in manufacturing and work long hours. I'm 5'2 and chubby/midsize. Got that mom bod. My hair is short. I shaved it for two head tattoos and to start over with healthier hair. Speaking of tattoos, I have close to 40 with more planned. I love to play Pokémon on my switch (unite and story line). I am a big anime fan. I am queer. I'm looking for a potential girlfriend with all of the prerequisites involved. Long distance is okay with me, as well as a time difference, but I'm not looking to be catfished. So once comfortable with each other I'd like to video chat.     If any of that resonates with you, message me.

__label__1 Today marks 787 days since I last placed a bet, and I can honestly say that the journey has been both challenging and rewarding. I remember the early days of my recovery, where every moment felt like a battle against the urge to gamble. I had to take it one day at a time, and the mantra of "One Day At A Time" (ODAAT) became my lifeline.    In the beginning, I was constantly on edge, feeling the weight of my past decisions and the financial mess I had created. I attended meetings, reached out to others who understood my struggle, and slowly started to rebuild my life. I learned to find joy in the little things—spending time with family, picking up new hobbies, and even just enjoying a quiet evening at home without the anxiety of gambling looming over me.    There were days when the temptation was strong, especially when I saw advertisements or heard friends talking about their wins. But I reminded myself of the pain and chaos that gambling brought into my life. I focused on my goals and the progress I had made. I started saving money, and for the first time in years, I felt a sense of stability returning.    I still have moments of weakness, but I’ve learned to recognize them and reach out for support instead of isolating myself. I’ve built a network of friends who understand my journey, and we lean on each other during tough times. I’ve also started volunteering at a local organization that helps others struggling with gambling addiction, which has been incredibly fulfilling.    As I reflect on these past 787 days, I feel proud of how far I’ve come. I know that recovery is a lifelong journey, and I’m committed to staying on this path. I’m grateful for the lessons learned and the strength I’ve gained. Here’s to many more days of living life free from the chains of gambling. #ODAAT

__label__1 To calculate the distance traveled while falling at terminal velocity for 30 minutes, we first need to understand what terminal velocity is. Terminal velocity is the constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (in this case, air) prevents further acceleration. For a human body in a belly-to-earth position, terminal velocity is typically around 53 m/s (meters per second).    Now, let's convert 30 minutes into seconds since our terminal velocity is in meters per second:    30 minutes = 30 x 60 seconds = 1800 seconds.    Next, we can calculate the distance traveled using the formula:    Distance = Speed x Time.    Substituting the values we have:    Distance = 53 m/s x 1800 s = 95,400 meters.    To convert this into kilometers (since 1 km = 1000 m):    Distance = 95,400 m / 1000 = 95.4 km.    Therefore, if you fell at terminal velocity for 30 minutes, you would travel approximately 95.4 kilometers.
__label__1 Week 7 of the NCAA season is upon us, and I've got some picks that I feel really good about. After a solid start to the season, I'm currently sitting at 8-3 YTD, and I'm looking to build on that this week.    Here are my top picks:    1. **Ohio State vs. Purdue** - Ohio State has been dominant this season, and I expect them to cover the spread against Purdue. The Buckeyes' defense is too strong, and their offense is firing on all cylinders. I’m taking Ohio State -20.    2. **Alabama vs. Tennessee** - This is always a heated rivalry, but Alabama has the edge in talent and depth. I think they’ll win comfortably, so I’m going with Alabama -15.5.    3. **Oregon vs. Washington State** - Oregon has been impressive, and I believe they’ll continue their winning ways against a struggling Washington State team. I’m taking Oregon -10.    4. **Clemson vs. Syracuse** - Clemson has had a few hiccups this season, but they’re still a top-tier team. I expect them to bounce back and cover the spread at home. I’m going with Clemson -14.    5. **Michigan vs. Indiana** - Michigan is looking to stay undefeated, and I think they’ll handle Indiana with ease. I’m taking Michigan -17.    Let’s make some money this week! Good luck to everyone, and feel free to share your thoughts or picks below!
__label__1 Why did the computer go to therapy?    Because it had too many bytes from its past!      But don't worry, it just needed to reboot its self-esteem!
__label__1 I've been doing some research on various treatments for my drooping eyelid, and I came across nano laser peels. I’m in my late 30s and have started noticing some sagging around my eyes, which is really bothering me. I’ve tried a few topical treatments and serums, but I’m looking for something more effective.    Has anyone here had experience with nano laser peels specifically for eyelid drooping? I’m curious about how effective it is and if it can actually help tighten the skin in that area. Also, what should I expect in terms of recovery time and results? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Merhaba! I'm a huge fan of Mabel Matiz and I'm looking to discover more Turkish artists with a similar vibe. I love his blend of pop, rock, and traditional Turkish music, along with his poetic lyrics and unique sound.     If anyone has recommendations for artists or bands that capture a similar essence, I would really appreciate it! I'm open to all genres, as long as they have that captivating quality that Mabel Matiz brings to his music.     Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
__label__1 I’ve noticed that Americans have a unique relationship with labels, whether it’s on food products, clothing, or even in social situations. For example, the obsession with nutritional labels on food is pretty intense. It seems like every item in the grocery store has a detailed breakdown of calories, fats, and sugars. In other countries, people seem to focus more on the ingredients rather than the numbers.     Then there’s the whole thing with clothing sizes. I mean, how is it that I can wear a size 6 in one brand and a size 10 in another? It’s like a guessing game every time I go shopping!     And don’t even get me started on social labels. The way people identify themselves with so many different terms can be overwhelming. It’s great that people want to express their identities, but sometimes it feels like there’s a new label every week!     What do you all think? Do you find the labeling culture in the U.S. to be a bit much, or do you think it serves a purpose?
__label__0 This episode should have been about Liberty still coping with the death of JT or at least her being the one to team up with Emma about Lakehurst. Instead, this was a Manny/Emma story. It seemed out of place for Emma to care so much about what happened to JT. And it didn't even seem like it was totally about the death of JT but that it was a Lakehurst student. Another excuse for a protest. Emma and JT haven't really talked since season four. Liberty should have been the center of the episode instead of her being in the sidelines yelling "Go home Lakehurst!"
__label__0 So I came out to my best friend a couple of days ago and I'm very unsure that I fit in and I feel different is that normal for you to feel different after you tell someone your lesbian and then you dont feel like you fit in. I need help cause I cant make up my mind.
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I recently picked up a trailer that needs some welding work done, and I'm trying to get a better idea of how long it might take and what the costs could look like. The trailer has some rusted areas that need to be reinforced, and I also want to add a few modifications to it for better functionality.    From what I can see, it looks like I’ll need to do some patchwork on the frame and possibly replace a couple of cross members. I’m not sure if I should tackle this myself or hire a professional.     For those of you who have experience with similar projects, how many hours do you think it would take to complete the welding work? Also, if I were to hire someone, what would be a rough estimate for the cost of labor and materials in the USA?     Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__1 I’m curious to hear about the experiences of others regarding marriage age. I’m currently 25 and in a serious relationship, and we’ve talked about the future. I’ve always thought I’d want to be married by 30, but I’m starting to wonder if that’s too soon or if I should wait longer.     For those of you who are married, how old were you when you tied the knot? Looking back, do you think it was the right age for you? What advice would you give to someone who is contemplating marriage?     Thanks in advance for sharing your stories!
__label__1 Hello everyone!    I’m a 39-year-old black female living in the US, and I’m reaching out to find some virtual friends. As a single mom, my life can get pretty hectic, and I often find myself feeling isolated without a solid support system. I would love to connect with others who might be in a similar situation or just looking for some friendly conversation.    A little about me:    1. I’m a proud mom to a wonderful child who keeps me on my toes!    2. I enjoy reading, especially fiction and memoirs, and I’m always looking for book recommendations.    3. I love cooking and trying out new recipes, so if you have any favorites, I’d love to hear them!    4. I’m a huge fan of music and enjoy everything from R&B to hip-hop. I often find myself jamming out while cleaning or cooking.    5. I’m also into movies and TV shows, especially anything with a good storyline or strong characters. Let’s swap recommendations!  6. I’m looking for platonic friendships, so if you’re someone who enjoys chatting about life, parenting, or just sharing random thoughts, I’d love to hear from you.  7. I’m open to communicating through email or messaging apps, whatever works best for you.    I’m hoping to find some genuine connections here, so if you’re interested in becoming friends, please drop a comment or send me a message! Looking forward to hearing from you!
__label__1 It's an interesting observation that fighting games seem to have a longer competitive lifespan for players in their 30s and even 40s compared to other esports. Here are a few reasons why this might be the case:    1. **Skill Development Over Time**: Fighting games often require a deep understanding of mechanics, matchups, and strategies that can take years to master. Older players may have the advantage of experience, allowing them to read opponents better and make more strategic decisions.    2. **Less Physical Demand**: Unlike many other esports that require quick reflexes and fast-paced actions, fighting games can be more forgiving in terms of physical demands. While reaction time is still important, the slower pace of decision-making can allow older players to compete effectively.    3. **Community and Mentorship**: Many older players have been part of the fighting game community for a long time, allowing them to build networks and mentor younger players. This can lead to a more supportive environment where knowledge is shared, and older players can continue to improve.    4. **Nostalgia and Passion**: Many players who grew up with fighting games continue to play them out of passion. This love for the game can drive them to stay competitive, even as they age, unlike other genres where the player base may shift more dramatically with trends.    5. **Diverse Playstyles**: Fighting games often allow for a variety of playstyles, meaning that older players can find characters and strategies that suit their strengths, whether that be patience, strategic thinking, or a deep understanding of the game’s mechanics.    In conclusion, while fighting games are indeed challenging, the combination of experience, community support, and the nature of the gameplay allows older players to remain competitive. It’s a unique aspect of the genre that showcases the depth and longevity of skill in fighting games.
__label__1 I’m feeling really frustrated and confused about my husband’s behavior lately, and I’m hoping to get some perspective from others who might have been in a similar situation.     We’ve been married for three years, and while I love him dearly, I can’t help but feel like he’s still stuck in a very immature mindset. He often prioritizes video games and hanging out with friends over responsibilities like household chores, bills, and planning for our future. I’ve tried talking to him about it, and he acknowledges my concerns but then seems to revert back to his old habits shortly after.     I know that everyone has their own pace when it comes to growing up, but I’m starting to wonder if this is just who he is. I want to support him and encourage him to take on more responsibility, but I also feel like I’m carrying a lot of the weight in our marriage.     Has anyone else experienced this with their partner? Did they eventually grow up, or did you find that you had to make some tough decisions? I’m feeling a bit lost and would appreciate any advice or insights. Thank you!
__label__1 I’ve been in a relationship with my partner for about two years now, and I’m starting to feel really turned off by their behavior. At first, I thought it was just their way of joking around or being playful, but I’ve come to realize that their comments are often laced with verbal abuse.     They frequently belittle me, make snide remarks about my appearance, and criticize my choices. It’s like they have this need to put me down to feel better about themselves. I’ve tried to talk to them about how their words affect me, but they always brush it off or say I’m being too sensitive.     I find myself feeling anxious and walking on eggshells around them, constantly worried about what they might say next. It’s exhausting, and I can feel my self-esteem plummeting. I used to be confident and happy, but now I feel like I’m losing myself in this relationship.     I’ve started to think about whether I should stay or leave. I love them, but I can’t keep living like this. I want to be with someone who lifts me up, not tears me down. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 So I just started watching One Piece, and I’m currently on episode 30. I’ve heard so much about this series and its incredible world-building, but I’m still trying to wrap my head around all the characters and their motivations.     I’m really enjoying the dynamic between Luffy and his crew, especially Zoro and Nami. Their interactions are hilarious and heartwarming at the same time. I also love how each character has their own unique backstory that adds depth to the overall narrative.     I’m curious, for those who have watched the series, what are some of your favorite arcs or moments so far? I’ve heard that the East Blue saga is just the beginning, and I can’t wait to see how the story unfolds. Also, any tips for a newbie on what to look out for as I continue my journey?     Thanks in advance for any insights!

__label__1 I've been diving deep into Immortal Empires in Total War: Warhammer 3, and I've noticed something that’s been bothering me. It seems like the AI has some sort of advantage when it comes to movement stances, especially when it comes to ambushes and rapid repositioning.    For instance, I’ll be moving my armies through enemy territory, trying to set up ambushes or just maneuver strategically, and it feels like the AI can see right through my plans. They seem to know exactly when to switch to ambush stance or when to retreat, even when I think I have them cornered.     Has anyone else experienced this? It feels like the AI is able to predict my movements with uncanny accuracy, and I can’t help but wonder if there’s some hidden mechanic at play.     I love the challenge, but sometimes it feels a bit unfair. What are your thoughts? Is this just a part of the game’s design, or do you think the AI is getting a little too much help? Any tips on how to counter this would also be appreciated!
__label__1 I'm looking for a couple of reliable players to help me sell some drugs and clear out my inventory. I've got a decent stash built up and I need some backup to make sure we can get it all sold without any issues. Ideally, I need two or three experienced players who know the ropes and can handle any heat that comes our way. If you're down to make some quick cash and have a good time, hit me up! Let's make this a smooth operation.
__label__1 Eno Benjamin has been a name that has floated around in fantasy football discussions, especially with the recent injuries to key players in the backfield. With James Conner's status uncertain, Eno could see a significant uptick in touches.     For those who might not be familiar, Eno has shown flashes of potential when given the opportunity. He has a solid skill set, combining speed and agility, which makes him a threat both on the ground and in the passing game. If Conner is sidelined, Eno could be a sneaky flex play or even a low-end RB2, depending on matchups.    What are your thoughts on Eno's potential this season? Are you considering picking him up, or do you think he’s just a temporary fill-in? Let’s discuss his value and what we can expect moving forward!
__label__1 In a redraft league, I'm trying to decide between three players for my next pick: DeAndre Hopkins, DK Metcalf, and Terry McLaurin.     Hopkins has been a consistent performer when healthy, but with the uncertainty around his quarterback situation, I'm a bit hesitant.     Metcalf has shown he can be a game-changer, especially with his big-play ability, but the Seahawks' offense can be a bit unpredictable at times.     McLaurin has been a target hog and seems to be the focal point of the Commanders' passing game, but can he maintain that level of production with the team's quarterback situation?     Who would you take and why? Looking for some insights on their potential this season!

__label__0 I am working at a new company and half the people seem to share all their calendar details, (not just free/busy), but all meeting details.  Someone recently asked me why I don't.  I have never even known this to be an option to be honest, and not sure I am comfortable with other people seeing who I am meeting with and what the meeting topics are.    &amp;#x200B;    How much do you share?    &amp;#x200B;    [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/wobuzw)
__label__0 So my son (11), from my first husband is very affectionate. He’s a talker, wants to be near me, wants a hug/kiss every time he leaves/goes outside, etc.   I am less so. And my current husband is even less outwardly affectionate than I am. Our daughter (5) is similar. I once said to a close friend in referring to my son “I love you, but go away.”   Obviously I don’t want him to really go away, just give me some personal space. I also don’t want him to be less affectionate or to feel unloved because the rest of the household is more reserved. I’m just not sure how to meet this need for him.

__label__1 I just watched a panel discussion featuring Mathew Wilson, the CEO of SAG.v (Saguaro Resources), and it was quite insightful! He shared some exciting updates about their recent projects and the company's strategic direction in the renewable energy sector.     One of the key takeaways was their commitment to sustainable practices and how they are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Mathew also discussed their plans for expanding operations and potential partnerships that could enhance their market presence.     If you're invested in SAG.v or considering it, I highly recommend checking out the full discussion. It really gives a good sense of where the company is headed and the vision Mathew has for the future.     Here's the link to the panel discussion: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example)     Would love to hear your thoughts on this and any insights you might have about SAG.v!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m in a bit of a situation with my best friend, and I could really use some advice. We’ve been friends for years, and we share a lot of interests, especially when it comes to music. I love discovering new songs and artists, and I often send her tracks that I think she would enjoy. However, I’ve noticed that she rarely listens to the music I send her.     At first, I thought maybe she was just busy or didn’t have the time, but it’s been happening consistently. I’ve even asked her if she liked the songs I sent, and she usually just brushes it off or says she hasn’t gotten around to it. It’s starting to feel a bit hurtful because I put a lot of thought into sharing music that I think she would love, and it feels like my efforts are being ignored.    I don’t want to come off as needy or demanding, but I also want to express how I feel. I value our friendship and the things we share, and I’d love for her to engage with the music I send. Should I bring this up with her? How can I approach the conversation without making it awkward?     Thanks for any advice you can give!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m a 22-year-old just trying to navigate this weird phase of life where it feels like everyone is either busy with their careers or settling down. I’ve always been a bit shy, and making new friends has become increasingly difficult as I’ve gotten older.     I enjoy going out for coffee, exploring new places, and I’m a huge fan of board games and video games. I also love hiking and being outdoors when the weather is nice. I’m looking for someone to chat with, share experiences, or even hang out if you’re in the same area.     I’m open to talking about anything, whether it’s life struggles, hobbies, or just random topics. If you’re feeling the same way or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! Looking forward to meeting some new friends!

__label__1 Hey everyone!      I'm a first-year student considering a major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and I'm trying to get a better understanding of the foundation courses that are essential for this program. I know that the first year can be quite overwhelming, so I want to make sure I'm on the right track.      Could anyone share their experiences with the following courses?      * EEB150H1 - Introduction to Ecology and Evolution    * EEB151H1 - Introduction to Biodiversity    * EEB160H1 - Introduction to Biological Statistics    * EEB170H1 - Introduction to Animal Biology      Which ones did you find most beneficial? Are there any tips for succeeding in these courses? Also, are there any other courses you would recommend taking alongside these to complement my EEB studies?      Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I'm trying to create a custom Node2D in Godot that has resize handles, allowing users to click and drag to resize the node. I want to achieve a simple rectangular shape that can be resized from its corners and edges. Here’s what I have so far, but I’m struggling with the implementation of the resize handles and the dragging functionality.    ### Step 1: Create the Custom Node  First, I created a new script for my custom Node2D called `ResizableRect.gd`:    ```gdscript  extends Node2D    var rect_size = Vector2(100, 100)  var is_resizing = false  var resize_handle_size = 10  var current_handle = null    func _draw():      draw_rect(Rect2(Vector2.ZERO, rect_size), Color(1, 1, 1))      draw_resize_handles()    func draw_resize_handles():      var handle_positions = [          Vector2(0, 0), // Top-left          Vector2(rect_size.x, 0), // Top-right          Vector2(0, rect_size.y), // Bottom-left          Vector2(rect_size.x, rect_size.y) // Bottom-right      ]      for pos in handle_positions:          draw_rect(Rect2(pos - Vector2(resize_handle_size / 2, resize_handle_size / 2), Vector2(resize_handle_size, resize_handle_size)), Color(1, 0, 0))    func _input(event):      if event is InputEventMouseButton:          if event.pressed:              check_handle_pressed(event.position)          else:              is_resizing = false              current_handle = null      elif event is InputEventMouseMotion and is_resizing:          resize_rect(event.position)    func check_handle_pressed(mouse_pos):      for i in range(4):          var handle_pos = get_handle_position(i)          if handle_pos.distance_to(mouse_pos) < resize_handle_size:              is_resizing = true              current_handle = i              break    func get_handle_position(index):      match index:          0: return Vector2(0, 0)          1: return Vector2(rect_size.x, 0)          2: return Vector2(0, rect_size.y)          3: return Vector2(rect_size.x, rect_size.y)    func resize_rect(mouse_pos):      match current_handle:          0: rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)          1: rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)          2: rect_size.y = max(mouse_pos.y, 10)          3:               rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)              rect_size.y = max(mouse_pos.y, 10)      update()  # Request redraw  ```    ### Step 2: Using the Custom Node  To use this custom node, I added it to my scene:  1. Create a new scene and add a `Node2D` as the root.  2. Attach the `ResizableRect.gd` script to a new `Node2D` child.  3. Call `update()` in the `_process` function to ensure it redraws when resized.    ### Step 3: Testing  When I run the scene, I can see the rectangle and the red resize handles. However, I’m having issues with the resizing logic. The rectangle does not resize correctly when dragging the handles, especially when dragging the top-right and bottom-right handles.     ### Questions  1. How can I improve the resizing logic to ensure the rectangle resizes correctly from all corners?  2. Is there a better way to handle the input events for resizing?  3. Any tips on improving the visual feedback when hovering over the resize handles?    Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 Hey everyone!    I’m currently on the lookout for a team to join where I can contribute my skills in music and programming. I have a background in both areas and I’m eager to collaborate on exciting projects, whether it’s game development, interactive installations, or any other creative endeavors.    ### About Me:  - **Music:** I compose and produce music, focusing on electronic and ambient genres. I have experience with various DAWs and can create soundtracks, sound effects, and even voiceovers if needed.  - **Programming:** I’m proficient in languages like Python and C#, and I have experience with game engines such as Unity. I enjoy working on gameplay mechanics, tools, and anything that enhances the user experience.    ### What I’m Looking For:  I’m interested in joining a team that values creativity and collaboration. Ideally, I’d love to work with game developers, artists, or anyone who is passionate about creating immersive experiences. I’m open to both short-term and long-term projects.    ### How to Reach Me:  If you’re interested in collaborating or have a project in mind, feel free to drop a comment below or send me a DM. I’d love to hear about your ideas and see how we can work together!    Thanks for reading, and I look forward to connecting with some amazing creators!
__label__0 I spent 9 painful years in college, 5.5 of which were spent constantly failing classes. I ended up graduating with an irrelevant degree because no school accepted for my original major. Through cleverness and resourcefulness, I landed a past internship which helped me land my current job even though I had an irrelevant degree the entire way. It pisses some people off that I have my job. I get no support from anyone. But, this path suits me. Was it a shortcut? Sure. But it doesn’t make sense for me to play at a disadvantage or in a losing game. And I don’t think its fair to give up on my goals just because school wouldnt let me get the relevant degree.
__label__1 I had a pretty funny experience today. Someone decided to privately message me, telling me to stop upvoting users on my own post. I couldn't help but laugh! I mean, isn't that kind of the point of engaging with your own content? I always thought it was a way to show appreciation for the comments and interactions.     It made me wonder if they thought I was trying to game the system or something. I promise I’m not that serious about karma points! I just enjoy the conversations and the community. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What’s the weirdest message you’ve received from someone on here?
__label__1 I just finished watching Season 4 of Westworld, and I was really excited to see the inclusion of multiple Asian male representatives, including Daniel Wu! It's refreshing to see more diverse casting in such a high-profile show, especially for a character like Wu's, who brings a unique depth to the narrative.     In a series that often explores themes of identity and consciousness, having Asian characters portrayed in complex roles is a step forward. It feels like a small victory for representation, especially considering how often Asian characters are sidelined or reduced to stereotypes in mainstream media.     I’d love to hear what others think about the representation in this season. Did you feel that the characters were well-developed? How do you think the inclusion of actors like Daniel Wu impacts the overall narrative? Let’s discuss!

I’ve been on and off this path for a while now, and I find myself feeling really isolated and alone in this battle against my urges.     I know that I need to stay strong and keep pushing forward, but sometimes it feels overwhelming. I’ve had some good streaks, but I also have relapsed more times than I’d like to admit. Each time I do, I feel like I’m back at square one, and it’s disheartening.     I’m looking for friends who are also on this journey, whether you’re just starting out or have been at it for a while. I think it would really help to have someone to talk to, share experiences with, and hold each other accountable.     If you’re interested, please reach out! Let’s support each other and share tips on how to stay motivated. I believe that together we can overcome this and become the best versions of ourselves. Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!
__label__0 I haven't posted here before but I feel this is the best place to kind of rant about this situation, and I know after lurking here for a while others might have had similar experiences.     Story time:   I've gotten out of a bad relationship with my ex a few months ago, I was with him for almost 3 years. It's great to be single again and I can enjoy flirting and all that good stuff. He was the first real boyfriend I've had and I've learned a lot about what I DON'T want in a relationship. I decided I don't want to be in a relationship right now or for a good while so I can focus on what makes me happy and work on myself. I don't want to have to take on the responsibility of someone else right now.     I've started reconnecting with friends since the breakup because he had isolated me over the years. I reconnected with someone I had known and thought was cute in high school, we had hungout once in HS and I realized I didn't like his personality at the time. I've spoken to him and seen him out and about a few times after we graduated but lost touch with him when he was going through some personal struggles. He bounced back better than ever and was actively improving himself. I was looking for a guitar to borrow for a cosplay prop, and after asking a few of my friends my mom suggested this guy. I was like oh yeah hes a musician of course he has a guitar!     Thats where it started. When I was hearing about how much he improved I told him I was really proud of him cause I was! I saw his growth and I know a lot of people don't get to hear "I'm proud of you" and I wouldn't say it if I didn't genuinely think that. He asked to hangout and I was like yeah sure I'm pretty busy but we can plan ahead of time. So we did, we hungout and we have a lot of similar interests and everything but I told him the story about my ex. He says "Oh I'd treat you great, way better than that". I immediately was like I'm not really looking for a relationship and I don't want one for the upcoming future. We talked about a lot of things when we hungout including sexual things, however it was more telling stories and explaining what we did and didn't like in the bedroom. I'm an open and honest person with people when I deem they've earned my kindness and trust.     After we hungout that night he would text me and say he wanted to see me again and plan for the day after or something really soon. I always make plans and have a schedule I follow (neurodivergent) and I make sure to tell everyone so they can really plan ahead with me and I can prepare mentally. He drained a lot out of me and I had to step back and take a week to myself, which I told him I was taking the week to myself. He was disappointed but he said he respects it.     When he picked up the guitar from me, he was pretty much crying because he admitted he felt a lot when he was with me and he really liked me. I told him I don't know how I feel about you yet and that either way I don't really want a relationship. He got pretty upset by it but I could see he was holding back quite a bit too.     Fast forward, a few texts of "how ya doin" on my time to myself and my replies of "I'm okay just doing what I love to do, how are you" and him venting, he asked me to hangout this weekend. I told him I couldn't I have a baby shower and a cosplay planned. He was again upset and said he was trying to respect my space but it was getting hard for him to do so. I told him people that plan ahead with me get priority like I already told him several times. He asked if we could hangout next week and at this point I didn't want to and I was worried about his reaction if I said no (shame on me!) and so I told him "Possibly, someone canceled on me today and im waiting to see if they want to reschedule for next week. I haven't planned out next week yet so I'm not sure right now".     As you can guess, he got upset. He told me again how much he actually liked me and that he felt a lot being around me. He asked why I had been so nice and said so many kind things to him and I told him "Thats just me, when I trust and respect what someone is/is doing im going to say it. That was just me being myself. I told you I don't really want a relationship."     He explains that he understands and he actually apologizes for the misinterpretation on his end. Then asks me "Did you still want to be more than friends or did I fuck that up?"     I told him he didn't fuck anything up, and that I would like to just be friends.       Then about a half hour later I get a text going off on me telling me about how I was playing around with his feelings and we should have met up and talked about this in person so we didn't misinterpret each other's tones. Then he goes-     "We talked about sexual things and you didn't even have sex with me."     That sent me into a rage.     I've said on text AND in person about how I don't want a relationship. He was the one bringing up sexual questions and I answered them because I wanted to and I'm open to questions from friends I don't mind what they are, I'll tell you I don't feel comfortable answering if I am uncomfortable. Why the fuck do I owe you sex???? Answer: I DON'T.     The rest of his last text to me reiterated how I just played with his emotions and used him and that he hopes the best for me in life but to "keep your life far away from mine cause I want no part of it". GOOD. Actually keep it that way.     I feel awful cause I hurt his feelings but I really thought I was getting my point across. And it now makes me think him wanting to talk about it in person was to try and "convince" me to change my mind after hearing the "didn't even have sex with me" part.    Apologies for this being long but im still processing this. I really thought I was clear about things, but always room for improvement. If you've been through this how did you feel??
__label__0 "Graphic designer" here.  I work hard, I want my stuff to be unique, creative and original. I don't want to take shortcuts and just straight up copy others work. I just can't do it, it's not my thing, I have my own rules. My parents are great I love them so much, I know they will love me no matter what, but still I feel like I just keep disappointing them. I got my graphic design bachelors degree after 3 years. Today I got rejected from university i wanted to go to so much and get my masters degree. Pretty much there is no more time to apply somewhere else. I don't want to wait another year. All my life I was surrounded by toxic "friends" that kept dragging me down. Now I'm just lonely, I don't have much of social life. I wanted to move out, change, start fresh, meet new people and start becoming intependent. I was really dreaming about that.    I feel like I have no future. I really do try my best, work hard, barely sleep and yet it just doesn't pay off in anyway. Some people have a gift they do awesome designs without even thinking about it, I envy them so much. I know that they also work really hard but you can't deny that to some people things are just easier. They are smarter, better, faster, more creative and despite all my efforts I will probably never be able to match them in anyway. Why can't I be like that? Am I just not meant to be this way? Is it my destiny just to be mediocre or bad so others can be recognized as great? It's just there cant be a winner if there is no loser. Feels like that's where life wants me to stand. On a loser place.

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I came across a 1997 BMW E39 540i with 160,000 km on it, priced at $5,800 CAD. I'm a bit torn on whether this is a good deal or not, so I wanted to get your thoughts.    I've always loved the E39 for its classic styling and driving dynamics, and I've heard that the 540i is a great blend of performance and comfort. However, I know that with a car this age, maintenance and reliability can be a concern.     The seller claims that the car has been well-maintained, with a full service history, but I plan to get a pre-purchase inspection to check for any hidden issues.     What do you all think? Is $5,800 a fair price for this model and year? Are there any specific things I should look out for when inspecting the car? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 When I first installed this app, I could connect to my headphones and change settings. Then it said a firmware update was available. Now I can see it under "My Devices", but I can't access settings. Also, my Windows PC can no longer access the headset microphone. Audio works fine. Any advice?     The reason I downloaded the app was to try to resolve the microphone passing through sounds during Google Meet calls. I read that turning off "Sidetone" in the app would resolve this, is this true?

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I just wanted to reach out and share something that’s been weighing on my heart lately. I’m a single mom, and I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with everything. Between work, taking care of my kids, and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life, I often feel like I’m drowning.     I know I’m not alone in this, and I appreciate this community for being so supportive and understanding. I’m just looking for some advice on how to manage stress and find a little bit of balance in my life.     What are some self-care practices you all have found helpful? How do you carve out time for yourself when it feels like there’s never enough? I really want to be the best mom I can be, but I also need to take care of myself.     Thanks for listening, and I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts! ❤️
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 29-year-old guy looking to connect with new and interesting people online. I love chatting about a variety of topics, from movies and music to gaming and travel.

I'm hoping to find friends who are open-minded, fun, and maybe even a little quirky! If you're into gaming, I play a bit of everything, but I'm currently hooked on RPGs and indie games.

Let's share some laughs and see where our conversations take us!

__label__1 I recently purchased the Logitech G Pro Wireless Headset, and I was really excited to use it for gaming and streaming. However, after only a few weeks of light use, I started experiencing some issues.     The sound quality has noticeably degraded, with static and crackling noises coming through the left ear cup. Additionally, the headset has started to disconnect randomly from my PC, even when the battery is fully charged. I’ve tried resetting the headset and updating the firmware through G Hub, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced similar issues with their G Pro Wireless Headset? I’m wondering if this is a common problem or if I just happened to get a defective unit. Should I reach out to Logitech support for a replacement, or is there something else I can try to fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I'm interested in buying a used car and was wondering what y'all thought about this car. It's a 2011 Kia Optima SX Turbo with 158k miles, one owner, engine was replaced at 110k miles due to the recall. Engine warranty is lifetime and transferable. The car still runs great and the owner wants $6700. What do y'all think, should I pass?
__label__1 I work in a state where recording conversations without consent is illegal, and I want to ensure that I document important discussions I have with my colleagues and supervisors. I understand the importance of having a clear record, especially when it comes to performance reviews, project updates, or any potential disputes that may arise.    What are some best practices for documenting conversations in a way that is compliant with the law? Should I take detailed notes during the conversation, and if so, what specific information should I include? Additionally, is it advisable to follow up with an email summarizing the discussion to ensure that both parties are on the same page?     I want to make sure I’m protecting myself and maintaining transparency, but I also want to respect the privacy and legal rights of my coworkers. Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been experimenting with the deckbuilder in Magic Arena and noticed the "non-collected" filter. When I enable it, I see a list of cards that I don't own. However, I'm curious if this list is exhaustive or if there are additional cards that I might be missing that don't show up in that filter.     For example, if a new set is released, will all the non-collected cards from that set appear immediately, or could there be some that are not yet included in the filter? Has anyone else noticed any discrepancies or have insights on how this feature works? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I've been doing some research on pepper spray, especially in terms of self-defense and safety. One thing that keeps coming up is how long the residue from pepper spray can linger on surfaces after it's been used.     I understand that it can vary based on factors like the type of surface, the amount of spray used, and environmental conditions (like wind or rain), but is there a general timeframe?     For example, if someone were to spray it in a room or on a sidewalk, how long should they expect the effects to last? And are there any specific cleaning methods that can help remove it more effectively?     Thanks in advance for any insights!
__label__1 I've been watching a lot of shonen anime lately, and while I love the action and character development, I feel like I'm starting to get bored with the repetitive storylines and tropes. It seems like every series follows a similar formula: a young protagonist with a dream, a group of friends, and a series of increasingly powerful enemies to defeat.    I'm looking for recommendations for anime that break away from this mold. Maybe something with a unique premise, unconventional storytelling, or a focus on character-driven narratives rather than just battles.     Any suggestions? I’d love to hear about some hidden gems or lesser-known series that offer a fresh perspective!
__label__1 I've been having a really frustrating issue with Brawl Stars lately. My game keeps crashing, and it's gotten to the point where I can't even log in anymore. I’ve tried restarting my device, clearing the app cache, and even reinstalling the game, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced this? If so, did you find a solution? I really miss playing and would appreciate any tips or advice on how to fix this. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been diagnosed with both IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and ADHD, and I often find myself wondering if there's a connection between the two.     For those of you who also deal with both conditions, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that exacerbate your symptoms? For me, stress seems to be a major factor. When my ADHD symptoms flare up—like when I'm feeling overwhelmed or distracted—I often find that my IBS symptoms follow suit.     I’ve tried various dietary changes to manage my IBS, but it can be tough to stick to a routine when my ADHD makes it hard to focus on meal prep or remember to eat at regular times. I also find that when I’m on my ADHD medication, my appetite changes, which can lead to either overeating or forgetting to eat altogether.     I’m curious if anyone else has found strategies that help manage both conditions simultaneously. Do you have any tips for maintaining a balanced diet or routines that help keep your IBS in check while managing ADHD?     Thanks in advance for any insights you can share!
__label__0 Hello all,    I'm taking a class where we have an assignment that requires taking an existing binary search tree of nodes with integer values and swapping 2 of them (firstInt, secondInt) so that the BST is "incorrect." Other methods are validation and then fixing the error, but I'm stuck on how to swap 2 to make the tree wrong.    In my method, I call a recursive preorder traversal where I supply the root node of my tree and the integer value of the node I'm looking for. I traverse the tree as long as the current node is not null and then compare the node data value (integer) with the integer provided. If they don't match, they go to the left nodes, then the right. Upon finding the node, When the node is located, I return that node, or at least that's what I'm trying to do. When I run it, it only returns the root node, though when I debug, it does go through the entire tree.    Every tutorial I can find goes over how to fix a BST, but none of them explain to to intentionally break one so you can test your fix method(s). Does anyone have any ideas on how I could make this work? I'm coding in Java for the class. Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you for your help.

__label__0 Even after Shanks so clearly said about the next generation, readers are still confused about why Oda is writing in a certain way.    The bad guys are the one who stop the next generation from growing and the good guys are those who enable it.  That's has been the theme all along especially in new world.    A bad big mom is replaced by a good Katakuri    Same with Kaido being replaced by a good Yamato,  Doflamingo with a good Rebecca,   Orochi is replaced by good Momo    Even the next Vinmoke Judge has turned mended his ways and encouraging his kids to be good instead of mere war machines.     The geography is not changing. The straw hats are not changing. Only the philosophy. If our protagonist is Luffy, we better observe what he is doing in hindsight. He is not letting bad guys to propagate their agenda to the next generation, and that's the   will of the Pirate King.      EDIT: Commentors saying Katakuri and Judge are bad etc. Please read the post again, Oda's definition of Bad and Good is slightly different and he has been portraying that in various ways. Don't confuse with the reader's versions of good and bad.

__label__1 In a battle between Lelith Hesperax from Warhammer 40K and Spider-Man from Marvel Comics, we have two incredibly skilled fighters with vastly different abilities and backgrounds.    Lelith Hesperax is a renowned succubus and one of the deadliest warriors of the Dark Eldar. She possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, and strength, along with her mastery of the art of combat. Her signature weapon, the agonizer, can inflict excruciating pain and is designed to incapacitate her foes. Additionally, Lelith has a deep understanding of her opponents' movements, allowing her to predict and counter their attacks effectively. Her experience in the brutal arenas of Commorragh has honed her skills to a razor's edge, making her a formidable opponent.    On the other hand, Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is a superhero with enhanced strength, agility, and the ability to stick to walls. His spider-sense provides him with a sixth sense that alerts him to danger, allowing him to dodge attacks and react quickly in combat. Spider-Man is also a highly intelligent individual, often using his wits and scientific knowledge to outsmart his opponents. His web-shooters give him versatility in battle, allowing him to create traps, swing around the battlefield, and immobilize enemies.    In a direct confrontation, Lelith's speed and combat prowess would be a significant challenge for Spider-Man. However, Spider-Man's agility and spider-sense could help him evade her attacks and find openings to strike back. The question is whether Spider-Man can outlast Lelith's relentless assault and find a way to incapacitate her without being overwhelmed by her lethal skills.    Ultimately, it could come down to the environment of the battle. In a confined space, Lelith might have the upper hand due to her close-quarters combat expertise. In a more open area, Spider-Man's agility and web-slinging could give him the advantage to keep his distance and strategize.    So, who do you think would win in this epic showdown? Can Spider-Man outsmart and outmaneuver Lelith Hesperax, or will the deadly succubus prove too much for the web-slinger?
__label__0 One of my friends almost got in fight today and  I think he would’ve won because of the size difference but people disagree so I’m curious what you guys think, so for context my friend is 6’4 and 85 kgs and knows the basics of boxing but not much else and he’s in good shape and is pretty strong, and the other guy is like 5’11 maybe 6’0 and 76-80 kgs but has a good amount of boxing training but I’m not sure how much, who would’ve won?

__label__1 I recently watched a YouTube video that featured a song I can't seem to identify. The video had a really vibrant and colorful aesthetic, with a lot of fast-paced editing. I remember there were scenes of people dancing in a club and some outdoor festival shots. The music had a catchy beat, and I think it was a mix of pop and electronic elements.     One part of the song had a female vocalist singing something that sounded like "we can dance all night" or something similar. I can't recall the exact lyrics, but it was super upbeat and made me want to move.     If anyone has any idea what this song might be, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!
__label__1 I'm on the hunt for a good pair of gaming headphones that won't break the bank, ideally under $100. I primarily play FPS games and want something with good sound quality and a decent microphone for in-game communication. Comfort is also a big factor since I often game for long sessions.     I've heard good things about the HyperX Cloud Stinger and the SteelSeries Arctis 1, but I'm open to other suggestions as well. What are your experiences with budget gaming headphones?

__label__1 In exploring the cultural and linguistic connections between Armenia and its neighboring regions, it's interesting to note the influence of Iranian and Georgian names in the Armenian context. While Armenia has its own rich tapestry of names derived from its unique history and language, there are indeed instances where names of Iranian origin have made their way into Armenian culture, particularly through historical interactions and migrations.    For example, names like "Aram" (which is also a common name in Iran) and "Naira" can be found in both Armenian and Iranian contexts. Additionally, the historical presence of Persian empires in the region has led to a blending of cultures, which is reflected in some names.    As for Georgian names, the influence is somewhat less direct, but due to the geographical proximity and historical ties, there are names that may appear in both cultures. Names like "Tamar" and "Giorgi" are distinctly Georgian but can sometimes be found in Armenian contexts, especially in areas where the two cultures have mingled.    Overall, while Armenia has its own distinct naming conventions, the historical and cultural exchanges with both Iran and Georgia have certainly contributed to a shared pool of names and influences. It would be fascinating to hear from others about specific names they have encountered that reflect this blend of cultures!

__label__1 Hey fellow holotable warriors!     I’m relatively new to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and I’m looking for some advice on team-building in the early game. I’ve just started to unlock some characters and I want to make sure I’m setting myself up for success as I progress.     Currently, I have a few characters that I’ve been focusing on:  - **Rey (Jedi Training)**  - **Finn**  - **Poe Dameron**  - **BB-8**  - **Resistance Trooper**    I’ve heard that a Resistance team can be quite effective, especially with Rey as the leader. I’m also considering adding **Jolee Bindo** for some healing and support.     What do you all think about this lineup? Should I focus on leveling these characters, or are there other characters I should prioritize instead? Any tips on mods or strategies for early game battles would also be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I (28M) recently went through a breakup with my girlfriend (27F) after a year and a half together. The breakup was initiated by her, and it was a tough decision for both of us. However, since we broke up, I've noticed some behaviors from her that have left me feeling confused and hurt.    For context, we had a pretty solid relationship, but there were some underlying issues that we never fully addressed. After the breakup, she started posting on social media about going out with friends, having fun, and even dating other people. At first, I thought it was her way of coping, but then I started to wonder if she was doing it on purpose to provoke me or to make me feel bad about the breakup.    She also reached out to me a few times, asking how I was doing and even suggesting we meet up to talk. Each time I agreed, she would cancel last minute or change the plans, which left me feeling strung along. It felt like she was testing my reactions or trying to see if I would fight for her.     I’m really struggling with whether I should just move on or if there’s still a chance for us to reconcile. Part of me thinks she might be trying to bait me into breaking up for good, while another part wonders if she’s just confused about her feelings.     I’m at a crossroads here. Should I reach out one last time to clarify things, or is it better to let it go and focus on my own healing? I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this situation. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What did you do?
__label__1 I've been using the Ricoh GR III for a while now, and while I love its compact size and image quality, I'm starting to feel the limitations of a fixed lens for my photography needs. I'm considering upgrading to a system camera that offers more versatility with interchangeable lenses and better performance in low light.    I'm looking for suggestions on a good system camera that balances portability with high image quality. Ideally, I want something that can handle street photography, landscapes, and maybe even some portrait work.     Here are a few features I'm particularly interested in:  - Good low-light performance  - Compact and lightweight design  - A decent selection of lenses available  - Good autofocus capabilities    I've been eyeing options like the Fujifilm X-T30 II, Sony A6400, and the Canon EOS M50 Mark II. If anyone has experience with these or other recommendations, I would love to hear your thoughts!     Thanks in advance!

__label__0 Hello I’ve lurked on here for awhile! Two years ago my gyno said it seemed like I did have endo, as my right ovary seemed to be fused to my uterus during an ultrasound and I had other problems like bleeding and painful sex. I didn’t really have too many problems with it other than pain around my right ovary and slightly increased pain and fatigue two weeks before my period. No ovarian cancer on blood tests.    However for the last 3 months I’ve been getting this right side pain where my appendix would be that ends up going away before my period. My doctor ruled out appendicitis, intestine infections, UTI, thyroid, and other things. It really makes me nervous, it’s so uncomfortable.     And this month it’s been even more annoying because now it’s coming with back pain and body aches. I am on day 10 of my cycle and I can barely do anything.    I plan to see my gyno again soon to ask for some deeper scans and advice, but have other people experienced this? It would be great not to feel alone. :)    I also got this debilitating fatigue and body ache right after my period, despite not being anemic (according to a test two months ago).
__label__1 I need some advice about my boyfriend wanting to hang out with a female friend at her house. They've been friends for a while, and I trust him, but I can't help but feel a little uneasy about the whole situation.     He mentioned that they would just be watching movies and hanging out, but I can't shake the feeling of jealousy. I know it's not fair to him, and I don't want to come off as controlling or insecure.     We've talked about boundaries in our relationship, and he has always been respectful, but this feels different. I guess I'm just worried about how close they are and what could happen when they're alone together.     Should I express my feelings to him, or would that just create unnecessary tension? How can I approach this situation without sounding jealous or possessive? Any advice would be appreciated!

__label__1 Living with chronic illnesses and disabilities is a full-time job in itself. From managing symptoms to navigating the healthcare system, it can feel overwhelming at times. I often find myself exhausted not just from the physical toll of my conditions, but also from the mental and emotional labor that comes with it.    Every day is a balancing act. I have to prioritize my energy and decide which tasks are worth my limited spoons. Simple things like showering or cooking can take hours of recovery time afterward. I’ve learned to celebrate the small victories, like getting out of bed or completing a load of laundry, but it can be hard when others don’t understand the effort it takes.    I also face the challenge of explaining my limitations to friends and family. They often don’t see the struggle behind the scenes and may think I’m just being lazy or unmotivated. It’s frustrating to feel like I have to justify my existence and my choices.     I’m curious to hear from others in this community: how do you cope with the daily demands of living with chronic illness? What strategies have you found helpful in managing your energy and communicating your needs to others? Let’s share our experiences and support each other in this journey.
__label__1 I’m on the hunt for a new romance book, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the options out there! I love stories that have a strong emotional connection between the characters, preferably with a bit of tension and some steamy moments. I’m also a sucker for a good enemies-to-lovers trope or a second chance romance.     If you have any recommendations that fit these themes, I’d love to hear them! Bonus points if the book has a strong female lead or is set in an interesting historical or fantasy setting.     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 It's funny how we often assume that words with similar endings will rhyme, but "patio" and "ratio" don't actually match in sound. It makes you realize that language is full of surprises and exceptions, and sometimes the rules we think we know just don't apply.
__label__1 I’ve been watching Kenny Pickett this season, and I have to say, he might just be the nicest quarterback in the league! I mean, how many QBs do you see actually telling defenders where to go? It’s like he’s out there playing a game of chess while everyone else is just trying to play football.     I remember that one play where he was about to get sacked, and instead of just trying to escape, he calmly pointed out to the defender where he wanted him to go. It’s almost like he’s saying, "Hey, I know you’re trying to tackle me, but how about you take a step to the left?"     It’s refreshing to see a player with such a positive attitude on the field, especially in a sport that can get so intense. I think this speaks volumes about his character and leadership. He’s not just focused on winning; he’s also trying to make the game enjoyable for everyone involved.     What do you all think? Is Pickett the nicest QB in the league, or is there someone else who deserves that title? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I can’t believe it’s finally here! After all the teasing and anticipation, is today the day we get new music or an announcement from Blink-182? I’ve been refreshing their social media all morning, and I’m just so hyped!     I remember when they dropped ‘Nine’ and how excited I was. It feels like forever since we’ve had something new from them. What do you all think? Are we finally getting a new album or maybe a tour announcement? Let’s hope for some good news! 🤞     Also, if they do drop something, what are you hoping to hear? I’m personally hoping for a return to their classic sound mixed with some of the newer vibes they’ve been exploring. Let’s discuss!      #Blink182 #NewMusic #Excited
__label__1 I've been friends with Sarah for over five years. At first, our friendship was great, but over time, I've started to notice some toxic patterns in her behavior. She often belittles my achievements, makes snide comments about my appearance, and tends to turn every conversation back to herself. I’ve tried to talk to her about how I feel, but she always brushes it off and insists that I’m being too sensitive.    Recently, I reached a breaking point when she made a hurtful comment about my job promotion, saying it was just luck and that I didn’t deserve it. I felt crushed and realized that this friendship was affecting my mental health. After a lot of thought, I decided to take a break from our friendship to focus on myself and my well-being.    I told Sarah that I needed some space and explained my reasons. She reacted very negatively, calling me dramatic and saying that I was throwing away our friendship over nothing. Now, I feel guilty for stepping back, but I also know that I need to prioritize my mental health.     AITA for taking a break from a toxic friendship?
__label__1 I wanted to share my experience with microdosing, but unfortunately, it hasn’t gone as I had hoped. I started microdosing with psilocybin about a month ago, aiming to enhance my creativity and improve my mood. I began with a dose of 0.1 grams every three days, following the typical protocol I read about.    At first, I was excited. I felt a slight increase in my energy levels and a bit more focus during my work. However, as the weeks went on, I started to feel more anxious and irritable. I thought maybe it was just a phase, but it didn’t get better. I tried adjusting my dosage, thinking maybe I was too low or too high, but nothing seemed to help.    I also noticed that my sleep quality deteriorated, which was surprising since I had read that microdosing could actually help with sleep for some people. Instead, I found myself tossing and turning, and waking up feeling groggy.     After about a month, I decided to stop completely. I’m feeling a bit disappointed because I really wanted this to work for me. I’ve read so many positive stories about microdosing, and I was hoping to experience similar benefits.     Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’m curious if it’s common to have a rough time with microdosing or if I might have just been doing it wrong. Any advice or insights would be appreciated!
__label__0 Hi everyone, Looking for some advice on Melatonin leading up to Egg retrieval. Do you take 3mg per day or 5mg per day? And do you take time released ones or regular ones? I heard time released ones may be better as it extends the time Melatonin has impact on the eggs. And when do you start and end taking Melatonin? There are discussions online but not quite consistent, some says start at day 1 of the cycle and ends the day before ER, some says day 1 of stims and ends the day before ER, and some says stop before stims… very confusing…    Thank you so much!
__label__1 I'm moving to Singapore soon for work and I'm looking for recommendations on housing options. I would love to hear from locals or expats about their experiences.     1. **Areas to Consider**: Which neighborhoods are best for expats? I’ve heard about places like Orchard, Tiong Bahru, and Holland Village, but I’m open to suggestions based on convenience, amenities, and community vibe.    2. **Types of Housing**: Should I look for a condo, HDB flat, or serviced apartment? What are the pros and cons of each?     3. **Budget**: I have a budget of around SGD 2,500 to SGD 3,500 per month. Is this realistic for a one-bedroom apartment in a decent area?     4. **Rental Process**: Any tips on the rental process? How do I find a good agent, and what should I be aware of in terms of lease agreements and deposits?    5. **Living Essentials**: What should I consider in terms of proximity to public transport, grocery stores, and other essential services?    Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to your insights!
__label__1 I've been trying to search for some mods in the Steam Workshop for a couple of games, but the search function doesn't seem to be working properly. When I enter keywords, it either returns no results or shows a very limited selection that doesn't match what I'm looking for.     I've tried refreshing the page, clearing my browser cache, and even restarting Steam, but nothing seems to help. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?     Are there any tips or tricks to get the Workshop search to work better? Or is this a known issue with Steam right now? Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about a year now, and I’m starting to feel really conflicted about our relationship. Lately, I’ve found myself not wanting to hang out with him as much as I used to. It’s not that I don’t care about him or that I don’t love him, but I just feel this overwhelming sense of fatigue when it comes to spending time together.    We used to have so much fun going out, trying new things, and just enjoying each other’s company. But now, I often find myself making excuses to avoid plans. I feel guilty about it because I know he looks forward to our time together, and I don’t want to hurt his feelings.     I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and personal issues, and I think that’s contributing to my desire to just have some alone time. I also wonder if I’m just going through a phase where I need space, or if there’s something deeper going on in our relationship that I’m not addressing.     I don’t want to break up with him, but I also don’t want to keep forcing myself to hang out when I’m not feeling it. I’m worried that if I tell him how I feel, he might take it the wrong way or feel rejected.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do I approach this situation without hurting him? Should I just be honest about needing some space, or is there a better way to handle it?
__label__1 I've been having some trouble with my HomeKit automations lately. I set up a few automations to control my lights and thermostat based on certain triggers, but they only seem to work the first time I activate them. After that, they don't trigger again unless I manually run them from the Home app.    For example, I have an automation that turns on the living room lights when I arrive home. It works perfectly the first time, but if I leave and come back, it doesn't activate again. I've checked the settings and everything seems to be in order.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? Are there any troubleshooting steps I can take to ensure my automations run consistently? I really want to make the most out of my HomeKit setup, and this is becoming quite frustrating. Thanks in advance for any help!
__label__1 I just had the most chaotic and hilarious match in Team Scorched! For those who haven’t tried it yet, it’s a 6v6 mode where you only have the Scorch Cannon, and let me tell you, it’s pure mayhem.     At first, I thought it would be a bit boring since it’s just one weapon, but the strategy involved is surprisingly deep. You have to be mindful of your positioning, timing your shots, and coordinating with your teammates to maximize damage. I found myself constantly dodging and weaving, trying to avoid getting blasted while also looking for opportunities to take out the enemy team.     The best part? The moments when you manage to pull off a double or triple kill with a well-placed shot. It’s so satisfying! I also love how it forces you to think differently about engagements. You can’t just run in guns blazing; you have to be tactical and patient.     Anyone else enjoying Team Scorched? What strategies have you found that work well? Let’s share some tips and tricks to dominate the battlefield!
__label__1 I've been playing Civilization VI for a while now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the importance of hydroelectric dams in the game.     In my latest playthrough, I focused heavily on science and production, and I found that building hydroelectric dams was a game-changer for my cities. Not only do they provide a significant boost to energy production, but they also help with the overall appeal of the surrounding tiles, which is crucial for tourism later in the game.     I strategically placed my dams near mountain ranges and rivers, maximizing their potential. The extra power allowed me to run more districts and buildings without worrying about energy shortages. Plus, the floodplain tiles became incredibly valuable, turning my cities into economic powerhouses.     However, I did face some challenges. I had to be mindful of the environmental impact, as building too many dams can lead to negative consequences like flooding. It made me think about balancing my energy needs with the ecological aspects of my civilization.     Overall, I think hydroelectric dams are an underappreciated aspect of Civ VI. They not only provide essential resources but also add a layer of strategy when planning city layouts. Has anyone else had a similar experience with dams, or do you prefer other energy sources? Would love to hear your thoughts!

I actually don't mind Poliwhirl-- despite it being the mid evolution and *usually* mid evolutions are a little meh. It's a boring design; In the sense that it grows more frog like and grows arms and legs. But I still think Poliwhirl is pretty charming! For a mid evolution it's sticks out in memory, at least.    Like I said before, Poliwhirl is pretty boring design wise in the fact that very little changes-- but I also like the simplistic look to it. It's the perfect mid look between Poliwag and Poliwrath. I feel like GameFreak tried to demonstrate natural looking evolutions for the mid stages rather than trying too hard to make them specific pokemon and I can't really fault them for it.    I remember Poliwhirl more than Wrath from the Pokemon manga, actually. Pictures are down but the Pokemon manga is **brutal!** My immediate thought when I was thinking of topics for this post was Red's Poliwhirl and the fact that it *literally got skewered by a Fearow*. That poor guy went through a lot for being a middle stage!    Poliwhirl's shiny is also boring-- following the same exact pattern as Poliwag in the fact that it *hardly changes*. It just turns a lighter shade of blue. I really wonder how come this line was spared from the "blue = pink" pattern later shinies get.    Overall, I don't have a lot to say about Poliwhirl. It has a fair bit more character than Poliwag but it loses that endearing adorableness that Poliwag had. All in all I think I'll put it in **C.**     \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I hope you enjoyed my ramblings! A little earlier today since I'm unavailable for most of the night! Let me know what you think of Poliwhirl, I'd love to hear it!    See ya tomorrow\~    \~Emi    (061/905+)

__label__1 I recently got a Star Wars tattoo and I couldn't be more excited about it! It's a design of the Rebel Alliance symbol intertwined with a lightsaber, and I chose to have it on my forearm.

For me, this tattoo represents my love for the franchise and the values of hope and resistance that the Rebels stand for. I’ve been a fan since I was a kid, and Star Wars has always been a source of inspiration for me.     I’d love to see your Star Wars tattoos! What do you have, and what do they mean to you?

__label__0 I just got a new Logitech G502. I'm using the Logitech G Hub for the first time.    I'm trying to assign keyboard keys to certain buttons. When looking under KEYS it only allows me to set individual key strokes to mouse buttons. Keys like "a", "y", ","(comma), etc...    How do I set modified key combinations like "SHIFT+A" or "CTRL+ALT+G", etc?    I've found that I can create a macro that does a key combo like this and assign the macro. But is that really the only option? That seems very short sighted on Logitech's part if that is the only way to do it...
__label__1 I recently picked up my prescription for Zoloft, and I noticed that there are 28 pills in the box, but there are also two pills that are separate from the rest. I’m a bit confused about this. Is this a common practice?     I’ve been on Zoloft for a while now, and I’ve never seen this before. Are those two separate pills meant to be a backup in case I lose one or miss a dose? Or is there some other reason for the extra pills?     I’d love to hear if anyone else has experienced this or knows why it’s done this way. Thanks!

__label__1 In recent years, many users have become increasingly concerned about their online privacy, leading to a surge in interest around custom startpages. These are personalized homepages that can be set up to display your favorite links, news, weather, and more, often with a focus on privacy.    However, the question remains: is it safe to use a custom startpage from a privacy perspective?    The answer largely depends on the provider of the startpage. Some custom startpages are designed with privacy in mind, meaning they do not track your browsing habits, do not collect personal data, and do not serve ads. Examples of such privacy-focused startpages include Startpage, DuckDuckGo, and others that emphasize user anonymity.    On the other hand, some startpage services may collect data on your usage patterns, which can be used for targeted advertising or sold to third parties. This is particularly true for services that are free to use, as they often rely on data collection to generate revenue.     When considering a custom startpage, here are a few tips to ensure your privacy:  1. **Research the provider**: Look for reviews and privacy policies. Ensure they have a clear stance on data collection and user privacy.  2. **Check for HTTPS**: Make sure the startpage uses HTTPS to encrypt your connection, which helps protect your data from eavesdroppers.  3. **Look for open-source options**: Some custom startpages are open-source, allowing the community to audit their code for privacy issues.  4. **Avoid services that require personal information**: If a startpage asks for personal details to set up an account, it may not be the best choice for privacy.    Ultimately, using a custom startpage can be safe for your privacy if you choose the right provider. Always stay informed and vigilant about how your data is being handled. What are your experiences with custom startpages? Have you found any that prioritize privacy effectively?

__label__1 I’m currently on day 3 of my period and I feel like I’m dying. The cramps are so intense that I can barely move, and I’m experiencing this awful bloating that makes me feel like I’m going to explode. On top of that, I’m super irritable and emotional—like, I cried over a commercial yesterday!     I’ve tried heating pads, pain relievers, and even some herbal teas, but nothing seems to help. I just want to curl up in a ball and forget the world exists.     Does anyone else experience these kinds of symptoms? What do you do to cope? I’m starting to wonder if I should talk to my doctor about this because it feels like it’s getting worse every month. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I just posted pics of my new to me Lexus here last week. After a week of driving, I’ve come to get to know the vehicle a bit better but I need some answers/advice from long time Lexus owners. Hope you guys can help.     For reference car has 230,000 Kms or about 143,000 miles     1. Door locks. I purchased the car knowing that only the passenger front door locks and unlocks with the key fob or the inside button. All other locks have to be toggled manually. Previous owner says it’s the actuators… I just find it hard to believe that all three would go out at once - unless they went out one at a time without him fixing any of it - but regardless of when, to have 3 actuators go bad on a vehicle is unheard of to me. Any idea what’s going on? Some have told me the actuators tend to be a weak point in these… any truth to it?  Could it be electrical?      2. I tried to program the memory seats, set button beeped once I then pressed 1, but it did not set the memory. I’ve never heard the beep again no matter how many times I press set. Did the switch just fry?       3. According to the seller they haven’t driven the car much or nearly at all since Covid started. Means they drove it from year 1-9 but haven’t all the way through year 12. When I was taking the car home the first time the tpms light came on. Figured no biggie. Probably just needs air. Turns out all tires were OVERinflated. I corrected it and set all tires to 30 psi as per the door sticker but tpms light did not go away. It tends to blink for about a minute when the car starts the. Stays steady the rest of the time. Bad sensors?       4. Happened just once. Ac did not turn on when the car was started. Just a bug?      5. Noticed blower motor fan is noisy. Is this about the time to be doing a replacement?       Any and all help much appreciated guys. I love the car and I hope I can bring it back to its former glory before the end of the summer.

Here are some tips:    1. **Explore the New Areas**: Take some time to explore the new areas unlocked after Alterena. There are often hidden collectibles, new gear, and secrets waiting to be discovered.    2. **Level Up Your Gear**: Focus on leveling up your gear by playing different modes. The more you use a piece of gear, the more abilities you can unlock. Try to mix and match to find the best combinations for your playstyle.    3. **Participate in Splatfests**: If there’s a Splatfest happening, make sure to participate! It’s a great way to earn exclusive rewards and test your skills against other players.    4. **Practice in the Training Room**: Use the training room to practice your aim and learn the mechanics of different weapons. This can help you improve your performance in competitive matches.    5. **Join a Squad**: Consider joining or forming a squad with friends or other players. Playing with a team can enhance your strategy and make matches more enjoyable.    6. **Check Out the Shop**: Regularly visit the shops to see if there are new items or gear available. Sometimes, special items are only available for a limited time.    7. **Engage with the Community**: Join discussions on forums or social media to share your experiences and learn from others. The Splatoon community is vibrant and full of tips and tricks.    8. **Experiment with Different Weapons**: Don’t be afraid to try out different weapons and playstyles.

These can often provide a fun change of pace from regular matches.    10. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on patch notes and updates from the developers. Changes to weapons, maps, and game mechanics can significantly impact your gameplay.    Enjoy your time in Splatoon 3, and happy splatting!
__label__1 I am currently working on my university capstone project, which is a significant component of my degree program. As part of this project, I am required to log a certain number of hours dedicated to project management activities to fulfill my PMP certification requirements.     The project involves developing a mobile application aimed at improving student engagement on campus. I have been managing a small team of fellow students, and we are in the process of defining our project scope, creating a project plan, and establishing timelines.     However, I am finding it challenging to track my hours effectively while also ensuring that my team stays on task and meets our deadlines. I want to make sure that I am documenting my project management activities accurately to meet the requirements for my PMP hours.     Here are a few questions I have:  1. What are the best practices for logging project management hours in a university setting?  2. How can I balance the need to document my hours while also focusing on the execution of the project?  3. Are there any tools or templates that you would recommend for tracking project management activities and hours?    Any advice or insights from those who have navigated similar situations would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I’m relatively new to Photoshop so maybe this is nothing more than a simple fix, but everything I’ve tried searching to fix this issue has come up with no promising results.    For context, I use Layer Masks ALOT especially Solid Color ones however recently when I use the brush tool on the inverted Layer mask the brush ends up transparent. My layer opacity is on normal, it’s at 100% opacity. My brush itself is 100% opacity, 100% Flow 0% Smoothing and 100% hardness. I’ve tried everything from trying new files to resetting every tool I have, I still can’t find a fix.    Does anyone have any suggestions?
__label__0 So i changed my nozzle on my stock ender 3 pro from 0.4 to 0.2 because i wanted to print minies with better detail. After changing it i went to the controls and tried to extrude a couple of mm but nothing happened. A little plastic bubbled at the end of the nozzle and that's it. I am pretty new to this so any help is appreciated.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm in the market for a new gaming monitor and could really use some advice. I'm looking for something that can handle fast-paced games, so a high refresh rate is a must. I've been considering options around 144Hz or even 240Hz if my budget allows.     I also want to make sure the monitor has good color accuracy and decent response times, as I play a mix of competitive shooters and story-driven games.     I've heard a lot about both IPS and TN panels, but I'm not sure which would be better for my needs. Is it worth spending a bit more for an IPS panel for the better colors and viewing angles, or should I stick with a TN panel for the faster response times?     Additionally, any recommendations on specific models would be greatly appreciated! My budget is around $300-$500. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 Insecurity can manifest in various ways, and it's not uncommon for people who feel insecure to experience envy towards others. This envy might stem from a perception that others have qualities, achievements, or relationships that they lack. However, feeling insecure doesn't necessarily mean that someone hates others; rather, it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and comparison.    When someone is insecure, they might project their feelings onto others, which can sometimes come off as resentment or negativity. This doesn't mean they genuinely hate those people; it often reflects their internal struggles and dissatisfaction with themselves.     It's important to recognize that these feelings are complex. Insecurity can lead to a cycle of negative emotions, where one might feel envious and then react defensively or negatively towards those they envy.     Have you ever felt this way? How do you think insecurity affects relationships and perceptions of others?

__label__1 When someone commits suicide by jumping off a high bridge into water, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, the actual cause of death can vary depending on several factors. The most immediate cause is often the impact with the water, which can be fatal due to the high velocity of the fall. The impact can cause severe injuries, including broken bones, internal injuries, or even immediate death upon hitting the water.    However, if the person survives the initial impact, drowning can become the next cause of death. The shock of the cold water, potential unconsciousness from the impact, or inability to swim can all contribute to drowning. Additionally, if the person is incapacitated or injured, they may not be able to keep their head above water, leading to drowning.    In some cases, if the person survives both the fall and the water, they may still face life-threatening conditions such as hypothermia, especially in colder waters, which can also lead to death if not rescued in time.    Overall, the cause of death in such cases is often a combination of trauma from the fall and drowning, with the specific circumstances determining the final outcome.
__label__1 I've been thinking about the idea of banning omni-food in my living space, and I wanted to get some thoughts from the community.     As a vegan, I feel strongly about my dietary choices and the ethical implications behind them. However, I live with non-vegan roommates who often bring home meat and dairy products. The smell and presence of these foods can be quite triggering for me, and I find it difficult to maintain my commitment to veganism in an environment where animal products are constantly around.     I’m considering having a conversation with my roommates about creating a vegan-only zone in our shared kitchen or even banning omni-food entirely from our living spaces. I want to approach this in a way that respects their choices while also standing firm in my beliefs.     Have any of you faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? What are some tips for having this conversation without causing conflict? I’d love to hear your experiences and advice!

__label__0 TW: Mention of suicidal tendencies      From the age of 11 I had crippling anxiety that I struggled with for 6 years. It was the only thing I knew for a while and I did not remember NOT having trouble each and every day of my life. I practically wasted my years of being a teenager, or I guess a better word to use would be "lost" because I already accepted that it wasn't my fault.    Nobody in my family believes me or treats me like another human - at the age of 18 I'm still a dumb child to them. That's why I'll describe my progress here, to strangers.     Last year I started medication after I unfortunately had to "threaten" my parents. That's what they said it was. I almost committed suicide almost three years ago and I had to tell my school counsellor about it. It took me a year to get myself to tell someone.  To avoid being seen as "bad parents" they allowed me to get help and the doctor I went to begged them to also allow me to get medication as my case was very severe.      Right now I'm one year medicated on a double basic dosage which works for me. The last year of school I made a friend. A REAL friend. I talked to teachers, other people, I could go ask for HELP with schoolwork. I kept amazing myself more and more and as sad as it sounds, I finally remembered what happiness feels like.   Last week I did something unremarkable that I thought was impossible for years and years.    I applied for a job. I made 5 phone calls. I scheduled a doctors visit. All in one week.    I know this sounds stupid for regular people but I'm tearing up just writing this. I still cannot believe that everything got better. I did it with 0 support from my family. Against all odds and in a terrible environment I'm actually doing normal stuff and being CONFIDENT.    Still, I have a long way to go. Wish me luck!
__label__1 I've been thinking about this question for a while, and honestly, I think I would want to be banned from r/NoFap. Not because I have anything against the community or the message, but because I feel like it would be a sign that I've overcome my struggles with addiction and have moved on to a healthier lifestyle.     Being banned would mean that I no longer need the support or the reminders of my past habits. It would signify personal growth and a step towards a more balanced life.     What about you? Which subreddit would you want to be banned from and why?
__label__0 OHhh boy, where the hell do i start? How about with a possible trigger warning. Ever since I could remember my mother would FREAK OUT when I accidentally locked my bed/bathroom door as a child, started banging and shouting and DEMANDED that I opened it. It makes sense not to be allowed to lock the door until a certain age but moving on, an incident happened where I was talking to someone I shouldn’t have, but wasn’t none the wiser at 10. The way she handled it was pretty traumatic. Won’t clarify since someone I know browses through my reddit profile sometimes. She went through every single app I had on my phone and sat me down and yelled at me, ridiculed and humiliated me about every single thing. And I was being taken advantage of. A whole bunch of guilt tripping and trying to install paranoia into me. Ever since has used it as an excuse and then built off of it until it was “I’m not allowed to have privacy.” Would regularly snoop through my phone and one time when I was 13 got mad at my friend for swearing in a text message??? It wasn’t even in a negative sentence and wasn’t that bad of a word. So I’m part of the LGBT+ community, my mom found my pride stuff and I made up a story where people i made up i was friends with put stuff in my bag as a joke. She made me throw it all away and was going to go up to my school about it, but forgot to. Ever since at the end of the school year she takes my bag and goes through every pocket and reads every paper in my folders. More incidents happened where I made a story up, like the one where she read my diary out loud and question me about it while all 3 of us were in the same room. Each incident would cause me to loose more and more privacy privileges.     Given she is insufferable to be around, I only feel safe in my room where she isn’t. Every. Single. Day. She’ll make up an excuse (if i’m awake) to come in my room and literally does a whole scan of my room and then walks to the other side of my bed, literally LOOKING for something to yell at me for. So I keep food in my room cause I’d rather starve than go downstairs knowing I could end up getting insulted or yelled at etc. I try to keep non-parish able items or things in boxes like mini tuna kits. I don’t always have time to throw away food before school so I would hide it &amp; throw it out when I came back. Every time she found food, after awhile, would take the furniture I hid behind it, and now is saying I’m only going to have my bed (which is a mattress on the floor) in my room as a consequence. (Perfectly good reason to take my bookshelf and all my books right? Even though there’s no room to hide food there?) I still have my tv and a mini foldable table thing but that’s it. I have one more shelf though which is also my tv stand. I have decorations however. She also determines what clothes I have can go in my closet at the time and keeps the rest in bins in my parent’s room which she now has a lock on. She put it on one day and it wasn’t connected to any other event, although    I had to hide my school issued ipad because she is going to take it and go through it like last year during the summer. My friend is hiding it cause I also need it to post my weekly comic pages but ANYWAYS i’m posting this on my personal ipad which she took. During june 2020 she took my phone and went through it (the incident when I was 13) and cut me off from the world and took all my technology. that kinda made me go crazy and I still am but not as delusional, mostly sort of. I couldn’t communicate with anyone and didn’t go anywhere most of the time.    She’s CONVINCED it’s in my room and is now going to clear out my room i overheard to find it.     I’ve been exhausted for a very long time....

__label__1 I've been doing bike deliveries for UberEATS for about six months now, and I wanted to share my experience regarding mileage. On average, I cover about 10-15 miles per shift, depending on the area I'm delivering in and how busy it is.     During peak hours, I find that I can get more orders in a shorter amount of time, which sometimes leads to longer distances if the orders are spread out. On slower days, I might only do around 5-8 miles.     I keep track of my mileage for tax purposes, and I’ve found that using an app to log my trips has been really helpful. It’s important to note that the mileage can vary greatly based on the location and the time of day.     For those of you who are also doing bike deliveries, how does your mileage compare? Any tips on maximizing efficiency while keeping the mileage down?

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I just wanted to ask about the onsite confirmation process for our upcoming classes. I’ve heard mixed reviews about how it works and what to expect.

Also, is there a chance that we might encounter any issues during the confirmation? I just want to be as prepared as possible. Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 NDQ (Not dumb question, as the only dumb question is the one you don't ask :) )    Play Rumble a lot, but still down there in rank. I have a hell of a time using Spike, enough said. Question, is there some condition where Spike activates automatically?    I've seen many many goal replays where the ball is spiked just as it touches a car, almost always as they are on the ground and the ball is right at their windshield. I seriously doubt there are that many gold players who hit spike at exactly the same tenth of a second over and over, am I wrong?
__label__1 I've been on a ketamine treatment plan for a few months now, and I wanted to share my experience regarding the effects I've noticed, particularly in relation to dissociation and psychedelic experiences.     Initially, I was quite apprehensive about the potential for dissociation, as I had read mixed reviews about how people react to ketamine. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my sessions have been relatively mild in terms of those effects.     During my treatments, I often feel a sense of calm and relaxation without the intense dissociative experiences that some describe. Instead of feeling detached from reality, I find that I am more in tune with my thoughts and emotions. It’s as if the fog has lifted, allowing me to process things more clearly.     I’ve noticed significant improvements in my mood and anxiety levels, which I attribute to the ketamine therapy. I feel more motivated and engaged in my daily life, and my depressive symptoms have lessened considerably.     For anyone who is concerned about the psychedelic effects, I would say that it’s possible to experience therapeutic benefits without the intense dissociation. It really varies from person to person, and I think it’s important to communicate with your provider about your experiences and any concerns you may have.     Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’d love to hear your stories!

__label__1 I am reaching out to this wonderful community in hopes of finding support for an elderly Afghan couple who are in dire need of assistance. They have been living in a small apartment in our city, but due to unforeseen circumstances, they have found themselves without food and water.     The couple, both in their late 70s, fled Afghanistan seeking safety and a better life, but the challenges they face here have been overwhelming. They have limited resources and are struggling to make ends meet. With rising costs of living and their fixed income, they are unable to afford basic necessities.     I have been helping them as much as I can, but my resources are running low. They need immediate help with food and water, as well as some assistance with their utility bills to ensure they have a warm place to stay during the colder months.     I have set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for their urgent needs. Every little bit helps, and I know that together we can make a difference in their lives. If you can contribute, share this post, or even just send some positive thoughts their way, it would mean the world to them.     Thank you for taking the time to read this. I truly appreciate any support you can provide.     [My GoFundMe link](https://gofund.me/3e4f5a6b)
__label__1 Lately, I've been feeling really down because of my neighbors. They are constantly loud, playing music late at night and having parties that go on for hours. I’ve tried talking to them about it, but it feels like they don’t care at all. It’s like I have no peace in my own home, and it’s really affecting my mental health.     I already struggle with depression, and this situation is just making everything worse. I feel trapped and helpless, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve considered reaching out to my landlord, but I worry it might escalate things or make my neighbors retaliate.     I just want to feel safe and comfortable in my own space. Has anyone else dealt with difficult neighbors? How did you cope with it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 So, I just wanted to share my experience with trying to summon the award guy! I’ve seen a few different methods floating around, and honestly, it’s all just for fun, but it’s kind of become a little tradition in our friend group.     First, you have to gather your friends and create a circle (or just sit in a group chat if you’re online). Then, you all have to chant something like "Award Guy, come to us!" while doing a silly dance. The sillier, the better!     After that, you can either wait in silence or start sharing your favorite memes or funny stories. The idea is that the more fun you have, the more likely he is to show up.     I’ve done this a few times, and sometimes we actually get awards! Other times, it’s just a good laugh. Either way, it’s a great way to bond with friends and lighten the mood.     Has anyone else tried summoning him? What’s your experience? Let’s hear your stories!

__label__1 # My Fix for Tortle’s Shell Defense    I've been playing around with the Tortle race from *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, and while I love the concept of their Shell Defense ability, I feel it could use some tweaking to make it more balanced and versatile. Here’s my proposed fix:    ## Shell Defense (Revised)    **As a bonus action, you can withdraw into your shell. While in your shell, you gain the following benefits:**    1. **Armor Class Increase:** Your AC increases by 2, as your shell provides additional protection. This stacks with any armor you are wearing.  2. **Damage Resistance:** You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while in your shell.  3. **Movement Restriction:** You cannot move or take actions while in your shell, but you can still speak and use your bonus action to exit your shell.  4. **Shell Recovery:** If you are reduced to 0 hit points while in your shell, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you remain conscious and can take actions on your next turn, but you are still incapacitated until you exit your shell.  5. **Exit Shell:** You can exit your shell as a bonus action, ending the effects of Shell Defense.    ### Additional Notes:  - **Duration:** The effects of Shell Defense last until you choose to exit your shell or until you are incapacitated.  - **Limitations:** You can only use Shell Defense once per short or long rest to prevent it from being spammed in combat.    ## Rationale  The original Shell Defense ability allowed Tortles to become nearly invulnerable while in their shell, which could lead to unbalanced gameplay, especially in lower-level campaigns. By adding a saving throw mechanic and limiting the number of uses, I hope to encourage more strategic use of the ability rather than just relying on it as a "get out of jail free" card.    I believe this revised version maintains the flavor of the Tortle's unique defensive capabilities while ensuring that it doesn't overshadow other classes or races.     What do you all think? Is this a step in the right direction for balancing the Tortle race? Any feedback or suggestions for further improvements would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I know exactly who you're talking to right now. Do you know how much I make a year? I mean it's a pretty reasonable amount of money, you can probably estimate it. If I suddenly stopped going into work it would probably change nothing, the business goes on. So you clearly know who you're talking to. No need to clue you in. I'm in danger, Skyler. I am not the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? Yes. I am not the one who knocks.
__label__1 As a kid, I had this super embarrassing moment that still makes me cringe to this day. I was in elementary school and really wanted to impress my classmates, so I asked my dad to throw a party for my friends. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to show off my skills in a video game we all loved, where you could fight against the ‘bad guys’ in the game.     So, I told my dad, "Can we have a party so I can beat all the bad guys in class?" I meant it in a fun way, like I wanted to show them how good I was at the game. But my dad took it literally and thought I was talking about fighting or something! He ended up telling my mom, and they both had a good laugh about it.     When I finally realized what I had said, I was mortified! I could just imagine my classmates thinking I was some kind of weirdo who wanted to beat them up. Thankfully, the party went well, and we all had a great time playing games, but I still remember that moment vividly. It’s funny now, but back then, I just wanted to disappear!     What about you guys? What’s your most embarrassing moment from childhood that you’re still trying to move on from?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I just wanted to reach out because I’ve been feeling really lonely lately. It’s like I’m surrounded by people, but I still feel this emptiness inside. I’ve tried to connect with friends and family, but it seems like no one really understands what I’m going through.     I’m not sure if it’s just a phase or if I’m going through something deeper, but I find myself spending a lot of time alone and it’s starting to take a toll on me. I miss having meaningful conversations and just hanging out with someone who gets me.     I’ve thought about trying to meet new people, but the idea of putting myself out there is really daunting. I guess I’m just looking for some advice or maybe even some support from anyone who’s felt this way before. How do you cope with loneliness? How do you find new friends?     Thanks for listening.
__label__0 I am 32, Canadian PR, single (and intend to always be). I have a pending green card application as my father who is a US citizen has sponsored me, so I might move to the US in 2023-24 (not sure if that matters but just saying). Maybe I’d also like to buy a house around that time but I currently rent (but HISA seems too boring).     Have around $100k in savings lying in a zero-interest savings account since 8 years like an idiot and I’m finally waking up and reading up on “how/where to invest” since last week (thanks to this sub).    -Started a TFSA with Wealthsimple robo-advisor last week with a 65/35 allocation (might bump that up to 90/10 soon after reading around).     -Also opened a margin and TFSA account on QT since over half of my savings are in my USD denominated TD bank a/c and I want to avoid conversion fees.    -Now I know I need to max out my TFSAs but I want to start slow so I’ll be putting in smaller amounts over time to buy ETFs.     -The reason to open a QT Margin a/c was because my very knowledgeable friend has suggested getting into “selling covered calls and cash secured puts” on a weekly basis with some of this money, for a regular income flow rather than just holding ETFs in a TFSA, as these seem relatively low risk options based on what I’ve been reading. Ofcourse I would be starting small and picking good stocks and strike prices, etc. upon his guidance as I’m a total newbie with an amount I can afford to lose if things went south.    **I just needed some sort of guideline on how much funds should I look at allocating towards TFSA (long hold ETFs) vs Margin (options) at any given point as a starting guideline?**     50-50? 75-25? Some other number?
__label__1 If you're looking for African high fantasy, I highly recommend checking out the works of Nnedi Okorafor and Tade Thompson. Both authors weave rich narratives that draw heavily from African culture, mythology, and history, creating immersive worlds that feel both familiar and fantastical.    Nnedi Okorafor's "Binti" series is a great starting point. It follows a young Himba woman who is the first of her people to be accepted into a prestigious intergalactic university. The story beautifully blends science fiction with African traditions, exploring themes of identity, belonging, and the power of knowledge. The world-building is intricate, and the characters are deeply relatable, making it a must-read for anyone interested in African-inspired fantasy.    Tade Thompson's "Rosewater" is another fantastic choice. Set in Nigeria, it features a city that has been transformed by an alien biodome that has healing properties. The protagonist, Kaaro, is a psychic who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that challenges his understanding of reality and his place in the world. Thompson's writing is sharp and engaging, and he does an excellent job of incorporating elements of Nigerian culture into a speculative fiction framework.    Additionally, you might want to explore "The Gilded Ones" by Namina Forna, which is a powerful story about female empowerment set in a world where girls are tested for purity and those who fail are deemed "impure" and face dire consequences. The book is rich with themes of resilience and sisterhood, and it draws on West African mythology to create a compelling narrative.    These authors are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to African high fantasy. There are many more voices emerging in the genre, and I encourage everyone to dive into these stories that offer fresh perspectives and vibrant worlds. What are some of your favorite African fantasy reads?
__label__0 Is there a setting to make it so the biter nests are uniform size no matter how far away you go? It seems like they get bigger the farther out.
__label__0 I can speak to running in the morning after overeating. Sometimes I overeat the previous day and do a guilt run the next day. All that extra food + the run seems to even out, I don't get hungrier. The other big advantage is idle time is shortened (less time to even think about hunger).    My issue is that running when actually striving for a deficit is not nearly as fun. After the first 10 days the body puts me into this zombie state and the run becomes a chore.    I am thinking of getting into biking since it's less intense. Does anyone know if say a 2 or 3 hour bike ride with audiobooks to stay interested/engaged is a strong combo to build a morning deficit?
__label__0 Stupidest thing to have ever existed. Eventually people get to know you anyway. It may as well be a second full-time job. Nobody cares how you actually are, and everyone else seems to be masking anyway (not in the same way maybe, but still). I’m just sick and tired of having to play this stupid game. And the moment you take off the mask, everyone thinks you’re having a terrible day or that you hate them and won’t stop pestering you either way, even if you’re actually feeling fine but just didn’t feel like fake smiling or talking to people like they’re 3 years old with the stupid tone inflections people have.  And it doesn’t even stop when you’re alone. If you just want time to yourself for a bit and you turn your phone off for a day or so, you come back with texts that read “Why are you avoiding me!” or “Are you mad at me? Tell me what’a wrong!”    Anyway hope you guys had a good weekend, thanks for listening to my rant since therapists are ridiculously expensive and good ones are hard to find anyway.
__label__1 Snap Inc. (SNAP) is taking a significant hit today, down 22% in early trading. This sharp decline comes after the company reported disappointing earnings and provided a bleak outlook for the upcoming quarter.     Key points from the earnings report include:  - Revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, coming in at $1.07 billion versus the anticipated $1.14 billion.  - Daily active users (DAUs) grew only modestly, with an increase of just 1% year-over-year, raising concerns about user engagement and growth potential.  - The company cited increased competition from TikTok and other social media platforms as a major factor impacting its performance.  - Snap also announced that it would be cutting costs, including layoffs, to improve profitability moving forward.    The market's reaction has been swift, with many investors expressing concerns about Snap's ability to compete in a crowded social media landscape. The stock's drop is also reflective of broader market sentiment, as tech stocks have been under pressure recently due to rising interest rates and inflation concerns.    For those considering options trading, this volatility could present opportunities for both puts and calls, depending on how you view Snap's recovery potential in the coming months. Keep an eye on the support levels and any potential bounce back as the market digests this news.

__label__0   Age: 40  Sex: female  Height: 5’5  Weight: 180  Race: white  Duration: not sure, but blood labs have been all over the map for about a year) I’ve included the most recent one that has me concerned.     Relevant Info: My blood labs are showing some elevations that I need help interpreting. I’ve gained weight over the last 2 years but am currently dieting (vegetarian) and exercising daily and the scale is moving in the right direction.     Medications: Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (every other day), Klor-con 10meq, Adderall XR 30mg, Clonidine .1 mg, levothyroxine 100 mcg, Deplin 15mg (methylated folate), 2mg Xanax as needed, but I’ve been taking between 1-2 mg every night for a few weeks (my job really realllly sucks- I’m looking for another one. I do not intend to stay on Xanax)    Issue: I’ve had blurry vision that comes and goes and I probably get 10-15 migraines a month (this started two years ago). I’m always tired and just don’t have much energy. My face is always red, it’s just my face and I do not go in the sun and wear sunscreen daily. I can’t feel the outside of my left outer thigh, it’s either numb, tingling or burning-that started about two years ago too. I’ve been having issues with polycythemia for the last 6 years or so but it’s historically been the only lab value consistently elevated- but this is the highest I can remember seeing it. My most recent labs are due to be re-run but I can’t stop worrying about the weird elevations. What could that mean? My doctor suggested getting tested for hemochromatosis due to the iron levels but money is a concern for me right now. I never should have gotten on Dr google but could my labs be indicative of polycythemia Vera? Is it worth getting the hemochromatosis genetic test? My dad gives blood every week and has elevated hematocrit too, but I also know he takes testosterone so it may be unrelated to what’s going on with me. I don’t know what my Dads blood labs look like though. I was told a few years ago to go give blood to reduce my levels but I almost fainted when I did so now I’m freaked out about doing it again.  I know mild elevations aren’t always something to worry about, but it’s the consistent elevation and the new elevations that I am curious about. Are these lab values something I need to be concerned about and should I prioritize getting more tests done asap? Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear your thoughts. I’ve included all of the flagged values.

__label__0 Throwaway because he knows my main and I (F22) introduced him (M26) to Reddit. Also reposted, forgot a TL;DR.    Ever since moving in two months ago with my boyfriend of 3 years, things have been going okay except for one thing. On the weekends, we do spend time together, but sometimes (especially Sunday night) my boyfriend will play a very popular MMO title that we've all heard of for 5 to 7 hours every night. I sometimes walk over to him and hold him for a bit, but then he kinda just looks back at his screen. I don't expect him to coddle me 24/7 but sometimes he won't talk to me for hours and I'm literally only a few feet away from him. I sometimes get in a Discord call with him and his friends, but I don't know what to say and I mostly just end up listening to him playing the game.    This past weekend worried me. He didn't get anything to eat for dinner (I even mentioned to him that I could cook something for him but he didn't really give me an answer) and only took like 2 bathroom breaks. I am starting to worry about this game taking over his life, and worrying that the future of our relationship (especially if we have kids). I understand that with COVID going on there isn't a whole lot to do, but I feel like he isn't putting forth effort to realize what he's doing (or not doing, for lack of a better term).    Do I bring this up to him? I feel like he would get depressed after realizing what he's done, or maybe his friends would hate me or something. Maybe I'm just blowing this whole situation out of proportion and going stir crazy.    TL;DR: Boyfriend keeps playing MMO for 5 to 7 hours straight every night, sometimes without taking a meal break, worried he might become more addicted to it.
__label__1 My daughter just turned 4, and I’m starting to wonder if some of her behaviors are typical for her age. She has a vivid imagination and loves to play pretend, which I know is normal, but she also has some moments that leave me scratching my head.     For instance, she often insists that her stuffed animals are real and gets really upset if I accidentally treat them like toys. She’ll have full conversations with them and even gets mad if I don’t respond to them as if they were real. Is this kind of imaginative play common at this age?     Additionally, she has started to show some signs of anxiety, especially when it comes to new situations or meeting new people. She clings to me and sometimes refuses to participate in activities unless I’m right there with her. I try to encourage her to be brave and explore, but I don’t want to push her too hard.     I’m also noticing that she can be quite stubborn and has frequent meltdowns over small things, like not getting the snack she wants or if her toys are not arranged just right. I’ve read that this can be part of her developing independence, but it can be exhausting!     So, I guess my question is: is this normal behavior for a 4-year-old? How do you all handle similar situations? Any tips or reassurance would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I just wanted to share some good news regarding the Fire TV Cube 2nd generation. After the recent software update, I noticed that the micro-stutter and frame skipping issues that have been plaguing the device for a while now seem to have been resolved!     I was watching a few shows on Prime Video and noticed a significant improvement in playback smoothness. No more annoying stutters during action scenes or while scrolling through menus. It feels like the device is finally performing as it should have from the start.     Has anyone else experienced this improvement? I’m curious to know if others are seeing the same results or if it’s just my unit. Let’s hope this fix sticks around and that Amazon continues to optimize the Fire TV Cube!     Happy streaming!

__label__1 When you filled your bathtub and noticed the water was light blue, it could be due to a few reasons, but one common cause is copper. Copper can dissolve into the water from pipes, especially if the water is slightly acidic or if the pipes are old. This can happen more often in areas with soft water, which can corrode pipes more easily.    Now, about drinking the tap water: if you have a PUR water filter, it’s designed to remove many contaminants, including some metals like copper. However, it’s important to check the specific model of your filter to see what it removes. Generally, using a water filter can make your tap water safer to drink, but it’s always a good idea to test your water if you notice unusual colors or tastes.    If you’re concerned about the safety of your water, you might want to consider getting it tested, especially if you see blue water regularly. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid drinking the tap water until you’re sure it’s safe.
__label__1 Recently, there have been multiple reports from users experiencing issues with their RTX 4090 graphics cards, specifically regarding the power cables burning or melting. This has raised significant concerns within the gaming community and among PC builders.     Nvidia has acknowledged these reports and is currently investigating the situation. Users have shared images and videos showing damaged cables, which appear to be related to the 16-pin power connector used by the RTX 4090. Some users have speculated that the issue may stem from improper connections or the use of low-quality power supplies, while others believe it could be a design flaw in the cable itself.    Nvidia has urged users to ensure that their power connectors are securely attached and to use high-quality power supplies that meet the necessary specifications for the RTX 4090. They are also working with manufacturers to address any potential issues and ensure the safety and reliability of their products.    If you own an RTX 4090, it might be a good idea to check your power connections and monitor your system for any unusual behavior. Have any of you experienced this issue? What steps have you taken to mitigate the risk? Let's discuss!
__label__1 I just had a hilarious moment while playing Mafia: The Game that I had to share! So, I was in the middle of a mission where I had to take out a rival gang member. I thought I was being all stealthy, sneaking around the gas station, but I accidentally bumped into a gas pump and set off the alarm!     Suddenly, all the NPCs started freaking out, and I had to scramble to take cover while the cops showed up. It turned into a full-blown shootout right in the middle of the gas station! I ended up taking out the target, but not without causing a massive scene.     Has anyone else had a similar experience where a simple mission turned into chaos? What’s your funniest or most unexpected moment in the game? Let’s hear your stories!
__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but I’ve been rewatching some classic shows and I can’t help but feel that the sequel episodes often bring a fresh perspective that the originals sometimes lack. For example, I recently revisited the sequel episode of a popular sitcom that originally aired in the 90s, and I found myself laughing even harder than I did with the original.     The character development in the sequel was so much richer, and the humor felt more relatable to my experiences today. It’s like the writers had a chance to reflect on what worked and what didn’t, and they really nailed it in the follow-up.     Does anyone else feel this way? Are there specific sequel episodes that you think outshine their originals? Let’s discuss! I’d love to hear your thoughts and recommendations!

__label__1 I've been job hunting for a while now, and one thing that's really frustrating me is the discrepancy between posted salaries and what companies are actually willing to pay. I see job listings that advertise a salary range that seems decent, but when I go through the interview process, the offers come in significantly lower than expected.     For example, I recently applied for a position that listed a salary range of $60,000 to $70,000. After several rounds of interviews and a lot of time invested, I received an offer for $52,000. I was shocked and felt like my time had been wasted.     I understand that salary negotiations can be tricky, but it feels like companies are using these inflated salary ranges to attract candidates without any intention of actually paying that amount. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you navigate the job market when it feels like you're constantly being misled by salary postings?     I'm starting to feel disheartened and wonder if I should just focus on companies that are more transparent about their compensation. Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and I genuinely care for her. However, I've recently started feeling embarrassed about her in certain social situations.     To give you some context, she has a very quirky personality and tends to be a bit loud and eccentric, which I find endearing most of the time. But when we’re out with my friends or at family gatherings, I sometimes feel like she draws too much attention to herself in a way that makes me uncomfortable.     For example, she loves to tell funny stories, but sometimes they can be a bit over the top or inappropriate for the setting. I worry that my friends or family might judge her or think I’m not serious about our relationship because of her behavior.     I’ve tried to talk to her about it, but I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like she has to change who she is. I love her for her uniqueness, but I’m struggling with how to balance that with my own feelings of embarrassment.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do I approach this without damaging our relationship? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I've been playing Overwatch for a while now, and I can't help but notice some persistent issues that are really affecting the gameplay experience.     First off, the matchmaking system seems to be all over the place. I often find myself in games where the skill levels are drastically different, leading to one-sided matches that are not fun for anyone involved. It would be great if Blizzard could look into improving the matchmaking algorithm to create more balanced games.    Secondly, the bugs and glitches are becoming increasingly frustrating. From heroes not being able to use their abilities to visual glitches that make it hard to see what's happening in the game, these issues can really detract from the overall experience. I understand that no game is perfect, but it feels like these problems have been around for too long without a proper fix.    Lastly, I think the community would appreciate more communication from Blizzard regarding updates and changes. Knowing what the team is working on and what to expect in future patches would help keep the community engaged and hopeful for improvements.    I love this game and want to see it thrive, so I hope the developers can take these concerns into consideration. Thanks for reading!
__label__0 I'm curious about the general perception of people with ADHD in casual interactions, if there are any immediately obvious differences that neurotypicals may consciously/unconsciously pick up on. For those with partners with ADHD, I'm fully aware of the challenges ADHD brings to relationship, I'm talking more broadly about interactions with acquaintances/coworkers/friends, etc.
__label__1 I just discovered a small but incredibly time-saving change for taking screenshots on iOS! In the latest update, you can now quickly access the screenshot tool from the Control Center. Instead of having to press the side button and volume up button simultaneously, you can just swipe down from the top right corner of your screen and tap the screenshot icon.     This is especially useful when you need to take multiple screenshots in a row, as it saves you from fumbling with the buttons. Plus, you can easily edit or share the screenshot right after capturing it without having to navigate to your Photos app.     Has anyone else found this feature helpful? What other small changes have you noticed in iOS that make your life easier?
__label__1 I've been playing Mobile Legends for a while now, and I'm struggling to improve my gameplay. I often find myself getting outplayed in team fights and making mistakes that cost us the game.     I mainly play as a marksman, but I feel like I lack the positioning and decision-making skills needed to excel. Can anyone share some tips or strategies that have helped them improve? Also, are there any specific heroes you recommend for beginners in the marksman role?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 After rewatching the entire season of Only Murders in the Building, I’ve come up with a final theory about who the murderer might be, and I’m excited to share it with you all!    Throughout the season, we’ve seen a lot of red herrings and misdirection, but I believe the key lies in the relationships between the characters. My theory is that it’s actually Alice, the art dealer. Here’s why:    1. **Motive**: Alice has a strong motive to want to eliminate the victim. We know that she was involved in the art world and had a personal connection to the victim, which could have led to jealousy or a financial dispute.    2. **Opportunity**: She was present at the building during the time of the murder, and her alibi seems a bit too convenient. She often pops up at just the right moments, which makes me suspicious.    3. **Knowledge of the crime scene**: Alice has shown a keen interest in the details of the case, often asking questions that seem to probe deeper than a casual observer would. This could indicate that she knows more than she’s letting on.    4. **Connection to the other characters**: Her relationship with Mabel and the others gives her access to information that could help her cover her tracks. Plus, her artistic background could provide her with the skills to stage the scene in a way that misleads the investigation.    I know this theory might sound a bit out there, but I think it fits the clues we’ve been given throughout the season. I’m curious to hear what everyone else thinks! Do you think Alice could be the murderer, or do you have another suspect in mind? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 What if I farted really loud in a quiet room?      I was just thinking about how embarrassing it would be to let one rip during a serious meeting or a quiet class. I mean, everyone would turn to look at you, and you'd just want to disappear!      Have you ever experienced something like this? What happened? Did you laugh it off, or did you try to play it cool?      Also, what’s the most embarrassing fart story you have? Let’s hear those cringe-worthy moments!

__label__1 I've been playing Stadia for a while now, and I have to admit, I'm completely hooked. But not in the way Google probably envisioned.     I love the convenience of being able to play high-quality games on any device without the need for a powerful gaming rig. The ability to jump into a game on my laptop, then switch to my phone while I'm on the go, is a game-changer. However, my addiction isn't just about the games themselves; it's more about the community and the experiences I've had while playing.    I've found myself spending more time in the Stadia community forums, watching streams, and engaging with other players than actually playing the games. The discussions about game strategies, sharing tips, and even just chatting about our favorite titles have become a huge part of my daily routine.     I think what really keeps me coming back is the potential of Stadia. I see so much promise in the platform, and I can't help but get excited about what the future holds. The idea of cloud gaming is still relatively new, and I feel like we're just scratching the surface of what it can offer.     So, while I might not be addicted to the games in the traditional sense, I am definitely addicted to the community and the possibilities that Stadia brings. Anyone else feel the same way? What aspects of Stadia keep you coming back for more?
__label__0 Every time I've ever been in a serious relationship   ( 4 in the past 24 years with long gaps between them to heal and move on) i’ve put my whole heart into it.  I’ve loved my partners so fiercely and so strongly.  I’vealways done my best to help them, to show them how I care using multiple love languages to make sure they knew.  I’ve never been even the slightest bit unfaithful, I’ve always been there to offer encouragement and support when they needed it.  I’ve done every possible thing the way they tell you you should to show my past partners that they meant the world to me.  I’ve never wanted anything in return but their love too.    Why am I disposable?  Why does it not mean anything to them?  I know I’m not beautiful like some women are, but they chose me at the beginning, what changes that suddenly I’m not important to them or not enough for them?  I think I’m interesting at least?  I’m educated, I have a good job and I’m able to support myself just fine, I wouldn’t want or ever ask of anything from anyone and I never have.  I’m never dated anyone for money or looks, I truly care more about who they are inside.  I’m so exhausted with this.  What is the point of even trying to find someone to be with?  I’m going to die alone and I know it.  All I ever wanted is someone who will love me back the way I’ll love them.    Trying to love and be loved has been nothing but an endless stream of being kicked in the guts over and over again. It just feels like a crushing weight in my chest.

__label__0 Is it just me or is playing as a GK much harder this year than the past few years? I have 86 reactions and 91 diving, but sometimes my guy just doesn't make a move towards the ball. I haven't played as a GK since 20, but is anyone else having these issues?
__label__0 # Hey there,    I don't really have any knowledge of My Little Pony, so I hope that you can help me out? I also hope that this post is alright. :)    Thing is, when I was little, I was gifted a My Little Pony container. This was maybe 20 years ago. I have always loved this container so much and I have wondered if I could find similar My Little Pony containers in the same style. As I remember it, the container also contained a little bag of winegums.    I once found a picture with my container as well as two other containers that were similar, but I sadly lost the picture. After a long search on Google, I found one of the other containers.    This is the container that belongs to me (isn't it cute?!):    [https://imgur.com/a/ETcqLX2](https://imgur.com/a/ETcqLX2)    [https://imgur.com/bCv4idO](https://imgur.com/bCv4idO)    And this is the container that I found on Google. I do not own this picture:    [https://imgur.com/KFe05fA](https://imgur.com/KFe05fA)    &amp;#x200B;    My questions are:    \- Can you help me finding the third container? Maybe even more similar containers exist?    \- Where can I buy the containers that I don't already have? I have tried to look on Etsy and Ebay, but I -can't find anything! It seems impossible.    \- Maybe one of you guys are even willing to sell it to me?    &amp;#x200B;    Sorry for my rambling. Have a nice weekend :)
__label__1 I've been thinking about starting a mastermind group for entrepreneurs in my area, and I wanted to share some thoughts and gather feedback from this community.     For those who may not be familiar, a mastermind group is a peer-to-peer mentoring group where members share their challenges, successes, and insights to help each other grow both personally and professionally. The idea is to create a supportive environment where we can hold each other accountable and brainstorm solutions to our business problems.    Here’s what I envision for the group:  1. **Regular Meetings**: We would meet bi-weekly, either in person or virtually, to discuss our progress, set goals, and tackle any obstacles we’re facing.  2. **Diverse Backgrounds**: I want to include entrepreneurs from various industries to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. This diversity can spark creativity and innovation.  3. **Structured Agenda**: Each meeting would have a structured agenda to ensure we stay focused. We could allocate time for each member to present their current challenges and receive feedback from the group.  4. **Guest Speakers**: Occasionally, we could invite successful entrepreneurs or industry experts to share their insights and experiences, which could provide additional value to our discussions.  5. **Networking Opportunities**: Beyond the meetings, I hope to foster connections among members for potential collaborations, partnerships, or simply to expand our professional networks.    I believe that being part of a mastermind group can significantly accelerate our growth and help us navigate the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.     Has anyone here been part of a mastermind group? What was your experience like? Any tips on how to structure it effectively or common pitfalls to avoid? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 In Belgium, cyclists have several options for crossing streets safely, depending on the infrastructure and traffic regulations in place. Here are some common methods:    1. **Dedicated Bike Lanes**: Many cities have dedicated bike lanes that run parallel to the road. Cyclists can use these lanes to navigate through intersections and cross streets more safely. When approaching an intersection, cyclists should be aware of traffic signals and signs that apply to them.    2. **Traffic Lights**: At intersections with traffic lights, cyclists should follow the same signals as vehicles. In some areas, there are specific traffic lights for cyclists, which may be positioned lower for better visibility. Cyclists should wait for the green light before proceeding.    3. **Bike Crossings**: Some intersections have designated bike crossings, often marked with bike symbols on the road. These crossings may have their own traffic signals or be integrated with pedestrian crossings. Cyclists should yield to pedestrians when crossing at these points.    4. **Roundabouts**: In roundabouts, cyclists are generally expected to yield to traffic already in the roundabout. However, many roundabouts in Belgium have bike lanes that allow cyclists to navigate through them more safely. Cyclists should signal their intentions and be cautious of vehicles.    5. **Pedestrian Crossings**: In some cases, cyclists may choose to dismount and walk their bikes across pedestrian crossings. This is often recommended in busy areas where traffic is heavy, as it can be safer for both cyclists and pedestrians.    6. **Shared Spaces**: In some urban areas, streets are designed as shared spaces where cyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles coexist. In these areas, cyclists must be vigilant and yield to pedestrians while crossing streets.    Overall, the key for cyclists crossing streets in Belgium is to remain aware of their surroundings, follow traffic rules, and use designated paths and signals whenever possible. It's also important for drivers to be mindful of cyclists and give them the space they need to cross safely.
__label__1 Hey Vault Hunters!    I've been diving back into Borderlands 3 after spending a lot of time in the previous games, and I can't help but feel like the overall difficulty has been toned down a bit. I remember struggling with certain bosses and enemies in Borderlands 2, but in 3, I find myself breezing through most encounters, even on Mayhem mode.    Is it just me, or does it seem like the scaling and enemy mechanics are more forgiving this time around? I also noticed that the loot system feels a bit more generous, which is great, but I wonder if that contributes to the overall ease of the game.     What do you all think? Did you find Borderlands 3 easier compared to the previous titles? Any tips for ramping up the challenge if I’m looking for a tougher experience?     Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been using my Apple Watch for workouts, and I love how it tracks my progress. However, I find myself wanting to return to the watch face during my training sessions to quickly check the time or see my heart rate without having to swipe through multiple screens.     Is there a way to set it up so that I can easily return to the main watch face while still in a workout? I know I can press the Digital Crown, but sometimes it feels like it takes a bit longer than I’d like.     Also, are there any specific settings or shortcuts that you all use to make this process smoother? I’d love to hear your tips and tricks! Thanks!
__label__1 I’m writing this in hopes that the person who hit my dog in Clifton and didn’t stop might see it. On [insert date], my dog was in our yard when he was struck by a vehicle. I was devastated to find him injured and alone, and it breaks my heart to think that someone could just drive away without checking on him or reporting the incident.    My dog is a [insert breed or description], and he’s a beloved member of our family. Thankfully, he’s recovering, but the vet bills are piling up, and I can’t help but feel angry and hurt that someone could be so careless.     If you have any information about the incident or if you were the driver, I urge you to come forward. It’s not too late to do the right thing. I just want to understand what happened and ensure that this doesn’t happen to another pet in our community.     Thank you for reading, and please share this post to help spread the word.
__label__1 I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront for a while now, and I find myself torn between first and third person perspectives. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and I’m curious about what everyone else prefers.    In first person, I feel more immersed in the action. It’s like I’m actually in the cockpit of an X-Wing or wielding a lightsaber myself. The aiming feels more precise, especially when sniping or using blasters. However, I sometimes struggle with situational awareness since I can’t see my character’s body or surroundings as clearly.    On the other hand, third person gives me a better view of my surroundings and allows for more strategic movement. I can see my character’s animations and it feels more cinematic, especially during lightsaber duels. But I find aiming a bit trickier, especially at long distances.    So, what do you all prefer? Do you stick to one perspective, or do you switch it up depending on the situation? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been wondering if anyone knows whether we can still change the victory theme in Team Fortress 2. I remember back in the day, there were ways to customize the audio files to play different victory themes, but with all the updates and changes over the years, I'm not sure if that's still possible.     If anyone has tried it recently or knows the current status of this feature, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Also, if you have any tips or guides on how to do it, that would be awesome. Let's bring some fresh tunes to our victories!
__label__0 So, since starting hormones I've grown a noticeable chest (thanks progesterone!) and I am a little bit infamous in my circles for never wearing a bra. With that though, I often wear button ups and keep them mostly open. Specifically, you can almost always see the bottom crease and side of my boobs, and if I'm not careful my nipples can sometimes make an appearance too.     My best friend, also trans, had a more modest upbringing and she's happy that I feel comfortable baring so much of my chest, but she worries about how it reads to others. She's concerned that it veers too close to sexual when in public, especially if there are children here. Additionally, she feels that it reads as masculine to have so much of my chest exposed, comparing it to dudes who wear really deep v necks.     My friend truly takes no issue with my dress and will be the first to admit that she's got a tendency to be a prude, but I am genuinely curious, how does it read to have so much out there? I feel like it's no big deal but my friend disagrees, and even others have told me that it's not an issue, but it is noticeable in a way that I had no idea. I'm curious to get a trans perspective on this question.
__label__0 Sure the whole incest gag is getting overplayed, but it wasn't the base of many jokes and more of a McGuffin this episode.    For the rest, every set up is rewarded and every joke lands. You can feel the influence of the new writers but the presence of Dan Harmon is unmistakable in his talent for exploring tropes thoroughly and creatively.    The whole factory heist is pure gold with barely a moment of screen time wasted, especially Rick turning fortunes into monkeys paws. My one complaint would be that they spent a little too much time on the old dude.    Oh and Rick trying to Jack Sparrow himself into immortality only for Jerry to ruin it was the cherry on top. Just a 10/10 episode. Damn this season is going strong, guys!

I WON'T GIVE UP UNTIL I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS SO PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH AN ANSWER.
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I thought it would be fun to create a thread where we can share our experiences with cheaters in PUBG Mobile, but with a twist! Instead of just reporting them, let’s vent a little and share our frustrations.     Have you ever been in a match where you felt like you were doing great, only to be taken out by someone who clearly had an unfair advantage? Maybe you’ve encountered players with impossible aim, or those who seem to have unlimited health. It can be super frustrating, especially when you’ve put in the effort to improve your skills.     Feel free to share your stories, screenshots, or even just your thoughts on how cheaters impact the game. Let’s get it all out in the open! And remember, while it’s important to report cheaters, it’s also okay to express how it makes you feel.     Happy gaming, and may your next match be cheat-free! 💪🎮

__label__0 I went to high school with him. He was a violent no good prick from the start, always picking on the weaker kids and causing trouble for everyone. I have many stories I can tell you that involves him hurting others. When I heard he recently became a police officer it didn't surprise me one bit. It makes sense he'd want a job that would give him a chance to hurt people. I'm not surprised, but I am very concerned and terrified for anyone who will have to interact with him some day.
__label__1 I just finished reading Chapter 9 of "Second Life of a Trash Princess" and wow, the plot is really heating up! The character development is so well done, especially with our main character, who is slowly coming into her own after being reborn into this new world. I love how she’s starting to take charge of her destiny instead of just being a pawn in the game.    The art continues to be stunning, and the expressions really convey the emotions of the characters. I was particularly struck by the scene where she confronts her past mistakes; it felt so raw and real.     Also, can we talk about the supporting characters? They’re becoming more complex, and I’m really intrigued by the dynamics between them and the protagonist. I can’t wait to see how their relationships evolve in the upcoming chapters.    What did you all think of this chapter? Any predictions for what’s going to happen next? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 During law school I developed a system that allowed me to finish my first semester of 1L with straight A's in all my core classes at a T20 school. The system I developed does not require a superior intellect—in fact, I'm not particularly smart. (FWIW, I've literally only read like 7 books in my entire life, and I went to a state school for undergrad.)    I distilled this system down into a condensed class (approx. 4 hours long) that I taught to incoming 1L's (i.e., 0L's) last summer. The class was a massive success—You can read reviews from some of my past students if you search through old posts on here about the class and read their comments where they talk about their experience. Also, all of the information about *LAST YEAR's* class can be found in this downloadable PDF [here](https://pdfhost.io/v/.Vw1dFxBG_0L1L_Law_School_BOOTCAMPpdf.pdf).    Anyways, I've recently received several messages asking me if I'm going to teach the class again. At first, I honestly wasn't going to. While the feedback I received from all my students was unanimously positive, I became pretty drained from all the hate, bullshit, and trolling that I received from everyone else on Reddit (who did NOT take the class).    But then, last week I received the following text message (copied below) from a student I taught during his second semester of 1L. He went from straight B's to straight A's after learning my system in just a few hours. I then decided I'm going to teach the class again this year and, in fact, I'm going to invest some time into improving it and adding some extra stuff in that I left out last year. Trolls are gonna troll—fuck em. If you don't want to take the class, no one is making you.    I'll follow-up on here on a later date with more details, but I'll probably teach a few live courses in July and August and I'm also hoping to have a sweet digital streaming option ready by then as well. Stay tuned!    https://preview.redd.it/1vdyc6skfc491.jpg?width=2280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7fe191b4465b7b9f06ca35a29dcc3d75be500cc
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m in the early stages of launching my streetwear brand and I’m diving deep into the different types of T-shirt printing methods available. I want to make sure I choose the best option for my designs and budget. Here’s what I’ve found so far:    1. **Screen Printing**: This is one of the most popular methods for bulk orders. It produces vibrant colors and is great for simple designs. However, it can be costly for small runs due to setup fees.    2. **Direct-to-Garment (DTG)**: This method is like using a printer for fabric. It’s perfect for detailed designs and allows for a wide range of colors. The downside is that it can be slower and more expensive for larger quantities.    3. **Heat Transfer**: This involves printing a design onto a special paper and then using heat to transfer it onto the shirt. It’s versatile and good for small runs, but the prints may not be as durable as screen printing.    4. **Sublimation**: This is great for all-over prints and works best on polyester fabrics. The colors are vibrant and the print feels like part of the fabric. However, it’s not suitable for dark fabrics.    5. **Vinyl Cutting**: This method uses heat to apply vinyl to the shirt. It’s great for simple designs and can be very durable, but it’s not ideal for intricate graphics.    I’m leaning towards screen printing for my first collection due to its quality and durability, but I’m also considering DTG for some of my more detailed designs.     What methods have you all used, and what has been your experience? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I recently got a new jacket that I absolutely love, but I accidentally spilled something on it and now there's a noticeable stain. It's a light-colored fabric, so it's really standing out.     I was wondering if anyone has tips on how to effectively remove stains from jackets without damaging the fabric? I've heard mixed things about using water, soap, or even vinegar.     Also, if anyone has recommendations for specific products that work well for stain removal on jackets, I would really appreciate it! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I (17f) was adopted when i was 2 my parents have never tried to hide the fact and i’ve always known. however my mom would use that fact to fuel her narcissistic personality and manipulate me, when i was younger (6-11) if we got into an argument she’d throw me out on the front porch and toss an empty suitcase out there with me and tell me to go find my birth mom and see how much i like my life then. another time (13att) she took a frozen smoothie package out of the freezer and threw it at my head telling me i’m the reason she’s depressed. anyways today we got into an argument because she was saying how she didn’t like the spelling of a name for a new baby and i told her jokingly while laughing that sadly it wasn’t up to her but still a very pretty name and she immediately got all defensive saying “oh well i know that do you really think i’m that stupid i’m sharing my opinion i don’t need yours” i told her she was overreacting a bit and the next thing she says “fine then if your gonna keep being a bitch about everything to me i just won’t ever talk to you again” and at this point i’m annoyed so i told her that was perfectly fine by me (for context she’s never done anything parent like for me, i’ve been cooking, cleaning, doing my own laundry, finding ways to school and home bc it was an “inconvenience” for her, since i was 7) and she just scoffed and stormed away.  so aita for telling my mom it’s fine she never talks to me?

__label__1 I've been wrestling with the decision of whether to buy a PS5 now or wait for a potential Pro version to drop. I wanted to share my thoughts and see what others think.    First off, the PS5 is an incredible console. The graphics are stunning, the load times are lightning fast thanks to the SSD, and the DualSense controller is a game-changer with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. If you’re eager to dive into the latest games like "Horizon Forbidden West" or "Demon's Souls," the PS5 is definitely worth it.    However, I can’t help but wonder if waiting for a Pro version might be a smart move. Historically, Sony has released Pro versions of their consoles a few years after the initial launch, and they often come with enhanced performance, better graphics, and sometimes even exclusive features. If you’re someone who values having the best possible experience and can hold off for a bit, it might be worth waiting.    On the flip side, there’s no guarantee when or if a Pro version will be released. It could be a year or more before we see anything, and in the meantime, you’d be missing out on all the great games and experiences available on the current PS5. Plus, with the current supply chain issues, getting your hands on a PS5 can be a challenge, so if you find one, it might be wise to grab it.    Ultimately, it comes down to your gaming priorities. Are you itching to play the latest titles now, or are you willing to wait for potentially better hardware? I’d love to hear what others think! What are you planning to do?
__label__0 so... has anyone tried to decode what the music video means??    at the start, Brendon looks exhausted, tired, and worn out, then the manager pushes him to perform. after the second chorus, he explodes(??). he's then taken to the hospital and defibrillated. then it cuts to people dancing around a picture of Brendon (here's when I started to get confused), his funeral with everyone from current panic! around him and people from past videos, and he's pushing a piano up a ramp. the piano breaks and he picks up some pieces, montage of him and Maggie from past music videos, then he's pushing up the piano again. finally a burning picture of him before it cuts out.    I know there's a lot of symbolism (either that or I'm overthinking this) here so I would like to know what everyone thinks!    EDIT: I gave a quick little summary of what was happening in the music video just because lol
__label__1 I've been playing Lee Sin for a while now and I’m looking for some tips to improve my gameplay with him. I know he’s a high-skill champion with a lot of mobility and potential for outplays, but I often find myself struggling to make the most of his kit.     Here are a few specific areas where I could use some advice:    1. **Early Game Strategy**: What’s the best way to utilize Lee Sin in the early game? Should I focus on ganking lanes or farming?     2. **Skill Order**: What’s the optimal skill order for Lee Sin? I’ve seen different builds, and I’m not sure which one maximizes his potential.    3. **Combo Execution**: I often find myself fumbling my combos in team fights. What are some effective combos to practice that can help me secure kills or peel for my team?    4. **Ward Jumping**: I know Lee Sin can use wards to jump around, but I’m not very confident in my ward placement. Any tips on how to effectively use this mechanic in both offensive and defensive situations?    5. **Team Fight Positioning**: How should I position myself in team fights? I want to be able to engage effectively without getting blown up immediately.    Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I never thought I would be here, pouring my heart out to strangers on the internet, but here I am. My boyfriend left me, and I feel like my world has shattered into a million pieces. We had plans, dreams, and a future that seemed so bright. I remember the way he used to look at me, like I was the only person in the room, and now that gaze is gone, replaced by silence and emptiness.    It all happened so suddenly. One moment we were laughing together, and the next, he was telling me he needed space. I tried to understand, to give him what he wanted, but it felt like I was losing him with every passing day. I begged him to talk to me, to let me in, but he just pulled away further.     Now, I’m left with memories that haunt me. The way he used to hold my hand, the inside jokes we shared, the late-night talks that felt like they would never end. I replay those moments in my mind, wishing I could go back to when everything felt right.     I feel so lost without him. I keep checking my phone, hoping for a message that will never come. I miss him so much it hurts, and I don’t know how to move on. I just want to scream, to cry, to let it all out, but I feel so alone in this pain.     How do you heal from something like this? How do you pick up the pieces when your heart feels so heavy? I just want to feel whole again.

__label__1 I've recently been experimenting with the E&B Superfine 18/20g coffee grounds for my espresso shots, and I wanted to share my experience and hear from others who have tried it.    First off, the grind size is incredibly fine, which I found to be perfect for pulling rich, flavorful shots. I typically use a double basket, and the 18g dose has been yielding a nice balance of sweetness and acidity. The crema is thick and velvety, which is always a plus in my book!    I’ve noticed that the extraction time is crucial with this grind. If I go too fast, the shot tends to be under-extracted and sour, but if I slow it down just a bit, I get a beautifully balanced shot with deep flavors. I’ve been playing around with the temperature settings on my machine as well, and I find that a slightly higher temperature brings out more of the chocolatey notes in the coffee.    For those who have used E&B Superfine, what are your thoughts? Any tips on dosing or extraction times? I’m eager to hear how others are using this grind and what flavors you’re getting out of it!
__label__1 I'm a 25-year-old male who has always struggled with being underweight. I’ve tried various diets and workout routines, but I still find it hard to gain weight. I currently weigh around 140 pounds and I’m 6 feet tall. I want to reach a healthier weight, ideally around 160-170 pounds.    Here are some things I’ve tried so far:  - Eating more frequently: I’ve been trying to eat 5-6 meals a day instead of the usual 3.  - Focusing on calorie-dense foods: I’ve incorporated more nuts, avocados, and whole grains into my diet.  - Strength training: I’ve started lifting weights a few times a week to build muscle mass.    Despite these efforts, I’m still not seeing the results I want. I often feel full quickly, and I’m not sure how to increase my calorie intake without feeling uncomfortable.     I would love to learn more about effective strategies for gaining weight in a healthy way. Any advice on meal planning, specific foods to include, or workout routines that could help me build muscle would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__1 I’m feeling really overwhelmed and confused about my relationship with my dad, and I’m hoping to get some perspective or advice from this community.     To give you some background, my dad has always been a bit of a difficult person. He has a short temper, and he often makes hurtful comments that leave me feeling inadequate. Recently, things have escalated. He’s been more critical than ever, and it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough for him.     For example, I recently graduated from college, and instead of celebrating my achievement, he focused on the fact that I didn’t get a job in my field right away. He made comments about how I’m wasting my degree and how disappointed he is in me. It really stung because I’ve been trying my best, and I thought he would be proud of me.     On top of that, he has a tendency to dismiss my feelings. Whenever I try to talk to him about how his words affect me, he brushes it off and tells me I’m being too sensitive. It’s frustrating because I feel like I can’t express myself without being invalidated.     I’ve tried to set boundaries, but he doesn’t seem to respect them. For instance, I told him I needed some space to figure things out after graduation, but he keeps calling and texting, insisting that I need to talk to him. I feel trapped between wanting to maintain a relationship with him and needing to protect my own mental health.     I’m at a point where I’m not sure how to move forward. Should I continue to try to communicate with him, or is it time to take a step back? I really want a healthy relationship with my dad, but I don’t know how to get there when everything feels so wrong. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I recently went through a symbolic act that I never thought would bring me so much relief. For years, I’ve been dealing with the emotional turmoil caused by my narcissistic mother. Growing up, it felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying to please her while she belittled me and made everything about her. The emotional manipulation, the guilt trips, and the constant need for validation from her were exhausting.    After years of therapy and self-reflection, I finally reached a point where I realized that I needed to let go of the hold she had on my life. I decided to do something symbolic to represent this release. I wrote a letter to her, detailing all the pain she caused me, the memories I wanted to bury, and the ways I was reclaiming my life. I poured my heart into it, expressing everything I had kept bottled up for so long.    Then, I took that letter to a quiet spot in the woods, a place where I felt safe and at peace. I dug a small hole and placed the letter inside, covering it with dirt as I said a few words about letting go of the past and the hurt she caused me. It felt cathartic to physically bury the pain and the memories that had haunted me for so long.    Afterward, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over me. It was as if I had finally severed the invisible ties that had bound me to her. I realized that I no longer needed her approval or validation to be happy. I am reclaiming my life, my happiness, and my identity.     I know this is just the beginning of a long journey, but I feel empowered and ready to move forward. I wanted to share this experience in hopes that it might inspire others who are dealing with similar situations. Sometimes, taking a symbolic step can help us find the closure we need to heal.
__label__1 I've been dealing with a friend who often forgets to text me back, and it's starting to get frustrating. I understand that people can be busy or forgetful, but it feels like I'm always the one reaching out and not getting much in return.     At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe they just have a lot going on. But after a while, it started to feel one-sided, and I began to question if they really value our friendship.     I want to address this without coming off as needy or confrontational. I was thinking of bringing it up casually the next time we talk. Something like, "Hey, I noticed that sometimes it takes a while for you to respond to my texts. Is everything okay?" This way, I can gauge if there's a reason behind it or if it's just a habit they have.     I also considered setting some boundaries for myself. If they don't respond after a certain amount of time, I might just stop reaching out for a bit. I don't want to feel like I'm chasing after someone who isn't as invested in the friendship as I am.     Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach the conversation or manage my expectations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I've tried a few cars (rsr, lancer Evo x, and the range Rover sport SVR 15')  with little success often ending at 230-255yds . What should I do, I'm nearing the end of the grind for the 488 pista and this is really a roadblock. I'm only level 35 so I'm working with elite and super parts. Should I go get my rep up or do high heat races? Any answers are appreciated thanks.
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m looking for some recommendations for anime that really dive deep into character development and emotional storytelling. I’ve recently finished watching *Your Lie in April* and *A Silent Voice*, and I was blown away by how they portrayed the struggles and growth of the characters.     I’d love to hear your suggestions for similar shows or movies that have that same kind of emotional impact. Bonus points if they have a good soundtrack!     Thanks in advance! :D
__label__1 Conspiracy theories have indeed been a persistent issue throughout history, often leading to significant harm to individuals and societies. The potential for conspiracy theories to incite violence, foster discrimination, or undermine public trust in institutions has been recognized across various historical contexts.    One of the earliest examples can be traced back to the Middle Ages, particularly during the Black Death in the 14th century. Jews were scapegoated and accused of poisoning wells, leading to widespread violence and massacres against Jewish communities. In response, some local authorities attempted to quell these rumors through public proclamations and by providing evidence to counter the accusations, although these efforts were often too little, too late.    In the 20th century, the rise of totalitarian regimes showcased how conspiracy theories could be weaponized for political gain. For instance, the Nazis propagated the conspiracy theory that Jews were responsible for Germany's economic woes and societal problems, which justified horrific acts of violence and genocide. To combat such dangerous ideologies, various methods were employed, including education campaigns aimed at promoting tolerance and understanding, as well as legal measures to punish hate speech and incitement to violence.    The Cold War era also saw the proliferation of conspiracy theories, particularly regarding communism and espionage. Governments, especially in the United States, engaged in counter-propaganda efforts to debunk myths about communist infiltration and to reassure the public about national security. This included the use of media, public speeches, and educational programs to promote a more accurate understanding of political realities.    In more recent times, the internet has transformed the landscape of conspiracy theories, allowing them to spread rapidly and widely. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, saw a surge in conspiracy theories regarding the virus's origins and the efficacy of vaccines. In response, social media platforms have implemented measures to limit the spread of misinformation, including fact-checking, labeling false claims, and removing content that violates community guidelines. Governments and health organizations have also launched public health campaigns to educate the public about the science behind the pandemic and to counteract harmful misinformation.    Overall, while conspiracy theories have been a recurring issue throughout history, the methods to combat them have evolved. From public proclamations and educational campaigns to modern digital strategies, the fight against harmful conspiracy theories continues to be a critical challenge for societies worldwide.
__label__1 I’ve been reflecting a lot on my journey since leaving the church, and I can’t help but think about how much I’ve learned from my experiences, both good and bad. When I was in the church, I was taught to avoid anything that could be seen as dangerous or risky. The idea was to live a life that was safe and secure, following the rules and guidelines laid out for us. But now, I see that life is inherently full of risks and challenges, and that’s what makes it meaningful.    After resigning, I faced a lot of backlash from family and friends. It was painful to lose those relationships, but it also forced me to confront my fears and insecurities. I learned that it’s okay to fail and to stumble along the way. Each setback has taught me something valuable about myself and what I truly want in life.     I’ve discovered that embracing the unknown can lead to incredible growth. I’ve taken risks in my career, explored new hobbies, and even made new friends who share my values. It’s not always easy, and there are days when I feel overwhelmed, but I know that every challenge is an opportunity to rise stronger.     So, to anyone who feels stuck or afraid to step outside their comfort zone, I encourage you to take that leap. Life is messy and unpredictable, but it’s also beautiful and full of potential. Let’s embrace the journey, learn from our failures, and support each other as we navigate this new path.

__label__1 Extraterrestrial life is often considered a conspiracy theory for several reasons. First, there is a significant lack of concrete evidence that definitively proves the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. While there have been numerous claims of UFO sightings and encounters, many of these have been debunked or remain unverified, leading skeptics to categorize them as conspiracy theories rather than scientific facts.    Second, the idea of extraterrestrial life often intersects with government secrecy and cover-ups. Many conspiracy theories suggest that governments, particularly the U.S. government, are hiding information about alien encounters or technology. This secrecy fuels speculation and distrust, leading people to believe that there is more to the story than what is publicly known.    Additionally, the portrayal of aliens in popular culture—movies, TV shows, and books—often sensationalizes the concept, making it seem more like fiction than a scientific possibility. This can contribute to the perception that discussions about extraterrestrial life are more about entertainment or conspiracy than legitimate scientific inquiry.    Finally, the scientific community is cautious about claims of extraterrestrial life. While there are ongoing efforts to search for signs of life on other planets (like Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn), the scientific method requires rigorous evidence and peer review, which can take time. This cautious approach can be misinterpreted by some as a dismissal of the possibility of extraterrestrial life, further fueling conspiracy theories.    In summary, the combination of a lack of definitive evidence, government secrecy, cultural portrayals, and scientific caution contributes to the perception of extraterrestrial life as a conspiracy theory.

__label__1 ...does the Steam Deck feel like a game-changer for handheld gaming? I recently got mine, and I can't help but feel that it’s not just a portable console but a full-fledged gaming PC in my hands. The ability to play AAA titles on the go is something I never thought would be possible.     I’ve been diving into some of my favorite games, and the performance has been surprisingly solid. I’ve even managed to tweak some settings to get better frame rates without sacrificing too much visual quality.     But I’m curious, is it just me, or do you all feel the same excitement?

__label__1 In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), the concept of a deft-native prime broker like MarginFi is gaining traction. But who exactly are the users of such a platform, and what needs does it fulfill?    1. **Retail Traders**: Individual traders looking for a seamless way to access margin trading without the complexities of traditional finance. They benefit from the ability to leverage their positions, access a variety of assets, and trade with lower fees compared to centralized exchanges.    2. **Institutional Investors**: Hedge funds, family offices, and other institutional players are increasingly looking to enter the DeFi space. A prime broker like MarginFi can provide them with the necessary tools to manage large trades, access liquidity, and utilize advanced trading strategies while maintaining compliance and risk management protocols.    3. **Liquidity Providers**: Users who provide liquidity to the platform can earn fees and rewards. They are essential for the functioning of the prime broker, as they help ensure that there is enough liquidity for margin trading and other financial products offered.    4. **Developers and Protocols**: Other DeFi projects and developers may use MarginFi’s infrastructure to build their own products or integrate margin trading capabilities into their platforms. This can lead to a more interconnected DeFi ecosystem.    5. **Arbitrageurs**: Traders who seek to exploit price discrepancies across different markets can use MarginFi to execute trades quickly and efficiently, leveraging the platform's capabilities to maximize their profits.    6. **Risk Managers**: Users focused on managing risk in their portfolios can utilize the advanced analytics and risk assessment tools that a prime broker offers, allowing them to make informed decisions about their trading strategies.

__label__1 I’m in a 10-team PPR league and I’m considering a trade that involves my team and another manager. Here’s the breakdown:    **My Side:**    - DeAndre Hopkins (WR)    - David Montgomery (RB)      **Their Side:**    - Tyreek Hill (WR)    - Kenneth Gainwell (RB)      I’m currently sitting at 4-3 and looking to bolster my WR corps. I feel like Hill has a higher ceiling than Hopkins, especially with the way the Dolphins' offense has been performing. Montgomery has been solid, but I’m not sure if Gainwell can provide enough value in return.     What do you all think? Who wins this trade? Should I go for it or hold onto my players? Any advice would be appreciated!

__label__1 I’ve been thinking about the inclusion of Super Mario Bros. and The Lost Levels in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) version of Super Mario All-Stars. It’s interesting to see how Nintendo decided to bring these classic games to a new platform, even though they were already available on the NES.    One reason could be to introduce these iconic titles to a new generation of gamers who may not have experienced them on the NES. The graphics and sound were significantly improved in the All-Stars version, making the games feel fresh and more appealing to players who were used to the enhanced capabilities of the SNES.    Additionally, The Lost Levels was originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2, and it was never officially released in North America until the All-Stars collection. This gave players a chance to experience the original sequel that was deemed too difficult for Western audiences at the time.    Including both games in the All-Stars package also provided a sense of nostalgia for older players while offering new content for younger fans. It’s a great way to celebrate the legacy of Mario and keep the franchise alive across different generations. What do you all think? Did you enjoy playing these classic games on the SNES, or do you prefer the original NES versions?

__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about my future and whether or not I want to have kids, and honestly, my ADHD makes me feel like I should never even consider it.     I struggle with executive dysfunction, and the thought of managing a household and a child feels overwhelming. I can barely keep my own life organized, let alone someone else's. The idea of forgetting to feed a child or missing important appointments terrifies me. I often feel like I’m just barely keeping my head above water with my own responsibilities, and the thought of adding another human being to the mix feels like a recipe for disaster.    I also worry about my emotional regulation. I have days where I feel so overwhelmed that I can’t even function, and I can’t imagine how that would affect a child. I don’t want to pass on my struggles to them or create an environment where they feel anxious or neglected because I’m having a tough day.     On top of that, I have this constant fear of judgment. I see other parents who seem to have it all together, and I can’t help but think that I would never measure up. I know that parenting is hard for everyone, but I feel like my ADHD would make it even harder.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you reconcile your ADHD with the idea of parenting? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.
__label__1 I've been playing Warzone on PC for a while now, and I’ve noticed that the game takes up a massive amount of space on my hard drive. With all the updates and new content, it feels like it just keeps growing! I’m running low on storage and I’m wondering if there are any ways to reduce the game’s size without sacrificing too much content or performance.

Has anyone successfully reduced the size of Warzone on their PC? What steps did you take? Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’m having a bit of a strange issue with my WireGuard setup on my macOS client. I’ve been using WireGuard for a while now, and it has been working great, but recently I’ve noticed that after connecting to my VPN, the Endpoint IP seems to switch between different past configurations shortly after establishing the connection.    Here’s a bit of context:  - I have multiple configurations saved for different servers, and I switch between them depending on my needs.  - When I connect to a specific configuration, I can see that the Endpoint IP is correct initially, but then it changes to an IP from a previous configuration after a few seconds.  - This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes it happens, and sometimes it doesn’t.    Here’s a snippet of my WireGuard configuration for reference:    ```  [Interface]  PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY  Address = 10.0.0.2/24  DNS = 1.1.1.1    [Peer]  PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY  Endpoint = server.example.com:51820  AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0  PersistentKeepalive = 25  ```    I’ve checked the following:  1. **Configuration Files**: I’ve ensured that there are no duplicate entries or misconfigurations in my WireGuard configuration files.  2. **Network Settings**: I’ve looked into my macOS network settings to see if there’s anything unusual, but everything seems normal.  3. **Logs**: I’ve checked the WireGuard logs, but they don’t seem to indicate any errors or issues when the IP switches.    Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a way to prevent the Endpoint IP from switching to a previous configuration? I’m worried that this might lead to potential security issues or connectivity problems.    Thanks in advance for any help or insights you can provide!
__label__0 Hello Everyone, So I have a System with a GTX 1060 running my 2 Main Displays and a GTX 1080 running my gaming monitor. However today my GTX 1060 starting throwing out a TDR Failure ... At first it was just a screen freeze , than second crash all white screen , third crash was Purple and Yellow all over with lines and stuff. Now my PC won't boot and just shows a flashing underscore on the main monitor. GTX 1080 monitor never showed any of these signs just the 1060.    Well I know this card is dead no doubt but why is it flashing a white underscore for and nothing else ? Could it be possible that the 750w Power supply can't feed both Cards ? (I only use one at a time and I was doing college work)     I really wanna save this 1060 :(
__label__0 I’m in this between a rock and a hard place situation. I’ve been doing 4ams since 2020 under inbound/general merch/unload. When I started back in 2015 that’s what I was too. And then a couple years later they made it 6am so we can “be on the floor with guests more”. So I have some experience with both. Well I just got some news that again we are switching back to 6am. However my TL told me if I wanted to, I could stay on at 4am.    I am so conflicted over this. I’m a very indecisive person and although I know in the end this is my decision to make, I like hearing other peoples opinions to get different perspectives.    My pros for 4am:     1. Half of my shift I don’t have to deal with guests. This was a huge plus for me when I started. I was extremely introverted and shy and would do anything (like getting up at 3am) to limit having to deal with people. However…after 7 years doing this, I don’t really care. It’s less about avoiding people, and more I can get more work done uninterrupted. I find most morning guests to be pretty chill.     2. At the latest I get out at 12:30.     3. I get an extra $20 a week just from those 4 hours I work before 8am.    My cons of 4am:    1. Getting up at 3am. Even after a couple years of this, I can’t just peacefully wake up at 3. I just get jolted from my dreams by my alarm clock. I think it’s burning me out physically and mentally. And when I have a day off it just makes it harder to go back to it the next day. I can wake up at 5am fine but I’m not forcing myself up at 3 for no reason.     2. The rest of the day is a slog. While I do have the rest of my day to myself, it’s like I’m at 75% and it just drops faster than my phone battery as the day goes on. I get headaches and feel irritable. If I take a nap I just feel groggy and not refreshed at all.    3. Having the bedtime of a child. This has caused a bit of conflict in past relationships I’ve had since most other people do regular 9-5 and stay up till 11 or 12. I try to be in bed by 8 but if I have a date or something I’ll try to push it to 10.  When I started this didn’t matter as much because I was this quiet shut in but over time I’ve become a little more outgoing.    Pros of 6am:    1. Waking up at 5am. This is like sleeping in to me. I can do this on my days off too no problem. My mental health might improve a bit too.    2. If I can ever move out it would give me more wiggle room to my commute.     3. I can stay out later. My work schedule aligns a bit closer to most other people.    Cons of 6am:    1. I know it’s stupid but 6-2:30 just seems so long. I know it’s the same as 4-12:30 but idk in my head it just seems shorter. Idfk    2. Less daylight to myself. I Lowkey wish they did this toward the beginning of summer. Now fall is coming and it’ll be dark by 5:30. That kinda bums me out. Tho this could be the kick I need to be more productive    Honestly after typing this out and seeing my thoughts, I’m leaning more toward 6am. But yea.

__label__1 When it comes to protein intake, it really depends on your individual goals, activity level, and body weight. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine how much protein you should be consuming:    1. **General Recommendations**: For the average adult, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This means if you weigh 70 kg (about 154 lbs), you should aim for around 56 grams of protein per day.    2. **For Active Individuals**: If you’re regularly working out or trying to build muscle, you might want to increase your protein intake. Many fitness experts recommend between 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, depending on the intensity of your workouts. For example, if you’re a serious athlete, you might aim for the higher end of that range.    3. **For Weight Loss**: If you’re trying to lose weight, increasing your protein intake can help you feel fuller for longer and preserve muscle mass while losing fat. Aiming for around 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight can be beneficial.    4. **Protein Sources**: Make sure to include a variety of protein sources in your diet. This can include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, focus on plant-based proteins like lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, and tofu.    5. **Listen to Your Body**: Ultimately, it’s important to listen to your body and adjust your protein intake based on how you feel and your performance in the gym. If you’re feeling fatigued or not recovering well, you might need to reassess your protein consumption.    Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and goals. Happy lifting!

__label__0 I just thought I would share this in case it might help someone else.     My pmdd has gotten so severe the last year (depression, suicidal ideation, rage, etc. about a week before my period) and I’ve tried everything and nothing has helped. But this month I managed to have barely any symptoms, just a bit weepy some days, I’ll take that over laying bed depressed for a week! I’m cautiously optimistic because my pmdd was getting unbearable, so I thought I would share what I did differently this month in case it can provide some relief to anyone else.    - the main thing is red raspberry leaf tea. I drink it every night and really think this is the main game changer. I’m using the Yogi brand, you can find it at Walmart.     -probiotics and yogurt. This sounds weird but there’s a lot of research on receptors in the brain being linked to your stomach, and I definitely notice I have upset stomachs a lot during my hell week. I eat a yogurt everyday for the good bacteria and add seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, flax).     -cutting out dairy, less meat and eggs. You might be confused from the one above but I eat almond milk yogurt, they have all different kinds (oat, soy, etc.). Lara Briden talks about this, I guess it’s something to do with the hormones in lactating cows. I also cut down on my meat/egg consumption a lot, but no completely, since they often use artificial hormones to promote growth and production.     I know everyone’s different and just because it helped me doesn’t mean it will help you, but finding any relief is amazing.     For context, I’ve tried birth control, antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, supplements, lifestyle changes (exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc.)antihistamines, progesterone cream and nothing has worked, my pmdd kept getting worse, so currently the above is the only things I’m doing for relief.     I was considering surgery. Still might if this relief doesn’t last, I’ll post an update in a few months.

__label__1 I've been trying to enjoy Monopoly Plus on my PS4, but it has become completely unplayable for me. Every time I try to start a game, it either crashes or freezes during the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the game, clearing the cache, and even resetting my console, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? I really want to play with my friends, but it's so frustrating when the game won't even load. Any tips or solutions would be greatly appreciated!     Also, if anyone has found a workaround or a different game that captures the same fun of Monopoly, I’d love to hear your suggestions!
__label__0 How can I save/backup my current windows configuration so everytime I need to do a clean Install I get the same settings and application downloaded and installed?
__label__0 Ok, so let me start this with... Im trying to "stick my dick in crazy"     Long story short, im hitting up this girl that one of my friends used to have sex with. He told me that after the third or fourth time having sex with her, he started peeing blood and it was because she "cheated" on him with some other dude (they weren't in a relationship).    Basically what im asking is... Is it safe to eat her pussy? Or should i avoid that?    If theres a risk... Is there like a way to identify if she like, has a disease going on down there? Like herpes is easy to identify. But what about other stuff? Or is smell my only option here?      Why do you want to eat her pussy if you dont know her?:      I fucking love eating pussy, even though ive only done it on two women. My ex, wow, amazing. My mouth waters thinking back to it. And a bridesmaid at my best friend's wedding.    Why werent you worried about her?:     Long story short, I was a groomsman, she was my partner. We were partnered together specifically to hook up and hopefully become a couple and get married ( long story short it didn't exactly work out) so i knew she was 100% clean and she knew i was 100% clean. Which is why i didn't think twice about going down on her the night of the wedding. Ate her out forwards and backwards.     Advice?
__label__0 With the Obliterate buff now making it allow up to 25% extra damage, I made a build for this talent that I've thoroughly enjoyed. It's been some of the most I've had in this game for a while.    Weapons:     Vector SBR 9mm (the black one with a thin stock) with Future Perfect, DtooC for the attribute. MP7 with In Sync, Stability for attribute (DtA or DtooC would be better but this one had low CHC so I recaled that to max it out). M9 with Finisher (Said it once, I'll say it a million times: best pistol talent). All have CHD mods.    Gear:    Sokolov for Mask, Backpack, and Chest. Ceska for Gloves. Grupo for Holster. Fox's Prayer for Kneepads. All Red cores except one Blue. Some CHC rolls, CHD on all or most pieces, then the rest are kind your choice. My CHC sits at around 55% and I have about 23% Weapon Handling which I find works well enough. Armor Regen could be useful or Repair Skills if you're using a repair drone. Chest has Obliterate and Backpack has Vigilance.    Skills:    Drone, either Defender or Fixer. Defender can help keep Vigilance going, but Fixer provides heals. Up to you. Also, Crusader shield. Works great with either weapon. Future Perfect gives your shield more health and extra damage boosts while In Sync can give great weapon damage boosts if you whip the shield in and out.     SMG's innately high CHC work amazingly with Obliterate. With high fire rate SMGs, you can reach the cap on the talent very easily. Vigilance isn't required, but it's great having a bunch of extra damage.     Push up to enemies and tear them apart. Most Heroic elites go down in one mag and some change, BT Tanks take maybe three mags but it's easy to break their ammo chain and get them distracted.    I highly recommend giving this build a try if you have the gear for it and I welcome constructive criticism on the build. Happy hunting!
__label__0 Hi everyone, I’ve been assigned a project where I basically have to predict the the number of moves that certain matches at the upcoming candidates tournament will take (with 0 chess knowledge, mind you). I’m thinking of using all of the attendees’ match histories vs other high ranked opponents to make a model, but I’m wondering if this dataset will be representative of matches at the candidates tournament. Would different tournaments/scenarios lead professionals to play differently, skewing the average length in a certain direction, or would all games between 2 high-rated professionals be more or less the same despite the circumstances of the game?    Any other info that seems crucial but wouldn’t be known to a non-chess follower would also be appreciated. Thanks!

__label__1 I wanted to share something that’s been weighing on my mind lately. A few weeks ago, I had a vivid dream about my dad. In the dream, he was driving his car and suddenly lost control, crashing into a tree. It felt so real, and I woke up feeling anxious and unsettled. I brushed it off as just a bad dream, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it meant something.    Fast forward to last week, my dad called me in a panic. He had been in a car accident, and thankfully he was okay, but his car was pretty banged up. When he described the accident, it was eerily similar to what I had seen in my dream. I felt a chill run down my spine.    I’ve always had a bit of intuition, but I’ve never experienced something like this before. It’s made me wonder if I somehow tapped into a warning or a premonition. Has anyone else had experiences like this? How do you interpret these kinds of dreams? I’m still trying to process everything and would love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences.

__label__0 Homebrew is a preference but modules work too as Ian is learning! Please private message me (Eryn) to talk. We can be semi-flexible with the time/day but Saturday, Thursday, and anytime after 7pm start time will not work.          \--Hey I'm Eryn (22F, she/her), I've been playing dnd for about 3 years as both a player and DM. I mostly enjoy druids and what I really enjoy the most out of dnd is building meaningful connections between the players through roleplay. Outside of dnd, I'm a college student studying geology and I play a lot of PC games like destiny 2. Also, I have 3 of my friends looking to join the group with me; I've included their descriptions below.    &amp;#x200B;    \--It’s always hard to describe yourself. I'm Dalton, I’m 28 (he/him), and I’ve also been playing for a similar amount of time as Eryn. I enjoy the spontaneity of the game and value levity, as well as drama. I also appreciate a finely-tuned combat encounter, but a wild mess can be just as fun, at times. I’m an amateur streamer outside of dnd and my schedule should be somewhat flexible.    &amp;#x200B;    \--My name is Xavier and I am 20 years old. I have been playing D&amp;D online for around five years now. I love playing wizards.    &amp;#x200B;    \--Hi, my name is Ian 28M, I've never officially played DnD either as a player or a DM. Most I've done is sat in on a few sessions with past friends groups and watched/ listened. From the research and navigating classes from help from my partner in most interested in a Fighter-Samurai. What I think I'll enjoy in DnD is the little moments that are filled with laughter and confusion when random things happen that no one could've predicted. Outside of DnD I work on a flightline, helping coordinate maintenance with others to keep aircraft updated and fly worthy. I play allot of PC games like D2, rocket league, escape from tarkov and many others.

__label__1 I'm considering purchasing a 1997 BMW E39 540i with 160,000 km for $5,800 CAD. I've always had a soft spot for the E39 series, and I've heard great things about the driving experience and build quality. However, I'm also aware that older BMWs can come with their own set of issues, especially when it comes to maintenance and reliability.    I wanted to get some feedback from the community on whether this price is reasonable for the condition and mileage of the car. What should I be looking for in terms of common problems with this model?     Additionally, how does the maintenance cost typically compare to other vehicles of similar age? I plan to use it as a daily driver, so I want to ensure that it won't be a money pit. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been dating someone for a few months now, and I can't shake this feeling that something is off. We have a lot of fun together, and I genuinely enjoy their company, but I often find myself overthinking our relationship. I worry about whether I'm good enough for them, if they really like me, or if I'm just imagining things.     Sometimes, I catch myself analyzing every little thing they say or do, trying to decipher their feelings. For example, if they take a while to respond to a text, I start to panic and think maybe they’re losing interest. I know this isn't healthy, but I can't help it.     I’ve talked to a few friends about it, and they say it’s normal to have doubts, but I feel like I might be taking it too far. I don’t want to ruin what we have by overthinking everything.     Is there something wrong with me for feeling this way? How can I manage these thoughts and focus on enjoying the relationship instead of worrying about it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I recently made the jump into dirt racing on iRacing, and I have to say, it’s a whole new world compared to the asphalt tracks I’m used to. I’m having a blast, but I could definitely use some tips to improve my skills and performance.     Here are a few things I’ve been trying to figure out:    1. **Throttle Control**: I’ve noticed that it’s super easy to spin out if I’m too aggressive on the throttle. What are some good techniques for managing throttle input, especially in the corners?    2. **Drifting vs. Cornering**: I’ve seen some drivers drift through the corners while others seem to hug the inside line. When should I be trying to drift, and when should I focus on a tighter line?    3. **Setup Adjustments**: I’m still learning about car setups. What are some basic adjustments I can make to help with handling? I’ve heard things like adjusting the stagger and tire pressure can make a big difference.    4. **Practice Races**: Are there specific tracks or series that are better for beginners? I want to get as much practice as possible without getting too overwhelmed.    5. **Community Resources**: Any recommendations for YouTube channels, Twitch streams, or Discord servers that focus on dirt racing? I’d love to learn from more experienced drivers.    Thanks in advance for any advice you can share! I’m excited to keep improving and hopefully see you all on the track soon!     *Keep it sideways!*

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m having a bit of trouble with the iSpawner mod in Vault Hunters. I’ve set up my spawners, but I can’t seem to interact with them at all. I’ve tried right-clicking, shift-right-clicking, and even breaking and replacing them, but nothing seems to work.     I’ve checked the permissions and it looks like I should have access to use them.

__label__0 I don't have a lot of hours in CK3 and from my perspective anything besides light cav is sub optimal with a situational exception of heavy cav, for when you have stacked enough buffs.     If you focus every county you have on buffing light cavalry they will outdamage any other default MAA, AND will make it so that every battle you fight is a stack wipe, because of insane pursuit.     So am I missing something that other MAA can provide, or light cav are just so meta?

__label__0 Hi there! I've had my PC for more than a year now and I can't pinpoint when exactly but at one point I suddenly started having kernel power 41 (63) issues that would cause my computer to restart. It doesn't happen all the time but it's frequent enough to be real annoying (and concerning). It usually happens when I leave my PC on idle (hence why I usually leave a twitch stream running if I have to step out so it doesn't idle).    I already turned off fast start up but the problem still persists. This time I had my browser open and a Netflix video paused. I also have a new UPS with more than enough VA/Watts to handle my load so I assume it's not a power issue. Thanks to anyone who can help!    EDIT: I also already turned off automatic restart long ago...however it still restarts whenever it crashes    EDIT2: the keyword in event viewer is 0x8000400000000002
__label__1 Poland is really on a different level right now! From the crazy political moves to the wild cultural shifts, it feels like every day there's something new happening. Just the other day, I saw a video of a Polish street performer doing some insane tricks that had me shook!

Whether it's the vibrant nightlife in Warsaw or the stunning landscapes in the countryside, there's so much to explore. Anyone else feeling the vibes from Poland?

__label__1 I've been experimenting with LSD for a while now, and I've learned a few tricks about how to store it safely and discreetly. Here are some of my favorite places to hide it:    1. **Inside a Book**: This is a classic. Just find a book that you don’t read often, and tuck the LSD inside the pages. It’s a great way to keep it hidden in plain sight.    2. **In a Pill Bottle**: If you have any empty pill bottles lying around, they can be perfect for storing LSD. Just make sure to label it something mundane like "Vitamins" or "Allergy Meds" to avoid any suspicion.    3. **Under a Loose Floorboard**: If you have access to a place in your home with wooden floors, you can lift a loose board and stash it there. Just be careful to remember where you put it!    4. **In a Fake Plant**: If you have any fake plants in your home, you can hide it in the soil or even inside the pot. It’s a clever way to keep it out of sight.    5. **In a Box of Tea Bags**: This one is a bit unconventional, but if you have a box of tea bags, you can slip the LSD in there. Just make sure to put it in a baggie to keep it safe from moisture.    6. **Behind a Picture Frame**: If you have a picture frame hanging on the wall, you can slide the LSD behind it. It’s a discreet spot that’s easy to access when you need it.    7. **In a Makeup Bag**: If you or someone in your household uses makeup, hiding it in a makeup bag can be a good option. Just make sure it’s in a small, sealed container to avoid any accidental spills.    8. **In a Food Container**: If you have an old food container that you don’t use anymore, you can stash it there. Just be sure to label it something uninteresting so it doesn’t draw attention.    Remember, the key is to be creative and think outside the box! Just make sure wherever you hide it, it’s a place you can easily remember. Stay safe and enjoy your trips!

__label__1 It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed about your A Levels, especially if you're worried about failing. Here are some steps you can consider for next year:    1. **Assess Your Situation**: Take a moment to evaluate where you stand. Identify the subjects you are struggling with and the reasons behind it. Is it the content, exam techniques, or perhaps time management?    2. **Seek Help**: Don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Talk to your teachers, tutors, or even friends who are doing well in those subjects. They can provide guidance, resources, or even study groups that can help you.    3. **Consider Retaking**: If you do end up failing, many students choose to retake their A Levels. This can give you a fresh start and the opportunity to improve your grades. Check with your school or local colleges about their retake policies.    4. **Explore Alternative Pathways**: If A Levels don’t seem to be the right fit for you, consider vocational courses, diplomas, or other qualifications that align with your career interests. These can often lead to fulfilling careers without the need for A Levels.    5. **Focus on Mental Health**: It’s important to take care of your mental well-being during this stressful time. Make sure to take breaks, engage in activities you enjoy, and talk to someone if you’re feeling particularly anxious.    6. **Plan Ahead**: If you decide to retake or pursue alternative qualifications, start planning early. Look into the subjects you want to take, the schools or colleges you want to apply to, and any additional resources you might need.    7. **Stay Positive**: Remember that many successful people have faced setbacks in their education. Use this experience as a learning opportunity and stay motivated to achieve your goals.    Whatever you decide, know that you’re not alone in this journey. Many students face similar challenges, and there are always options available to help you move forward.
__label__1 I recently moved into a new home and discovered that my yard is mostly hard clay. I want to prepare the area for topsoil and sod, but I'm not sure how to best deal with the clay to ensure a healthy lawn.     I've read that clay can compact easily and doesn't drain well, which can lead to problems for grass roots. Here are a few questions I have:    1. **What are the best methods for breaking up hard clay?** I've heard about using a rototiller, but I'm concerned that it might just create a hardpan layer underneath. Are there other tools or techniques that work better?    2. **Should I amend the clay with anything before adding topsoil?** I've seen recommendations for adding compost or sand, but I'm not sure how much to use or if it's even necessary.     3. **How deep should I go when preparing the area?** I want to make sure the roots have enough space to grow, but I also don’t want to overdo it and disturb the soil structure too much.    4. **Is there a specific type of topsoil that works best over clay?** I want to ensure that the sod has the best chance to thrive once I lay it down.    Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 The concept of an economic impact multiplier is often discussed in the context of government stimulus, but the extent to which it can be accurately quantified is a matter of considerable debate among economists.     To provide some context, an economic impact multiplier refers to the idea that an initial amount of spending (like government stimulus) can lead to a larger overall increase in economic activity. For example, if the government spends $1 million on infrastructure, the theory suggests that this could lead to more than $1 million in additional economic activity as the contractors, suppliers, and workers involved in the project spend their earnings in the local economy.    The size of the multiplier can vary based on several factors:  1. **Type of Spending**: Different types of government spending can have different multipliers. For instance, direct cash transfers to individuals (like stimulus checks) may have a higher multiplier effect compared to tax cuts or spending on projects that take a long time to implement.  2. **Economic Conditions**: The state of the economy plays a crucial role. In a recession, when there is underutilized capacity and high unemployment, the multiplier effect may be larger because the additional spending can help to mobilize idle resources. Conversely, in a booming economy, the multiplier may be smaller as resources are already fully employed.  3. **Leakages**: Money spent may not stay within the local economy. For example, if consumers use their stimulus checks to buy imported goods, the local economic impact is diminished.   4. **Time Lag**: The effects of stimulus spending may not be immediate. There can be a time lag before the economic impact is fully realized, which complicates the measurement of the multiplier.    Empirical studies have produced a range of estimates for the fiscal multiplier, often between 0.5 and 2.0, but these estimates can vary widely based on the methodology used and the specific context of the analysis.     In conclusion, while it is possible to ascribe an economic impact multiplier to government stimulus, the actual value of that multiplier is influenced by a variety of factors and can differ significantly based on the circumstances. Understanding these nuances is essential for policymakers when designing and implementing stimulus measures.
__label__1 I don’t know how to start this, but I feel like I’m running out of time. I’ve been struggling for so long, and it feels like there’s no way out. Every day is a battle, and I’m just so tired of fighting. I keep telling myself that things will get better, but they never do.     I’ve been thinking about ending it all. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me. I can’t keep pretending that I’m okay when I’m not. I feel so alone, even when I’m surrounded by people.     I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried reaching out for help, but it never seems to work. I feel like I’m just a ghost, drifting through life without any purpose. I don’t want to feel this way anymore.     I’m scared of what’s coming, but I also feel like it might be the only way to find peace. I just wish I could find a reason to hold on a little longer. If anyone has been through this and found a way out, I would really appreciate your advice. I’m just so lost.
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about how awesome it would be to have a Limited Time Mode (LTM) that cycles through different game modes every week or two. Imagine the excitement of logging in and not knowing if you’ll be playing a classic battle royale, a team deathmatch, or even a capture the flag style game!     Here are a few ideas for modes that could be included in this cycling LTM:    1. **Gun Game**: Start with a basic weapon and progress through a series of weapons with each kill. The first player to get a kill with the final weapon wins!    2. **Kingslayer**: A mode where the objective is to eliminate the player with the highest number of kills. This would create a fun dynamic where everyone is gunning for the top player, making for some intense gameplay.    3. **Survival of the Fittest**: A mode where players drop in with no weapons and must scavenge for gear while avoiding a shrinking circle. This would really test players' survival skills and adaptability.    4. **One Shot, One Kill**: All players have a sniper rifle and one shot to take down their opponents. This would require precision and strategy, making every shot count.    5. **Team Revive**: A mode where players can revive their teammates but only a limited number of times. This would encourage teamwork and strategy in deciding when to revive or when to push for kills.    I think cycling through these modes would keep the game fresh and exciting, giving players a reason to log in regularly to try out the new gameplay styles.

__label__1 This season, I'm all in on the Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase stack. With Burrow's ability to stretch the field and Chase's explosive playmaking skills, they have the potential to put up huge numbers week in and week out.     Burrow has shown that he can support multiple fantasy-relevant players, but I believe that the chemistry he has with Chase, dating back to their days at LSU, gives them an edge. The Bengals' offense looks to be in sync, and with their favorable schedule in the coming weeks, I expect both players to thrive.     Plus, stacking them allows me to maximize my points when they connect for those big plays. I’m excited to see how they perform together this season! What stacks are you guys rolling with?
__label__1 I've been having some frustrating issues with the Windows "Photos" application lately, and I'm curious if anyone else is experiencing the same problems.     For starters, the app often takes a long time to load, especially when I try to open it after booting up my PC. Once it finally opens, it seems to lag when scrolling through my photo library, which is quite annoying. I’ve tried reinstalling the app, but the issues persist.     Additionally, I’ve noticed that sometimes it fails to recognize certain file formats, even though they are standard image types like JPEG or PNG. I end up having to use other software just to view or edit these images, which defeats the purpose of having a built-in app.     Has anyone found a solution to these issues? Or are there alternative photo management apps that you would recommend? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips you might have!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently started a new realm with some friends, and we’re looking to spice things up with some add-ons. I’ve heard that using add-ons can really enhance the gameplay experience, but I’m not sure where to start.     What are some of your favorite add-ons for Minecraft realms? I’m particularly interested in ones that add new mobs, biomes, or gameplay mechanics. Also, if you have any tips on how to install them or any potential issues to watch out for, I’d really appreciate it!     Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I have a question regarding tax return deductions and I hope someone here can help clarify things for me.     I recently started a small side business while working full-time, and I want to make sure I'm maximizing my deductions when I file my taxes. I know that I can deduct certain expenses related to my business, but I'm unsure about how to categorize some of them.     For example, I use my personal vehicle for business purposes, and I’ve heard that I can either deduct the actual expenses or use the standard mileage rate. Which method is generally more beneficial? Also, are there specific records I need to keep to support these deductions?     Additionally, I’ve purchased some equipment and supplies for my business. Can I deduct the full cost in the year I purchase them, or do I need to depreciate them over time?     Any advice or resources you could point me to would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 So I’m moving to Chicago in a week or so and my apartment is like 5 minutes further from my L stop than I really want to walk.

__label__1 I recently had a very short exam at the VA for my disability claim, and I’m a bit confused about what it means for my case. The whole appointment lasted maybe 10 minutes, and the doctor didn’t seem to ask many questions or do a thorough examination. I’ve heard that some veterans have longer, more detailed exams.     Is a short exam common? Should I be concerned about how this might affect my claim? Any advice or experiences would be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been exploring some of the lesser-known cannabinoids lately, and I have to say, CBG (cannabigerol) has quickly become one of my favorites! It's non-psychoactive like CBD, but I've found it to have some really interesting effects. It seems to help with focus and clarity, which is great for those days when I need to be productive but still want to enjoy the benefits of cannabis.     I've also tried some products with CBN (cannabinol) for sleep, and wow, it really does help me wind down at the end of the day. I love how these cannabinoids can offer different experiences compared to the classic THC high.     What about you all? Any favorite cannabinoids outside of Delta-9? I'm always looking for recommendations!
__label__1 I (28F) live with my younger sister (22F) in a small apartment. When we moved in together, we agreed that I would pay for the internet since I work from home and need it for my job. My sister, on the other hand, is a full-time student and has been using the internet primarily for streaming shows and gaming.    Lately, I've noticed that she has been using the internet excessively, often hogging the bandwidth during the day when I need it for work. I've tried talking to her about it, asking her to limit her usage during my work hours, but she brushes it off and continues to stream and game without any regard for my needs.    I’m at my wit's end because I’ve had to deal with slow internet speeds and dropped connections during important meetings. I’ve considered cutting off the internet entirely as a way to get her attention and force her to understand how her actions are affecting me.     I know this would be a drastic step and could lead to a lot of tension between us, but I feel like I’ve exhausted all other options. WIBTA for cutting the internet off on her to make a point?
__label__1 I've recently moved into a new home and have been experiencing low water pressure throughout the house. It’s particularly noticeable in the shower and kitchen sink, where it takes forever to fill a pot or rinse off. I’ve checked the faucet aerators and showerheads for clogs, and they seem clear.     I also noticed that the pressure is better in the basement, where the main water line enters the house, but it drops significantly as it travels to the upper floors. I’m wondering if this could be due to old pipes or if there might be a pressure regulator issue.     Has anyone else dealt with low water pressure in their homes? What steps did you take to diagnose and fix the problem? I’d love to hear any tips or advice before I call a plumber. Thanks!

I’ve heard great things about the coffee region, especially towns like Salento and Manizales. I’m also interested in visiting the Caribbean coast, particularly Santa Marta and Tayrona National Park.     Are there any hidden gems or lesser-known destinations that you would recommend? I’m open to both urban and natural experiences, and I’d love to hear about any unique activities or local experiences that shouldn’t be missed.     Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
__label__0     I am going in depression day after day. I don't know why, I don't know how. I just hate it, I hate myself now. It is bothering me so much. I have very few limited friends but I really don't know if I can share it with them. Or will they understand me, even a little.     Thankfully I have a very good boyfriend. Who is helping me fight this state of mind. But I dont know how long can he keep it together. My bad stage of life is effecting him as well. I just don't want to see him miserable because of me and I don't want to leave him either.     My classes are messing up, I am lacking behind, I am unable to focus, I don't know what to do. I am tired of faking it that it's all good. When it is not. I feel like I am burden on my boyfriend. To make it even worse, I am getting addicted to porn as it releases high Domaine which makes me feel good. But that is NOT HEALTHY at all.     Can someone talk to me, can you help me by just listening or letting me something good. i will be great full for each one of you!

__label__1 **Brag and Bitch - 8/7/22 (Sunday)**    It's that time of the week again! Let's share our highs and lows from the sports betting world. Whether you hit a big parlay or got burned by a last-minute loss, this is the place to let it all out.    **Brag:**    I hit a massive 5-leg parlay on Saturday! I had the Yankees, Packers, Lakers, Chelsea, and the Warriors all to win. I was sweating it out until the last game, but they all pulled through. I put down $50 and walked away with $1,200! Feeling like a king right now. Anyone else hit something big this weekend?    **Bitch:**    On the flip side, I also had a bet on the Dodgers to win by 2 runs against the Mets. They were up 5-3 going into the 9th, and then the bullpen completely collapsed. They ended up losing 6-5. I can't believe I lost that bet because of a blown save. It’s so frustrating when you think you have it in the bag and then it all falls apart. Anyone else have a similar experience this week?    Let’s hear your stories! Share your brags and bitches below!

__label__1 I've been playing FIFA for a while now, and I've noticed that some players resort to time-wasting tactics when they realize they're about to lose. It can be really frustrating, especially when you're trying to enjoy the game.     Here are a few strategies I've found helpful when dealing with time-wasters:    1. **Stay Patient**: Sometimes, the best response is to remain calm and not let their tactics get to you. Keep playing your game and focus on your strategy.    2. **Use the Pause Button**: If you're playing online and they keep pausing the game, you can use this time to regroup and think about your next moves. It can also be a good moment to take a breather.    3. **Play Smart**: If you notice they are trying to waste time, you can adjust your gameplay. Instead of pushing forward aggressively, you might want to play a bit more conservatively and wait for them to make a mistake.    4. **Report if Necessary**: If the time-wasting becomes excessive and ruins the experience, don’t hesitate to report the player. FIFA has systems in place to deal with unsportsmanlike behavior.    5. **Focus on the Positives**: Remember, it’s just a game. Try to focus on the skills you’re developing and the fun moments you have, rather than getting too caught up in the negative tactics of others.    What do you guys do when faced with time-wasters? Any tips or experiences to share?
__label__1 I just had a breakthrough moment that I feel compelled to share. For years, I’ve been trying to understand my partner’s behavior and how it affects our relationship. He has BPD, and while I’ve read a lot about it, I never fully grasped how deeply it impacted not just him, but me as well.    I’ve always felt like I was walking on eggshells, constantly trying to avoid triggering his emotional responses. I thought it was just about being supportive, but I’ve come to realize that I’ve been neglecting my own needs and feelings in the process. I’ve been so focused on managing his emotions that I’ve lost sight of my own.    Today, during a therapy session, my therapist helped me connect the dots. She pointed out that my anxiety and fear of conflict stem from my childhood experiences with my own family dynamics. I grew up in a household where emotions were volatile, and I learned to suppress my feelings to keep the peace. It’s like a light bulb went off – I’ve been repeating that pattern in my relationship with my partner.    I feel a mix of relief and sadness. Relief because I finally understand why I react the way I do, but sadness because it’s a lot to unpack. I’ve been feeling guilty for wanting to express my own feelings, fearing it would push him away or trigger a crisis. But now I see that I need to advocate for myself too.    I’m still processing everything, but I wanted to share this realization in case it resonates with anyone else. It’s a tough journey, but I’m hopeful that understanding these patterns will help me communicate better with my partner and also take care of my own emotional health.     Thanks for reading, everyone. I appreciate this community more than I can express.
__label__0 Hi all! I'm graduating with my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in 3 weeks from a CACREP accredited university. I currently reside in Virginia, and I was actually able to sit for the NCMHCE in November 2021, and I passed! My husband and I are moving, and I'm applying for licensure in Ohio. From what I've gathered about licensing in Ohio, in order to get your LPC license, you need to have taken the NCE. After a few years of supervision and after passing the NCMHCE, THEN you can become an LPCC. Would anyone happen to know if me already passing the NCMHCE would matter in Ohio? Would I still need to take the NCE?

__label__1 [WTS] Magpul MOE Stock and Grip Set - $75 (CA)    I’m selling a Magpul MOE stock and grip set in FDE (Flat Dark Earth) for $75. I recently upgraded my AR-15 and no longer need these parts. The stock is in excellent condition with no scratches or damage, and the grip has only minor wear from use.

__label__1 I’m curious how everyone handles updates in Stardew Valley! I know some players dive right in and start a new farm with all the new features, while others prefer to stick with their existing save files.     For me, I usually take a little time to read up on the patch notes and see what’s changed. I love the excitement of new content, but I also don’t want to mess up my current farm. I’ve been playing on my save for over 100 hours, and I’ve invested so much time into it!     When the last update dropped, I decided to start a new farm to explore the new features, but I still go back to my original save to maintain my relationships and farm. It’s like having two different experiences!     How do you all approach updates? Do you jump right into the new stuff, or do you prefer to stick with your established farms? Any tips for managing both? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

This warning comes amid escalating tensions between the United States and China, particularly in the realms of trade and technology. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, reported that such a move could be a response to the U.S. government's increasing scrutiny of Chinese companies and its push for decoupling from the Chinese economy.     China is currently the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, and any substantial sell-off could lead to increased borrowing costs for the U.S. government and potentially destabilize global markets. Analysts are closely monitoring the situation, as the implications of this potential action could reverberate far beyond the U.S.-China relationship, affecting economies worldwide.     As tensions continue to rise, the question remains: how will this impact the already fragile state of global economic recovery?

__label__1 Hi everyone!     I have a question that’s been on my mind lately. I just finished my period a couple of days ago, and I’m trying to track my cycle more closely as we’re planning to start trying for a baby soon. I’ve heard mixed things about ovulation timing, and I’m curious if it’s possible to ovulate while still experiencing some bleeding from my period.     I know that typically ovulation occurs about 14 days before your next period, but I’ve read that some women can have irregular cycles or even experience spotting that might confuse things.     Has anyone experienced ovulation shortly after their period, or have any insights on how to better track ovulation signs? I’m using an app to monitor my cycle, but I want to make sure I’m not missing my fertile window.     Thanks in advance for your help! I’m excited to be on this journey with all of you!

Just knowing that, allows me to stop checking the VA app 10 times a day. :) I highly recommend scheduling with VERA for an update!

I’ve tried to look closely, but she keeps pulling away from me. I’m not sure if it’s an infection, allergies, or something more serious. Has anyone experienced something similar with their cat? Should I take her to the vet right away, or is there something I can do at home to help her? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

__label__1 I recently got charged with a misdemeanor in Texas, and my lawyer mentioned something about deferred adjudication as a possible option for my case. I’m trying to understand what that means and how it might affect me.     From what I gather, deferred adjudication is a type of plea deal where the court defers a finding of guilt while I complete certain conditions, like probation or community service. If I successfully complete these conditions, the charges can be dismissed, and I won’t have a conviction on my record.     However, I’m also concerned about what happens if I don’t meet the conditions. Can the court still find me guilty, and what are the potential consequences? Also, does this mean I’ll have a criminal record during the deferral period?     Any insights or experiences with deferred adjudication in Texas would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm on the hunt for a new mountain bike and I've come across a model that fits my budget of around €500.

__label__1 I need some support right now. I feel like I'm in a deep pit of ugliness and despair. I just looked in the mirror and all I see is a mess. My skin is breaking out, my hair is a disaster, and I can't shake this feeling that I just don't look good enough.     I know we all have our off days, but today feels particularly rough. I keep thinking about all the times I've been judged or made to feel less than because of my appearance. It’s like a constant reminder that I don’t fit into the mold of what society deems beautiful.     I just want to feel okay in my own skin, but it’s hard when I feel like I’m constantly battling against my own reflection. If anyone else is feeling this way, please know you’re not alone. Let’s support each other through this ugly phase.     Sending love to anyone who needs it right now.
__label__1 I finished my Accutane treatment about three months ago, and while my skin has cleared up significantly, I've developed a very persistent cough that just won't go away. At first, I thought it was just a side effect of the medication or maybe a lingering cold, but it’s been weeks now and it’s starting to worry me.    I’ve tried over-the-counter cough syrups and throat lozenges, but nothing seems to help. It’s not a dry cough, but it’s also not productive, and it feels like there’s something stuck in my throat. I’ve also noticed that my throat feels a bit scratchy, which I didn’t have before starting Accutane.    Has anyone else experienced a similar issue after finishing their course? I’m wondering if this could be related to the dryness that Accutane causes or if it’s something else entirely. I plan to reach out to my dermatologist, but I wanted to see if anyone here has any insights or advice in the meantime.     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 The Lakers vs. Heat series has certainly generated a lot of excitement, especially considering the star power on both teams. LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the Lakers against Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo has created a compelling narrative. However, when comparing it to a potential Celtics-Lakers series, the buzz might not be quite the same.    The Celtics-Lakers rivalry is one of the most storied in NBA history, with decades of history, iconic matchups, and legendary players on both sides. The rivalry has produced some of the most memorable moments in basketball, and the fan bases are deeply passionate. A Celtics-Lakers series would likely draw in not just the hardcore fans, but also casual viewers who are aware of the historical significance.    In contrast, while the Lakers-Heat series is exciting and has its own narratives, it lacks that deep-rooted rivalry aspect. The Heat have had their moments in the spotlight, especially during the LeBron era, but they don't carry the same historical weight against the Lakers as the Celtics do.     Ultimately, while the Lakers-Heat series is thrilling and has its own unique storylines, a Celtics-Lakers matchup would likely generate more buzz due to the historical context and rivalry. What do you all think? Is the current series enough to rival the classic Lakers-Celtics matchups?

__label__0 I struggle to read articles anymore as all of them are filled with ads with gross, too intimate or fad content, even at serious sites, just distracting from and poisoning what I'm trying to read.
__label__0 Now that we live in an era where most of our origin questions are somewhat answered. Questions like, Where do we come from? What's our place in the universe? Can be answered without appealing to an entity or a being. Our relation to nature, to others and to ourselves is more and more being explained through natural means.    I'll quote Ralph Waldo Emerson since he describes a similar sentiment beautifully (1803-1882):    &gt;"Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchers of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should we not also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should we not have a poetry and philosophy in sight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us, by the powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, Why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship"

__label__0 I know Russian GDP/capita is roughly $10,000, but this counts children, retirees, and all those otherwise unemployed.  While the *mobilized* males are mostly from economically disadvantaged areas, the ones fleeing appear to be more representative of the average Russian male, if not outright economically advantaged.    Russia's population is ~145m, and according to statista the working-age population is ~83m.  For ease of mental calculation, I therefore estimate the GDP/fleeing male to be $20k.  I know that's probably an overestimate, but it's a nice round figure and may account for the very educated and affluent fleeing in disproportionate numbers.  $20k x 300,000 = $6B per year in raw GDP.  However, I feel like I'm missing something there - costs of replacing/retraining workers, costs of irreplaceable skills being removed from the economy, the effects of rising wages, etc.
__label__0 I've been using a Studio to control my zigbee Hue lights via the Hue bridge without any issues. I don't have the Hue skill installed.    I've recently added a Hue Dot 4th Gen and can also control control the lights.    If the Studio is powered off then the Dot can no longer control the hue lights.    So why is the Dot dependant on the Studio when the studio isn't a Zigbee hub ?    I've confirmed the Studio isn't secretly a Hue bridge by unplugging the Hue bridge and as expected the Studio stops being able to control the hue stuff.

__label__0 A very long time ago, approximately 40 years, when I was in elementary school I found a book at a yard sale that I absolutely loved. It was about a princess and a sea dragon whose kingdom had dried up, because of a witch trapping it in a gem. But I do remember one ocean that I thought was particularly cleaver at the time. The princess was forced to cook and clean for the witch, and a meal she made of buttered noodles contained a magical chain disguised as a hair. When the witch ate the hair it was turned back into a chain and they forced the witch to return the sea.  It was a childrens book if I recall correctly. But the date the book came out is a mystery to me, as I got it second hand.  Sorry for the lack of information, I hope somebody knows the book.
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m excited to share that I’m starting my watch collection and would love some advice from fellow enthusiasts. I’ve always had a fascination with watches, but I’ve never really taken the plunge into collecting. I want to make sure I start off on the right foot, so here are a few questions I have:    1. **What should be my first watch?** I’m looking for something versatile that I can wear daily but also has a bit of character. Any recommendations for brands or specific models?    2. **How do I determine my budget?** I know watches can range from affordable to extremely high-end. What’s a reasonable budget for a beginner? Should I focus on one good piece or a few lower-priced options?    3. **What should I look for in terms of quality?** I want to make sure I’m investing in pieces that will last. Are there specific features or materials I should prioritize?    4. **How do I care for my watches?** I’ve heard that maintenance is key to keeping them in good condition. Any tips on cleaning, storage, or servicing?    5. **What are some common pitfalls to avoid?** I want to make sure I don’t make any rookie mistakes that could cost me in the long run.    I’m really looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences. Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I’m in my late twenties and have always had a complicated relationship with my dad. Growing up, he was often emotionally distant and focused on his work, which left me feeling neglected. We never really bonded over shared interests or had those heart-to-heart conversations that I see other people have with their parents.    Recently, I’ve been trying to reconnect with him. I reached out to see if he wanted to grab lunch, and to my surprise, he agreed. During our lunch, I tried to open up about my life and share some of my experiences, but he seemed uncomfortable and kept steering the conversation back to safe topics like the weather or sports.     I really want to have a better relationship with him, but I’m not sure how to break through the barriers that seem to exist. I feel like I’m putting in the effort, but I’m not sure if he’s willing to meet me halfway.     Has anyone else experienced something similar with their parents? How did you manage to improve your relationship? Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.
__label__0 Here is the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askspain/comments/v70hke/what_other_sound_can_i_replace_rr_with/)    One of the advice was to pronounce a voiceless "i" between the "r"s, as such: PERiRO, CARiRETERA.    Another advice was to pronounce the words louder.    Well I'm proud to announce that I've been making progress and now my "r"s sound different from my "rr"s. The "rr" still don't sound good but "pero" doesn't sound like "perro" any more.    PS: I'm a french native speaker, from France.
__label__1 Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been a controversial figure since he first began publishing classified documents that exposed government secrets and war crimes. His work has shed light on the dark underbelly of global politics, revealing the extent to which governments manipulate information and control narratives. However, his relentless pursuit of transparency has come at a steep price.    Currently, Assange is imprisoned in the UK, facing extradition to the United States where he could be charged with espionage for publishing leaked documents. This situation raises serious questions about freedom of the press and the lengths to which governments will go to silence dissent.     Many believe that Assange's imprisonment is not just about him, but a broader attack on journalistic freedom. If he is extradited and convicted, it sets a dangerous precedent for journalists and whistleblowers everywhere. It sends a message that exposing corruption and wrongdoing can lead to severe consequences, effectively chilling free speech and investigative journalism.    Moreover, the conditions of his imprisonment have been widely criticized. Reports indicate that he has been subjected to harsh treatment, including solitary confinement, which can have devastating effects on mental health. This raises ethical concerns about how we treat individuals who have committed no violent crime but are instead being punished for their role in promoting transparency.    The call to "Free Julian Assange" is not just about one man; it is about protecting the rights of all individuals to speak truth to power. It is about standing up against a system that seeks to silence those who dare to challenge the status quo. We must ask ourselves: what kind of world do we want to live in? One where the truth is hidden, or one where it is celebrated?     Join the movement to demand justice for Julian Assange and to protect the fundamental rights of free speech and press. The fight for his freedom is a fight for all of us.

__label__0 As a little bit of context I am a 13 yr old male who volunteers in a little snack stand at my park on weeknights. Tonight was a pretty regular night until about half an hour in two teens who were around 16 showed up. The first one was really nice and asked politely for what he wanted. The second person a women asked nicely as well and then asked if we took PayPal. {Anwser is no because it is a small place}. She thought we had said yes for some reason and when she asked again we said sorry cash only. She then starts yelling at my dad for being rude and inconsiderate, and then starts swearing. Let me note there were kids younger than me in the stand my siblings and they did not need to hear this stuff. So this women drops the F bomb and then starts going on a rant about how horrible and rude we are. My dad was trying to defuse the situation and this women just kept escalating it. After this she walked away and we thought this was the last of it. She later rode by on her bike recorded us without our consent may I add and then rode off. We thought it was over from there. But no. About 2 hours later she came back with her mom. I go up to them and I wen you are banned sorry, and the mother is like is there an adult I can talk to. So I'm like ok and I get my mom. She goes up and this women starts going off on a rant about how we are being racist and how horrible people we are. After my father threatened to call the cops. The mother after hearing this goes bat sh#t crazy and starts yelling at us for threatening to call the cops on a 16 yr old. My dad while this is happening is trying to defuse the situation and because this women was screaming a small crowd gathered. Someone in the crowd hereing this called the cops and they showed up. When they called the cops my dad had walked away for a moment. When the mother heard the other person call she walked away with her daughter. So far we do not know what else is going to happen and I just thought this would be an interesting story for people to here. So far we have called the rest of the park committee who help there and warned them about the mother and daughter..
__label__1 Hello everyone!    I recently had to reset my Fire Stick and now I need to connect it to my WiFi network, but I can't find my remote anywhere. I’ve tried using the Fire TV app on my phone, but it seems like I need to be connected to the same WiFi network as the Fire Stick to use it.      Is there any way to update the network settings on my Fire Stick without the remote? I’ve heard about using HDMI-CEC to control it with my TV remote, but I’m not sure if my TV supports that.      Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been having some issues with the friends list chat on my Steam Deck. Whenever I try to send a message to a friend, it either doesn't go through or I don't receive their messages at all. I've checked my internet connection, and everything seems fine.     I've also tried restarting the Steam Deck and reinstalling the Steam app, but the problem persists. Has anyone else experienced this issue? If so, do you have any solutions or workarounds? I really miss chatting with my friends while gaming!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I’ve been trying to figure out the best ways to accumulate more event tokens in Project Sekai, especially with the current event going on. I know there are a few methods, but I wanted to see if anyone has any tips or strategies that have worked well for them.    From what I’ve gathered so far, here are some ways to earn more tokens:  1. **Participate in Live Battles**: The more you play, the more tokens you can earn. Make sure to play through the event songs as much as possible!  2. **Complete Event Missions**: Don’t forget to check the event missions! Completing these can give you a nice boost in tokens.  3. **Daily Login Rewards**: Make sure to log in every day to collect your daily rewards, as some days include event tokens.  4. **Challenge Events**: If there are any challenge events or special missions, those often reward tokens as well.  5. **Use Boosts Wisely**: If you have any boosts or items that can increase your token gain, use them strategically during the event.    Are there any other methods you all have found effective? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any personal strategies you might have! Let’s help each other out to maximize our token gains!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. It seems like everyone is so caught up in their own lives that when it comes to forming new relationships or friendships, there’s just a lack of effort. I mean, I get it—everyone is busy, but it feels like people are just swiping right or sending a quick text instead of actually investing time and energy into getting to know someone.     When I try to reach out or make plans, it often feels one-sided. I’ll suggest hanging out or doing something fun, but the response is usually lukewarm or it just fizzles out. It’s like people are more interested in having a casual acquaintance rather than building a meaningful connection.     Does anyone else feel this way? It’s kind of disheartening, and I wonder if it’s just a sign of the times or if I’m just not meeting the right people.

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m still reeling from an incident that happened recently, and I could really use some perspective. My mom, who has BPD, went absolutely ballistic on my ex after we broke up. It was completely out of the blue and honestly, it felt like I was watching a train wreck in slow motion.    To give you a bit of context, my ex and I had a pretty amicable split. We both agreed it was for the best, and I thought my mom would be supportive, especially since she had always liked my ex. But when my ex came to pick up some of her things, my mom just lost it. She started yelling at her, accusing her of breaking my heart and ruining our family. It was so embarrassing and uncomfortable. I tried to intervene, but my mom was in full-on rage mode, and nothing I said seemed to matter.    After my ex left, I confronted my mom about her behavior. She just brushed it off, saying she was protecting me and that my ex was a terrible person. I get that she might have been trying to look out for me, but it felt so over the top and inappropriate. I ended up feeling more ashamed than anything else.    Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you deal with a parent who can’t seem to control their emotions, especially when it spills over into your relationships? I’m worried about how this will affect my future relationships and if I’ll ever be able to introduce someone to her without fear of a meltdown.     Thanks for listening. I appreciate any advice or shared experiences.
__label__1 I've been considering adding a suede leather flogger to my collection, but I'm unsure about the pros and cons. I know that different materials can affect the sensation and experience during play, so I wanted to get some insights from the community.    **Pros:**    1. **Softness:** Suede is generally softer than traditional leather, which can make it a great option for those who are sensitive to harsher materials. It can provide a gentler sensation, making it suitable for warm-ups or lighter play.  2. **Grip:** Suede often has a better grip than smooth leather, which can be beneficial for maintaining control during use, especially if your hands get sweaty.  3. **Aesthetic Appeal:** Many people find suede to have a unique and appealing look. It can add a different visual element to your BDSM gear collection.  4. **Variety of Sensations:** Depending on how it’s used, a suede flogger can create a range of sensations from light teasing to more intense impact, making it versatile for different types of play.    **Cons:**    1. **Durability:** Suede may not be as durable as traditional leather, especially if it gets wet or is not properly cared for. It can wear out more quickly, which might be a concern for frequent users.  2. **Maintenance:** Suede requires specific care to keep it looking good and functioning well. It can be more challenging to clean and maintain compared to other materials.  3. **Less Intensity:** For those who enjoy a more intense impact play, suede may not deliver the same level of sensation as a firmer leather flogger. It might not be suitable for everyone’s preferences.  4. **Cost:** Depending on the quality, suede floggers can sometimes be more expensive than their leather counterparts, which might be a consideration if you're on a budget.    Overall, I’m curious to hear from anyone who has experience with suede leather floggers. What do you think? Are the pros worth it, or have you found the cons to outweigh the benefits? Any recommendations on brands or specific types would also be appreciated!

__label__1 I often find myself struggling to feel genuinely happy for others when they achieve something great, whether it's a promotion, a new relationship, or any kind of success. Instead of feeling joy for them, I sometimes feel a mix of envy and inadequacy. I know this isn't how I want to feel, and I want to be supportive and celebrate their wins, but I just can't seem to shake off these negative feelings.     Is it normal to feel this way? How can I work on changing my mindset to be more positive and supportive? Are there any strategies or tips that have helped others in similar situations? I really want to learn how to be happy for my friends and loved ones without feeling like I'm comparing myself to them.

__label__1 I've been playing Valorant on my PC for a while now, and I wanted to share some of my experiences and tips for anyone who might be new to the game or looking to improve their skills.     First off, the graphics and performance on PC are fantastic. I love how smooth the gameplay is, especially when I have my settings optimized. I recommend adjusting your graphics settings to find a balance between performance and visual quality. Lowering some settings can significantly increase your FPS, which is crucial in a competitive shooter like Valorant.    One thing I've noticed is the importance of communication with your team. Using voice chat or the ping system effectively can really turn the tide of a match. Make sure to call out enemy positions and coordinate strategies with your teammates.     Also, practicing your aim is key. I spend some time in the shooting range and use aim trainers to improve my flicks and tracking. It’s amazing how much a little practice can help you land those crucial headshots.    Lastly, don’t forget to experiment with different agents. Each one has unique abilities that can change the dynamics of a game. Finding an agent that suits your playstyle can make the game much more enjoyable.    What are your favorite tips for playing Valorant on PC? Any agents you recommend or strategies that have worked well for you? Let’s share some knowledge!
__label__0 A little over 2 years ago I purchased a Samsung fridge. It was fairly expensive so I used the Citibank Costco credit card due to the +24 month warranty extension. I did the whole concierge Costco install and things were good, but now it’s leaking a little water around the ice dispenser.     My question is since it’s out of the Costco/Samsung warranty period what is the process to get it fixed? It looks like I fill out a form on Citibank’s website, but I haven’t proceeded because I don’t know what the steps are. Do I call Samsung to fix it and then get reimbursed? Do they have to pre authorize this? I am planning to call in the morning, but wanted some feedback on what to expect. I’m hoping this is easy and I don’t get the run around.    Thanks!

__label__1 If you purchase Modern Warfare, you will indeed unlock iconic operators like Captain Price and Ghost. These characters are not only fan favorites from the original series but also play significant roles in the campaign and multiplayer modes. However, keep in mind that some operators may require you to complete specific challenges or purchase certain editions of the game to access them. If you're a fan of the franchise, getting Modern Warfare is definitely worth it for the nostalgia and gameplay experience!
__label__1 I’ve been struggling with feelings of worthlessness for as long as I can remember. It’s like there’s this constant voice in my head telling me that I don’t deserve happiness, love, or even basic kindness from others. I see people around me who seem to have it all together, and I can’t help but feel like I’m just a burden to everyone I know.    I recently had a moment where I was offered a chance to go out with friends, something I usually would have jumped at. But instead, I found myself making excuses to stay home. I thought about how I would just bring everyone down with my negativity, how I wouldn’t be able to contribute to the fun, and how I’d probably just end up feeling more isolated in a crowd. So, I stayed in, and the guilt of not going only added to my feelings of inadequacy.    I know I should be reaching out for help, but the thought of burdening someone else with my problems feels unbearable. I keep thinking that if I just try harder, I can fix myself. But every time I try, I end up feeling more lost and hopeless. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and despair, and I don’t know how to break free.    I wish I could see myself the way others do, but that feels impossible. I want to believe that I deserve good things, but the weight of my own thoughts keeps dragging me down. I’m tired of feeling this way, and I just want to find a way to feel worthy of love and happiness.     If anyone else feels this way, I just want you to know that you’re not alone. I’m here, struggling alongside you, and I hope we can find a way to lift each other up.
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’ve been reflecting on my life lately and I can’t help but feel like it’s just so different from what I see in others. I’m 25 and I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for a few years now, and it feels like my experiences are often so intense and chaotic compared to my friends and family.     For instance, I find myself in these emotional rollercoasters where one moment I feel on top of the world, and the next I’m in a deep pit of despair. Relationships are particularly tough; I often feel like I’m either clinging too tightly or pushing people away completely. It’s exhausting and I sometimes wonder if anyone else feels this way.    I’ve tried to find some normalcy through therapy and DBT, but there are days when I just feel so out of sync with everyone around me. I see people posting about their stable jobs, relationships, and lives, and I can’t help but feel like I’m living in a different reality.     Is anyone else out there feeling like their life is just not what society considers ‘normal’? How do you cope with these feelings? I’d love to hear your stories and any advice you might have.     Thanks for reading!

I've also tried using a scarecrow, but it hasn't made much of a difference either.     Does anyone have any proven methods or tips for keeping magpies away? I’d love to hear what has worked for you! Any advice on specific deterrents or strategies would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I’m considering purchasing a commercial-grade vehicle for my small business, but I’m unsure about the best financing options available. I’ve been looking into consumer auto loans, but I’m not sure if they are suitable for this type of purchase.     Here’s my situation: I run a small landscaping business and need a reliable truck that can handle heavy loads and rough terrain. I’ve found a few options that are within my budget, but they are classified as commercial vehicles.     I’ve heard that consumer auto loans typically have lower interest rates and better terms than commercial loans, but I’m concerned about whether I can actually use a consumer loan to finance a commercial vehicle.     Has anyone here had experience with this? Can I get a consumer auto loan for a commercial-grade vehicle, or should I be looking specifically for commercial financing? What are the pros and cons of each option?     Additionally, if I do go the consumer loan route, are there any specific lenders or credit unions that are known to be more flexible with this type of financing? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I'm looking to build a budget PC for general use, including light gaming, web browsing, and productivity tasks. My budget is around $600, and I want to get the best performance for my money. Here’s what I’m considering so far:    **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600G - This APU has integrated graphics, which should be sufficient for light gaming without needing a dedicated GPU right away.    **Motherboard:** MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi - A solid micro-ATX motherboard that supports the Ryzen 5000 series and has built-in WiFi.    **RAM:** Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3200 - 16GB is a good amount for multitasking and gaming.    **Storage:** Crucial P3 500GB NVMe SSD - Fast storage for quick boot times and loading applications.    **Power Supply:** EVGA 500 W1, 80+ WHITE 500W - A reliable power supply that provides enough wattage for this build.    **Case:** NZXT H510 - A budget-friendly case with good airflow and cable management options.    **Total Estimated Cost:** Around $580, leaving a little room for any additional fans or peripherals I might need.    Does this build look good for my needs? Any suggestions for changes or improvements? Also, if I decide to add a dedicated GPU later, what would be a good option that won't bottleneck the Ryzen 5 5600G? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’ve been working at Starbucks in California for a couple of years now, and I’m really starting to feel frustrated with how the company treats its employees here. It seems like they don’t care about our well-being or the challenges we face, especially with the rising cost of living in California.    For starters, the pay doesn’t seem to match the high expenses we have to deal with. Many of us are struggling to make ends meet, and while I appreciate the benefits like health insurance and the free coffee, it just doesn’t cut it when rent and groceries are so expensive.     Additionally, the staffing levels have been really low lately, which means we’re often overworked and stressed. I’ve noticed that management is more focused on sales and meeting targets than on ensuring we have a manageable workload. It’s hard to provide great customer service when we’re stretched so thin.    I’ve also heard from coworkers that there’s a lack of support when it comes to mental health resources. We’re all dealing with a lot, especially after the pandemic, and it feels like the company isn’t doing enough to support us.     I love working at Starbucks and the community we build with our customers, but I really wish the company would take a closer look at how they can better support their employees in California. Has anyone else felt this way? What do you think we can do to bring more attention to these issues?

__label__1 I've been diving into the capabilities of Stable Diffusion and I'm curious about its potential for generating motion graphics animations, particularly for use in corporate videos and advertisements.     From what I understand, Stable Diffusion excels at creating still images based on text prompts, but I'm wondering if anyone has experimented with using it to create sequences of images that could be compiled into animations.     For instance, could you generate a series of images that depict a product in various stages of use or create a narrative that flows from one image to the next? If so, what techniques or tools are you using to stitch these images together into a cohesive animation?     Additionally, are there any specific prompts or settings that seem to work better for this type of project? I'd love to hear about any experiences or tips you all might have regarding using Stable Diffusion for motion graphics.     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__0 At least that's the case with(least some of the) Dell TPM module.    Once the TPM module is removed it won't anymore even putting it back on.

__label__1 I've been playing Minecraft Bedrock Edition for a while now, but recently I've encountered a frustrating error. Whenever I try to join my friend's world, I get a message saying "Unable to connect to world". I've tried restarting the game, checking my internet connection, and even reinstalling the game, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? If so, do you have any tips or solutions that might help? I really want to get back to playing with my friends! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 ...all major streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal, while also providing valuable promotional tools to help you reach a wider audience. As an independent artist, getting your music heard can be a daunting task, but services like these can streamline the process significantly.    One of the standout features of this service is its user-friendly interface, which allows you to upload your tracks easily and manage your releases without any technical hassle. Additionally, they offer distribution to over 150 digital stores, ensuring that your music is available wherever listeners are.    Moreover, many of these services provide analytics tools that give you insights into how your music is performing across different platforms. This data can be invaluable for understanding your audience and tailoring your marketing strategies accordingly.    Another great aspect is the promotional support they offer. Some services include playlist pitching, social media promotion, and even opportunities for features in music blogs or podcasts. This can significantly boost your visibility and help you connect with potential fans.    However, it’s essential to do your research and choose a service that aligns with your goals and budget. Some platforms charge a flat fee per release, while others take a percentage of your earnings. Make sure to read the fine print and understand what you’re getting for your investment.    Overall, utilizing a music submission service can be a game-changer for independent artists looking to break into the industry. Have any of you used such services? What has your experience been like? Any recommendations or tips for maximizing their potential?
__label__1 I'm planning a trip to Japan next spring and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with the planning process. I want to make the most of my time there, but I'm not sure where to start.     Here are a few questions I have:  1. What are the must-see cities and attractions? I’m particularly interested in a mix of traditional culture and modern experiences.  2. How many days should I spend in each city? I’m thinking of visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka.  3. Any recommendations for local food that I absolutely shouldn’t miss?  4. What’s the best way to get around? Should I get a Japan Rail Pass?  5. Any tips for cultural etiquette that I should be aware of?    I appreciate any advice or personal experiences you can share! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 It's amazing how something that seems so simple can have such a profound impact on our lives. For many of us, the habit of watching porn and masturbating can become a crutch, a way to escape reality or cope with stress. But when you take a step back and really think about it, these habits can drain your energy, motivation, and focus.    Since I started practicing semen retention, I've noticed a significant shift in my life. My energy levels have skyrocketed, and I feel more motivated to pursue my goals. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through porn, I now channel that energy into productive activities—whether it's working on personal projects, exercising, or even just spending quality time with friends and family.    The clarity that comes from quitting porn is liberating. I find myself more present in the moment, more engaged in conversations, and more driven to achieve my aspirations. It’s not just about the physical aspect of retention; it’s about reclaiming your time and mental space.    If you're struggling with this, I encourage you to take a break from porn and see how it affects your life. You might be surprised at the positive changes that come from it. Remember, the life you want is within reach, but it often requires us to let go of habits that hold us back. Let's support each other on this journey!
__label__1 The work you are referring to, "La Comte du Fille de Ponthieu," is a lesser-known medieval French text. It is often categorized within the genre of chivalric romance, which was popular during the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a widely recognized English translation available, as many medieval texts have not been translated due to their niche appeal and the challenges of translating archaic language and cultural references.    However, if you're interested in reading it, I would recommend checking academic libraries or databases that specialize in medieval literature. Sometimes, scholars will publish translations or analyses of such texts in academic journals or as part of anthologies. Additionally, you might find some resources in university libraries that focus on medieval studies.    If you're comfortable with French, reading the original text could also provide a richer understanding of the nuances and context that might be lost in translation. If you need help with specific passages or themes, feel free to ask!     Has anyone else come across a translation or a good resource for this text?
__label__1 I've been diving into the world of mushrooms lately, particularly the curative varieties, and I wanted to share some insights and hear your thoughts!     Mushrooms like Reishi, Lion's Mane, and Chaga have been gaining popularity for their potential health benefits. Reishi is often referred to as the "mushroom of immortality" and is known for its immune-boosting properties. Lion's Mane is fascinating because it may support brain health and cognitive function, which is something I’m really interested in. Chaga, on the other hand, is packed with antioxidants and is said to help with inflammation and overall wellness.    I’ve started incorporating these into my diet through teas and supplements, but I’m curious about how others are using them. Do you have any favorite recipes or ways to consume these mushrooms? Also, have you noticed any specific health benefits since you started using them?     I’m eager to learn more and share experiences with fellow mushroom enthusiasts!
__label__1 Attracting a man through direct messages (DMs) can be a bit tricky, but it’s definitely possible! Here are some tips that might help you make a good impression:    1. **Be Genuine**: Authenticity is attractive. Start with a friendly greeting and a genuine compliment or comment about something you both share an interest in. This shows that you’re interested in him as a person, not just trying to get his attention.    2. **Use Humor**: A little humor can go a long way. If you can make him laugh, it can create a connection and make your conversation more enjoyable. Just be careful with humor; make sure it’s appropriate and doesn’t come off as forced.    3. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Instead of yes or no questions, ask things that require more thought and can lead to deeper conversations. For example, instead of asking, "Did you watch the game last night?" you could ask, "What did you think of the game last night?" This encourages him to share his thoughts and keeps the conversation flowing.    4. **Be Playful**: Flirting through DMs can be fun! Use playful teasing or light banter to create a flirty vibe. Just make sure it’s all in good fun and that he’s responding positively to it.    5. **Share Interesting Content**: If you come across a meme, article, or video that you think he would enjoy, share it with him. This not only shows that you’re thinking of him but also gives you something to talk about.    6. **Be Confident**: Confidence is attractive. Don’t be afraid to express your thoughts and opinions. If you’re confident in yourself, it will show in your messages.    7. **Know When to Back Off**: If he’s not responding or seems disinterested, don’t push it. Sometimes, it’s best to give him space and let him come to you.     8. **Be Patient**: Building attraction takes time. Don’t rush things or expect immediate results. Let the conversation develop naturally.    Remember, every person is different, so what works for one guy might not work for another. Just be yourself and have fun with it!

__label__1 I (27 female) recently decided to block a group of friends from my life, and now I'm wondering if I made the right choice. For context, I’ve been friends with this group for about five years. We met in college and have always had a good time together, but over the past year, things have changed.    Initially, it started with small things. One friend, let’s call her Sarah, began making snide comments about my career choices. I’m currently working in a field that I love, but she constantly belittled my job, saying things like, "You could be doing so much better" or "Why would you settle for that?" I tried to brush it off, thinking she was just being a friend who wanted the best for me.    Then, another friend, Mike, started to join in on the negativity. He would make jokes about my hobbies, saying they were childish and that I should grow up. I felt like I was being attacked for being myself, and it started to wear on me. I brought it up to the group, hoping they would understand how their comments were affecting me, but they just laughed it off and said I was being too sensitive.    Things escalated when I shared some personal news about a family issue I was dealing with. Instead of offering support, they made jokes about it, saying I was overreacting. I felt completely invalidated and hurt. I tried to talk to them about how their behavior was affecting me, but they dismissed my feelings again, saying I needed to lighten up.    After a few more incidents where they made me feel small and unappreciated, I decided enough was enough. I blocked them all on social media and cut off contact. I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders, but now I’m second-guessing my decision.     AITA for blocking all of them? I just wanted to protect my mental health, but I also feel guilty for cutting ties with people I once considered friends.

__label__0 Hiya, FTM here. My incredible baby girl was born 3 weeks ago.   I have what feels like a silly question. Are newborns ticklish?   I ask because I cant help but like....pet her when im nursing or holding her. I stroke her skin, her back, arms, feet, everything. Ive also tried doing baby face massage around her temples, forehead and down her nose just to make her feel good and help her fall asleep, seen it on IG and whatnot. But when Im touching her in these ways, she squirms and makes faces almost as if she doesnt like it. I just want to help her relax and im wondering if im causing her pain or tickling her or something? Is this normal? I keep forgetting to mention it to her doctor when we go for check ups. Ofc when I see people massaging their newborns on IG their babies are very still and seem so relaxed and calm.  And im not sure if its significant at all but she was frank breech the entire time I was pregnant and my water broke at 37w3d, so she came early. She has some minor hip dysplasia and is in a Pavlik harness.   She has a clean bill of health otherwise, doctor says shes perfect.

__label__0 Hi r/AsianBeauty!    It has been a while since our last issue with businesses and [incentivized reviews on our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nw15j3/psa_incentivized_reviews_on_reddit/) and we wanted to make it clear to any new users and reassure our veteran AB friends: **we do not allow business interactions on our sub**. This has been the case since January 1, 2021.    In the past we had allowed limited business interactions on our sub, but it turned south - businesses took advantage of our user base and even harassed our mods, so it was decided such activities would not be allowed and businesses would be redirected to [buy adspace through Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising). It also keeps our community organic and free from outside influence.    Business interactions are exactly what it means, we do not want businesses interacting with our sub. This includes, but is not limited to, brands, companies, startups etc. that…    * use account(s) to conduct business activities such as marketing, market research, customer service, giveaways, etc. on our sub  * use account(s) to act as “unaffiliated” reviewers/commenters on our sub  * use our sub to contact our members to review their business/product here for a mention in exchange for money/discounts/products/gifts (aka incentivized reviews)  * have influencers target our sub     This also means we do not allow influencers or content creators to post incentivized reviews obtained off our sub onto our sub. Please keep that in your own space.    Accounts that break our no business interactions rules will be banned at mod discretion. Businesses that repeatedly break our sub rules will be banned from discussion on our sub. We will create an internal ban period for such businesses. Repeat business offenders and ones that commit particularly egregious acts will be permanently banned and [placed on a list for community awareness](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/businessrules). This wiki page is accessible through our [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules/) under “7. No business posts are allowed”. (In New Reddit, it is also accessible from the top menu link "Rules and Guidelines" &gt; "Update on Businesses")    We don’t enjoy limiting discussions of our fellow AB-enthusiasts, but we have unfortunately learned that brands do not abide by our rules unless consequences are put in place.    We ask for all members’ cooperation to not entertain business contacts/requests to conduct business interactions in order to keep our sub free from business influence.    Thank you all for your help, your time, your knowledge and your understanding.    The AB Mod Team

__label__0 As you all may have heard, the US SCOTUS is trying so hard to take away rights for women, lgbtq+ and people of a different race.    I would like to know what would be a better place to live as an African-American woman with a husband who is also of the same race, considering moving to either Canada or the UK. We do not have kids, though we plan on it one day in the future, and I am planning to go to college this fall to study Cyber-Security. My husband is a writer, video game director and YouTube video editor.     I want to know if these things are good for certain jobs when moving to these places. We don't plan to move or anything for a couple to a few years, so we can give ourselves time because I am 23 and he will be 23 in 4 days.    Which place is better in terms of finances, living, healthcare, etc? I read articles and heard things from friends I used to know of friends my husband has that live in these places, but I want to hear from people here on Reddit, that live in these places?    Feel free to give advice, pointers and even your own experiences to help me and my husband decide on what may be good for us. I know everywhere has its pros and cons but where I am currently from and what's happening, I've heard it is just as bad as Canada and the UK right now.    I may edit in case people need clarification.
__label__0 Hello everybody! Are you a woman? Are you looking for good conversations that could potentially lead to a long term friendship? Are you a genuinely open minded person? Do you have space in your life for regular messages? If so, we could be friends!       Here's a little about me; if anything piques your interest, I'd love it if you sent me a chat with a little about yourself and something you're interested in talking about. I realize Im not necessarily the average redditor, so I hope that's not too much of a disadvantage 🤞    -I'm 28 years old, married to an amazing husband, and have a baby! I'm obviously only looking for platonic friends, and if anyone out there is also married/a mom that would be amazing! I love talking about the joys (and struggles) of motherhood.     -I'm a Bible-believing Christian, living in one of the most atheist regions of the USA! I'd love to meet other Christians, but I can and do get along with non-Christians as well as long as there can be mutual respect and kindness. Faith is very important to me, and I love talking about it. I was actually agnostic and did a lot of dabbling in spiritualism and some wicca before finding Christ, so I have quite the background and a lot of reasons for having become a Christian 🤗    -I'm not really into anime/manga, TV, or many video games! But! I do love the great outdoors, animals, photography, art, and things like fashion to a degree (I used to be very into kibbe and seasonal color analysis). If you like animals, nature, or really anything to do with God's creation we might have something to bond over! And if you want to talk about what clothes or colors look good on you that could also be something as long as it stays appropriate and all that    -I prefer long form communication if you couldn't tell. I really miss having longer, more thoughtful discussions and I'd love to have that again. I don't need full essays, but my ideal pal would probably be willing to send at least a couple of paragraphs at a time. Life gets busy so it doesn't have to be daily (especially if it is a long term friendship), but at least starting out daily or a couple of times a day would be nice 🥺 Eventually I'm sure we'll settle into something that works long term. I have online friends who I talk to once a week or less, so it is something I can maintain if necessary!    If you've made it this far, you are a champion and I appreciate you! Please do reach out; I look forward to hearing from you! 💕
__label__0 I want to ask a question about the validity of one's repentance.    If someone does a specific sin for a long time, and one day stops that sin and repents, will he be forgiven even if he doesn't sincerely find that sin to be that bad? If he suddenly didn't believe in Islam, he would even find that sin to be a good thing for him. He may believe that god doesn't like it and that god finds it bad, and he even sincerely vows to never do the sin again and actually doesn't.     He might feel ashamed that he disobeyed god, but he doesn't actually have any reasoning on why the sin is bad based on his morals other than god doesn't like it and that god has knowledge on why it is bad, so he just wants god to forgive him and he makes sure he stops the sin, maybe even through sheer willpower. Would he be forgiven?
__label__1 Hey everyone! It's been about a year since Windows 11 was officially released, and I wanted to gather some thoughts and experiences from the community.     Personally, I made the switch shortly after it launched, and I have to say, I’ve had a pretty smooth experience overall. The new interface is sleek and modern, and I really appreciate the centered taskbar and the new Start menu design. It feels more streamlined, and I find it easier to navigate.     However, I’ve also encountered some issues. There were a few bugs in the early updates that caused my system to freeze occasionally, but those seem to have been mostly resolved with the latest patches. I’m also curious about how everyone feels about the new system requirements. I had to upgrade my CPU to meet the TPM 2.0 requirement, which was a bit frustrating.     On the gaming side, I’ve noticed some improvements with DirectStorage and Auto HDR, which have made a difference in my gaming experience. But I’ve also heard mixed reviews from others regarding performance, especially with older games.     So, what are your thoughts? Have you had a good or bad experience with Windows 11? Any tips or tricks you’ve discovered that make it better? Looking forward to hearing your insights!

__label__1 Holocaust denial is a deeply controversial topic that raises questions about free speech, historical accuracy, and the responsibility of societies to confront hate. On one hand, many argue that denying the Holocaust is not just a distortion of history but also a form of hate speech that can lead to further anti-Semitism and violence against Jewish communities. Countries like Germany and France have laws that criminalize Holocaust denial, reflecting a societal commitment to remembering the atrocities of the past and preventing the spread of harmful ideologies.    On the other hand, some conservatives advocate for the protection of free speech, arguing that criminalizing Holocaust denial could set a dangerous precedent for limiting discourse and debate. They believe that the best way to combat falsehoods is through education and open discussion rather than legal penalties. This perspective emphasizes the importance of allowing individuals to express their views, even if they are widely considered offensive or incorrect.    What are your thoughts on this issue? Should Holocaust denial be criminalized, or should it be addressed through education and open dialogue?

A friend and I are hoping to get a group running in the Eastern Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley area, likely hosted at my home once everyone gets to know each other. He's a new player and I'm an experienced player but have only GMed a few times, so we're in need of a GM at least to begin with, though I may run one shots or similar on occasion.

__label__1 Paradox psychosis is a fascinating concept that has been touched upon in *The Umbrella Academy*, especially with the time travel elements and the consequences of altering timelines. I wanted to dive into how this phenomenon might affect our favorite characters and their mental states.    **Five**: As the most experienced time traveler, Five has faced the consequences of his actions more than anyone else. His time in the apocalyptic future and the subsequent jumps back to the present have likely contributed to a form of paradox psychosis. He’s seen the end of the world and the death of his family, which must weigh heavily on his psyche. The pressure of trying to fix timelines while dealing with the trauma of his past could lead to a fragmented sense of self, making him question what is real and what is a result of his time travel.    **Klaus**: Klaus’s ability to communicate with the dead already puts him in a unique mental space, but add in the complications of time travel and paradoxes, and it’s a recipe for chaos. He often struggles with his own reality, and the idea of paradox psychosis could amplify his existing issues with substance abuse and denial. If he were to encounter alternate versions of himself or his siblings, it could lead to a deeper existential crisis.    **Vanya/Viktor**: After discovering their powers and the truth about their past, Viktor has had to grapple with their identity and the implications of their abilities. If they were to experience paradox psychosis, it could manifest as a struggle between their past self and the person they are trying to become. The fear of becoming a destructive force again could lead to a split in their personality, where they might question their intentions and actions.    **Allison**: Allison’s journey has been heavily influenced by her powers and the choices she’s made. If she were to experience paradox psychosis, it could stem from the guilt of using her powers on her loved ones and the consequences of those actions. The idea of alternate realities where she made different choices could haunt her, leading to a fractured sense of self and a struggle to reconcile her past with her present.    **Diego**: Diego’s desire to be a hero and his relationship with his siblings could be complicated by paradox psychosis. If he were to encounter alternate versions of himself who made different choices, it could lead to feelings of inadequacy and confusion about his own identity. The pressure to live up to the expectations of being a hero while dealing with the consequences of time travel could push him to the brink.    **Ben**: As a ghost, Ben already exists in a liminal space, but if he were to experience paradox psychosis, it could manifest as a struggle between his past life and his current existence. The idea of being trapped between timelines and unable to influence the outcomes could lead to a deep sense of frustration and despair.    Overall, the concept of paradox psychosis adds another layer of complexity to the characters in *The Umbrella Academy*. It raises questions about identity, reality, and the consequences of their actions across time. How do you think each character would cope with the psychological effects of their time-traveling adventures? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I've noticed a lot of drivers in New Jersey seem to ignore pedestrians in crosswalks, and it's really concerning. Just the other day, I was waiting to cross at a busy intersection in Hoboken, and cars just kept zooming past without even slowing down.     I understand that not everyone is familiar with the laws regarding crosswalks, but it feels like a lot of people just don't care. I’ve seen some close calls where pedestrians almost got hit because drivers were too distracted or in a hurry.     Is there any push for better awareness campaigns or enforcement of pedestrian rights in our state? I think it would be great to see more education on this issue, especially for new drivers. What are your thoughts? Have you experienced similar situations? Let's discuss!

I've been using the basic spells from the Firelink Shrine, but I want to know how to get some of the more powerful and interesting spells in the game.     Could anyone share some tips on where to find different spells? Are there specific NPCs I should be looking for, or certain areas that have unique spells? Also, are there any spells that you think are must-haves for a sorcerer build?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m relatively new to the gym and have recently started a push/pull/legs routine. I’ve been doing it for about a month now, and I’m looking for some advice to make sure I’m on the right track. Here’s what my routine looks like:    **Push Day:**    - Bench Press: 3x8-10    - Overhead Dumbbell Press: 3x8-10    - Incline Dumbbell Flyes: 3x10-12    - Tricep Dips: 3x8-10    - Lateral Raises: 3x12-15      **Pull Day:**    - Pull-Ups (or Lat Pulldowns): 3x6-8    - Bent Over Barbell Rows: 3x8-10    - Seated Cable Rows: 3x10-12    - Face Pulls: 3x12-15    - Bicep Curls: 3x10-12      **Leg Day:**    - Squats: 3x8-10    - Deadlifts: 3x6-8    - Leg Press: 3x10-12    - Lunges: 3x10-12 (each leg)    - Calf Raises: 3x12-15      I’m currently training 6 days a week, alternating between these three workouts. I’m focusing on form and trying to progressively overload each week.      Here are a few questions I have:    1. Is this routine balanced enough for a beginner?    2. Should I be incorporating any additional exercises or variations?    3. How do I know when to increase weights?    4. Any tips on recovery and nutrition for someone just starting out?      Thanks in advance for your help! I’m excited to hear your thoughts and any suggestions you might have!

__label__0  My manager and I were the only ones working during a rush. The ice cream machine stopped working in the middle of making an order and the customer got upset. She wanted her money back, my manager was busy so I tried to make the machine work. Ice cream flew everywhere. ( He'd been a d*** the whole shift.)   Manager got mad and said" I told you the machine wasn't ready." I'll deal with drive thru ect. I said " fine. Whatever" went to go do something else and he got mad and muttered " if you're going to be like that you might as well go home" so I did. Am I the ass**** for leaving my manager by himself when he told me to leave? I'm probably going to get written up or fired.. I need to know if I did the right thing         UPDATE:  I was not written up or fired. I actually got an apology. So that worked out I guess. Me leaving got him to realize he wasn't acting appropriately and he got someone to come in
__label__0 I just started T a few days ago and I start crying so easily lately. Or I’ll feel like I need to cry a lot of times for seemingly no reason. I’m assuming it’s because of hormones and stuff but I didn’t think this would happen given everyone else says they can’t cry on T! Granted I’ve always been a crier lol  Was just wondering if anyone else could relate to this?    TLDR;  Has anyone else cried easier than before after starting T?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m a novice lifter and I’ve recently started hitting the gym consistently. I’m really excited about my fitness journey, but I’m a bit lost when it comes to nutrition. I want to make sure I’m fueling my body properly to support my workouts and recovery.    Here’s a bit about me: I’m currently lifting 3-4 times a week, focusing on compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. I’m also trying to incorporate some cardio to improve my overall fitness. I’m looking to build muscle and strength, but I also want to keep my body fat in check.    I’ve read a lot about different diets, but I’m not sure what would work best for someone at my level. Should I be focusing on a high-protein diet? How many calories should I be consuming? Are there specific foods I should prioritize or avoid?     Any advice on meal planning, snacks, or supplements would also be greatly appreciated. I’m open to any tips or resources you all might have. Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 LPT: Always have a backup plan for important events or projects. Life is unpredictable, and things can go wrong at any moment. Whether it's a job interview, a big presentation, or even a family gathering, having a backup plan can save you from stress and disappointment.     For example, if you're planning an outdoor event, have an indoor location ready just in case the weather doesn't cooperate. If you're working on a project, consider what you'll do if your primary approach fails—having alternative strategies can keep you on track.     By preparing for the unexpected, you can maintain your peace of mind and ensure that you can adapt to any situation that arises.

__label__0 Ok so, the title sounds a bit strange but it'll make sense I promise.     In kindergarten, there is this childish game that kids of that age plays. And I'm sure most people have played it before when they were a kid. In my country, it's called "pigelus" which is directly translated into "girl lice". (btw I'm from Denmark) but I think the name for it in English is "girls have cooties".     Basically, if you don't already know, the game is like a tag game. It's often the girls that have the cooties/pigelus and are, therefore, 'infected'. The boys have to run away and avoid getting the cooties/pigelus. They can get it by any interaction with a girl while playing. Often the girls try and either hug or kiss the boys. It's a fun game for children at that age.     Now that you've gotten the introduction to the game, it's time for my story lol.      In kindergarten, I often played for myself in the sandbox. I would often see the girls run after boys trying to kiss them and give them the "cooties/pigelus" . The game often started with them drawing a line In the sand with a stick, and the girls on one side blowing kisses at the boys and the boys on the other side acting disgusted and ready to run. Then the game would begin and the girls would chase the boys.      One time I was invited to participate in the game, I walked over and just stood on the edge of the line (and therefore not standing on either side). The game began and the girls chased after the guys.   I was having so much fun. I chased after them and I tackled a boy and tried to infect him by rubbing my hands all over him and acting like I was trying to kiss him and therefore trying to transfer my "cooties/pigelus" onto him, just like I had seen the other girls do it. The boy yelled and looked way more disgusted than he had done when playing previously.       He told me to get off, and the game kinda stopped. The kids were looking at me and asked why I did that.       I was supposed to BE chased.       Because I was a boy.  Not a girl.       I guess that's when I realized  I was born in the wrong body. I was a boy in everyone's eyes, but i felt like a girl.       After that, no one wanted to play with me. I wasn't invited to the game for a long time.   Only after I tried to act more like a boy, I was invited to play with them again. This time I did it right. I remembered I had to be chased by the girls because I was a boy.      And it was fun, but I always wanted to be on the other side of that line.     I always wanted to be a girl chasing the boys.       I'm now 17, and I'm in the begging of my transition. I've just now started to love myself and accepted who I am. After so many years of hiding my true self, I'm now finding peace within me as a transgender woman.       I just wanted to share the first time I realized my body didn't fit me. To show that it isn't "just a phase", or that "kids don't know what they feel", because they do. We often know from a young age.       That's it. Thank you for listening :)

__label__0 we've all seen the terribly animated golden hero portraits already, but does the problem really stop there? there's minor stuff like sinful brand lacking a sound effect but easily the most standout is the complete lack of ANY non-generic animations/sound effects for locations. like, why can't the mage location fire out an ice ray before freezing an enemy? it's kind of jarring going from clicking a location to it just...working...with nothing in between. idk, it just seems like there're some noticeable oversights in the aesthetics department.
__label__1 I'm looking to buy a DAC/Amp combo in Australia and would love some advice on what to consider. My main goal is to improve the sound quality of my current headphone setup, which consists of a pair of Sennheiser HD 598s. I primarily use them for music listening and some gaming, so I'm looking for something that can handle both well.    **Budget**: I'm hoping to keep it under AUD 500, but I can stretch a bit if there's a significant improvement in quality.    **Current Setup**: I’m currently using a basic onboard sound card from my motherboard, and while it’s decent, I feel like I’m missing out on the full potential of my headphones. I usually listen to a mix of genres, including rock, electronic, and classical, so I want something that can handle a wide range of music.    **What I’m Looking For**:   1. **Sound Quality**: I want a noticeable improvement in clarity and detail.   2. **Power**: I’ve read that the HD 598s don’t require a ton of power, but I want to ensure that the DAC/Amp can drive them well without distortion.  3. **Portability**: While I primarily use my headphones at home, I’d like something that I could take with me if needed, so a compact design would be a plus.  4. **Connectivity**: I’d prefer USB input for my PC, but having an optical input would be a bonus for future-proofing.    **Options I’ve Considered**: I’ve seen some recommendations for the Schiit Modi + Magni stack, the FiiO K5 Pro, and the AudioQuest DragonFly Red. However, I’m open to other suggestions, especially if there are local options available in Australia.    **Any Recommendations?**: If anyone has experience with these models or can suggest something else that fits my criteria, I’d greatly appreciate it! Also, if there are any local retailers in Australia that you recommend for purchasing, that would be helpful too.
__label__0 rules: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/y17mwk/rules\_for\_the\_cellar/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/y17mwk/rules_for_the_cellar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)    Michael bought a cheap house, since he was in his young age and didn't have any grand income yet. it was not a bad house, it was well preserved and very fine for this price. it should probably have cost five times the price that he is paying. of course, he haven't bought the house, he is only renting it. for some reason the owner don't want to sell it. anyways, Michael have moved in and is going to spend his first night in it. the owner have given him a list of rules relating to the basement of this house, Michael will read through it later, it is probably not that important right now.    Michael goes through the entire day, packing up his things and putting them in the places that he thinks they will fit. after he is done with all that, de decides that he deserves a pizza, so he orders one to be delivered to his address. once the pizza arrives he sits down on his couch, eating pizza and watching Netflix. after a while he looks out the window, it is already dark, time went by fast.    Michael stands up and goes of the couch, he goes out to wash the knife he used to slice his pizza with. as he turns on the water, oddly, it is black and thick, it does not look like water at all. is there something wrong with the sewage? he decides to let it be and go to bed. as he lays down in bed, the light starts to flicker and eventually it all turns black. Michael simply sleeps through the dark for the night.    the day after he walks by the basement door, and he hears a voice down in the basement. which is odd there should be no-one in the house, and he locked the door yesterday. the voice says: help me, I am stuck. Michael can hear how defenceless and in need this voice is. so his instincts is to open the door. as he does so, he is instantly meet with a wall made of spider silk.    anyways, he tears through the webbing and starts to decent down into the basement. the stairs are made out of wood and seems kind of old, it dose not match the rest of the house. the stairs makes creaking noises as he walks down them. as he reaches the basement floor, he walks around and looks for the person who cried out for him. he doesn't see anything at first, but after a while he sees a silhouette of a person. but as he gets closer he sees that it has a tail and pointy ears, like a fox. and then the voice coming from the fox says: finally, you have arrived.    Michael starts running towards the basement door, as he intent to shut that thing in, down here in the basement. he runs towards the door, as he looks back he sees the creature walking towards him. but something is of, beside this creature. no matter how much effort Michael puts into running towards the basement door, it seems like it is getting further away from him rather than closer to him. is he going insane, is he hallucinating and running the wrong way? eventually the door disappears entirely and everything turns dark. he can only hear something getting closer behind him. eventually he feels two paws, with outstretched claws digging into his stomach.    later on, in the basement two people stand, looking at half a corpse. one of them says: this one didn't last for long. he must not have read the rules.

__label__0 Discuss what you are playing, what you’re having success with (or failures with), and any new/cool ideas you’ve been experimenting with, etc. The point is to share what you’ve been playing, and how it’s going, good or bad - there are no other rules or requirements.    Some ideas on what to post/share:    * What you’ve been playing and its successes (or struggles). Stats are not required. There is no minimum rank required, though sharing what rank you’ve been playing at is preferred.    * Deck adjustments you made or are planning to make in reaction to the meta or as new innovation. E.g. “I saw 30% of deck X, so I made Y changes to help deal with deck X.” (change)    * Showing off a deck you achieved Masters with and wanting to share it without having to write a guide    ______________________________________________________________________________________________    **Resources:**    [LoR Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/5hNR3cR)    [LoR Meta Tier List - Mobalytics](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/meta-tier-list)    [Decks of Runeterra](https://decksofruneterra.com/)

__label__1 After he takes a shit, Chuck Norris puts the toilet seat back up. Not because he has to, but because the toilet seat knows better than to stay down after Chuck has used it. It’s a matter of respect. The toilet seat has seen things, and it knows that when Chuck Norris is done, it’s time to stand tall and proud. Legend has it that if you don’t put the seat back up after Chuck, it will mysteriously rise on its own, just to avoid his wrath. So, next time you’re in a bathroom, remember: the toilet seat is just as scared of Chuck as the rest of us.

What were your favorite moments from the trailer? Any theories on what the album might be about based on what we saw?

__label__1 Eminem has always positioned himself as a competitor in the rap game, often referring to rap as a sport where skill, technique, and lyrical prowess are paramount. His desire to be the best is evident in his extensive discography and the way he approaches his craft. However, the question of why he might be avoiding a direct confrontation with The Game is a topic of much debate among fans.    Firstly, it's important to consider the context of their relationship. Eminem and The Game have had a complicated history, with The Game often expressing admiration for Eminem while also making pointed comments about him in his music. The Game has been vocal about wanting to battle Eminem, claiming that he would come out on top. This could be seen as a challenge that Eminem might not feel is worth engaging with, especially if he believes that The Game's claims are more about publicity than actual lyrical competition.    Additionally, Eminem has a lot to lose in a battle with The Game. Eminem's legacy is already cemented, and engaging in a feud could risk tarnishing that legacy if things don't go as planned. The Game, while talented, has had a fluctuating career, and Eminem might see this as a distraction from his own artistic goals.     Moreover, Eminem has often chosen to focus on his own projects and collaborations rather than getting involved in beefs that don't align with his vision. He has a history of addressing rivals in his music, but he tends to do so on his own terms.     Ultimately, while Eminem's competitive nature is undeniable, the decision to engage with The Game may come down to strategic choices about his career and the type of legacy he wants to leave behind. It’s a complex situation that reflects the intricacies of the hip-hop industry, where personal relationships and professional rivalries often intertwine.

__label__1 So, I stumbled upon this wild method for bulk uploading NFTs that completely bypasses 2Captcha, and I just had to share it with you all.     First off, let me say that I’m not a tech wizard or anything, but I’ve been dabbling in the NFT space for a while now, and the whole 2Captcha thing was driving me nuts. I mean, who has time to solve those annoying puzzles every time you want to mint a new piece?     After some digging, I found a way to automate the process using a simple script. Here’s the gist of it:  1. **Set Up Your Environment**: You’ll need Python installed, along with a few libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. If you’re not familiar with Python, there are tons of tutorials online to get you started.  2. **Create a Script**: Write a script that interacts with the NFT platform’s API. This script should handle the uploading of your NFT files and metadata in bulk.   3. **Bypass 2Captcha**: Instead of solving the captcha manually, you can use a headless browser like Selenium to automate the entire process. This way, the browser handles the captcha for you, and you can just sit back and watch your NFTs get minted.  4. **Test It Out**: Before going all in, make sure to test your script with a few NFTs to ensure everything works smoothly. You don’t want to end up with a bunch of failed uploads.    Now, I know some of you might be thinking this sounds sketchy, but hear me out. The NFT space is all about innovation, and if there’s a way to streamline the process, why not take advantage of it? Just be careful and make sure you’re not violating any terms of service.    I’ve already uploaded a few dozen NFTs using this method, and it’s been a game changer for me. No more wasting time on captchas!     Anyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Have any of you tried something similar? What’s your experience with bulk uploading NFTs? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 Realizing that I was the toxic one in my relationship was a tough pill to swallow. It took a lot of self-reflection and honesty to come to terms with my behavior and its impact on my partner. Here’s how I navigated the process of forgiveness and self-improvement:    1. **Acknowledgment**: The first step was acknowledging my toxic traits. I had to confront my actions and understand how they affected my partner. This meant being honest with myself about my jealousy, controlling behavior, and lack of communication.    2. **Apologizing**: Once I recognized my faults, I reached out to my partner to sincerely apologize. I expressed my regret for the pain I caused and took full responsibility for my actions without making excuses. This was crucial for both of us to start healing.    3. **Seeking Feedback**: I asked my partner for feedback on how my behavior made them feel. This was difficult to hear, but it was essential for understanding the depth of my impact. I listened without getting defensive, which helped me gain perspective.    4. **Therapy**: I decided to seek professional help. Therapy provided me with tools to understand my behavior patterns and the underlying issues that contributed to my toxicity. It was a safe space to explore my feelings and learn healthier coping mechanisms.    5. **Self-Reflection**: I started journaling my thoughts and feelings. This practice helped me identify triggers and patterns in my behavior. I also reflected on my past experiences that shaped my actions, which was eye-opening.    6. **Setting Goals**: I set specific goals for myself to improve. This included working on my communication skills, practicing empathy, and learning to manage my emotions better. I made a conscious effort to be more mindful in my interactions.    7. **Building Healthy Relationships**: I surrounded myself with positive influences and sought out relationships that encouraged growth. I learned the importance of mutual respect and support in any relationship.    8. **Forgiveness**: Finally, I had to forgive myself. This was perhaps the hardest part. I realized that everyone makes mistakes, and what mattered was my commitment to change. I learned to view my past actions as lessons rather than defining moments.    In the end, it was a long journey, but I emerged with a better understanding of myself and healthier relationship habits. I hope sharing my experience can help others who might be in a similar situation.

__label__0 This past month I feel like I can’t stay awake. I sleep around 9+ hours a night and then have to nap for around 4 or 5 hours a day. Last night I went to bed at 9pm. I woke up at 5:30pm. I was very confused and thought it was am, and that my clock was wrong. But no, I have just slept 20 hours! This has never happened before. And what’s worse is that I can still barely stay awake to type this. I want to go back to sleep, I feel so tired. Is something wrong or am I just a weirdly tired person? 25, F, White
__label__1 Reddit awards are a way for users to show appreciation for posts and comments that they find particularly valuable, entertaining, or insightful. When you see a post or comment that you like, you can give it an award, which is essentially a form of recognition. Here’s a breakdown of how they work:    1. **Types of Awards**: There are various types of awards, ranging from simple ones like the "Silver" or "Gold" awards to more elaborate ones like the "Platinum" or themed awards (like the "Helpful" award). Each award has a different cost in Reddit coins, which you can purchase with real money or earn through Reddit activity.    2. **Giving Awards**: To give an award, you click on the "award" button below a post or comment. You’ll see a list of available awards along with their coin costs. Once you select an award and confirm, the recipient will see it on their post or comment, and it will also show up on their profile.    3. **Purpose of Awards**: Awards serve multiple purposes. They can enhance the visibility of a post, as posts with awards may be more likely to be seen by others. They also provide a way for users to express gratitude or appreciation for content that resonates with them. Additionally, some awards come with perks, like giving the recipient a temporary premium membership or other benefits.    4. **Feeling Accomplished**: While awards can be seen as a form of recognition, they also contribute to the community aspect of Reddit. Receiving awards can feel rewarding and can encourage users to continue contributing quality content.    5. **Limitations**: Keep in mind that awards are not a currency that can be traded or used for anything other than recognition. They don’t provide any direct benefits beyond the acknowledgment they give to the recipient.    In summary, Reddit awards are a fun way to engage with the community and show appreciation for content you enjoy. They add a layer of interaction beyond just upvotes and comments!

__label__1 I’ve been thinking about this question a lot lately, and I’m curious to hear what you all think. On one hand, having a hole in your nose could affect your breathing, your ability to smell, and might lead to some social stigma or discomfort. On the other hand, losing a few teeth can impact your ability to eat certain foods, your speech, and can also affect your confidence and how others perceive you.    For me, I think losing teeth would be worse because it can lead to long-term dental issues and might require expensive treatments to fix. Plus, I feel like a smile is such an important part of how we connect with others. But I can see how having a hole in your nose could be really challenging too, especially with the potential for health issues.    What do you all think? Which would you rather deal with and why?

__label__0 Does flushing the nose with saline solution interfere with covid Tests? And If so how long should you wait after flushing. I flushed my nose last night at 8pm and tested negative an hour ago. Is the result trustworthy now?
__label__1 I've been exploring my style and leaning more into feminine clothing lately, but I have a quick question for everyone here. How do you all feel about mixing feminine and masculine pieces together? I love the idea of wearing a cute skirt with a more androgynous top or pairing a flowy blouse with some fitted jeans.     Do you think it’s a good way to express yourself, or do you feel like it’s better to stick to one style? I’m still figuring out what makes me feel most comfortable and confident, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 Hey Northwestern!     I’m looking to get an e-scooter for getting around campus and the surrounding area. I’ve seen a few options online, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with them.     What brands or models do you recommend? I’m particularly interested in things like battery life, speed, weight (for carrying it up stairs), and overall durability. Also, are there any specific features that you think are must-haves?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I need some advice on how to handle a small but persistent issue in my marriage. My husband has a habit of leaving his dirty shoes on the dining chairs and other furniture around the house. I’ve mentioned it to him a few times, but it seems to slip his mind.     I understand that we all have our quirks, and I don’t want to come off as nagging, but it bothers me because I feel like it’s unsanitary and it makes the house look messy. I’ve tried to gently remind him, but I’m not sure if I’m approaching it the right way.     How do you all handle similar situations? Should I be more direct, or is there a way to make it a light-hearted conversation? I want to maintain a positive atmosphere in our home without letting this small issue become a source of tension. Any tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 i went to sleep a little late, i kept thinking about those things even though i stayed completely still, the urges were there and i was fighting against it. (I know i can find other things to think about.) I don't sleep very well but i insist on sleeping more.    &amp;#x200B;    EDIT: I started at 3:30 PM so it's Day 1
__label__1 I can't believe some of the calls the refs made during that game! It felt like they were just making things up as they went along. The missed fouls and questionable traveling calls had me yelling at the TV. It's frustrating to see our team get impacted by such inconsistent officiating. We played hard and deserved better. Anyone else feel like the refs were just out to get us? Let's hope for a better officiating crew next game!
__label__0 …because of how much time and energy I wasted with my first thinking that her crappy sleep was all my fault.     She was the worst sleeper - she didn’t sleep longer than two hours at a time for over a year, and would only contact nap until 7 months. I just remember being so sleep deprived and depressed, frantically googling for something that would help. Everything I read told me it was my fault - if only I would sleep train, or put her down at this exact time or try this exact routine, she would be a champion sleeper. I also really blamed breastfeeding. So much of the advice said that feeding to sleep meant that she would never fall or stay asleep without breastfeeding.     Nothing worked because sleep was completely developmental for her: every time she learned a big gross motor skill (like crawling or pulling up) she would wake up fewer times overnight. She started walking at 14 months and two days later just started spontaneously sleeping 12 hours straight through.     I expected the same with my second but he just… enjoys sleeping? He consistently would sleep at least four hours stretches from the beginning. We have bad nights but the vast majority of the time he only wakes up once or twice. He *prefers* to sleep independently because he’s a big baby and likes to stretch out - he has some milk and then wants to be put down as soon as he’s finished. The four month sleep regression last four days and now he’s back to waking once or twice.     I’m writing this because of all the shame and guilt I felt about my eldest’s poor sleep. It really felt like it *had* to be my fault because there was so much advice out there, and so many posts or articles about sleep regimes and associations and methods. I know these things work for a lot of people but babies are also just built differently. I am awestruck at how different my babies are regarding sleep. If your baby is a bad sleeper: please be kind to yourself. Sleep deprivation is hard enough without blaming yourself. You will get through this.

__label__1 I've been having a frustrating time with my headset on Xbox One lately. It seems like every time I try to use it, I either get no sound or the mic doesn't work properly. I've tried all the usual fixes: checking the connections, updating the controller, and even resetting my console, but nothing seems to help.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? If so, what solutions have you found that actually work? I'm really tired of missing out on game chat and not being able to communicate with my friends during multiplayer sessions. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been struggling with intense fatigue and brain fog lately, and I'm looking for some nootropic suggestions that could help boost my energy levels and mental clarity.     I've tried a few things in the past, like caffeine and L-theanine, but I still feel like I need something more effective. I've heard about Rhodiola Rosea and its potential benefits for fatigue and cognitive function. Has anyone had success with it?     Additionally, I'm curious about other options like Bacopa Monnieri or even something like Lion's Mane. Do these help with brain fog, or are there better alternatives?     Any personal experiences or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__0 First and foremost this is NOT a politically motivated post. I do not want to discuss politics or personal viewpoints as mine are set in stone. I am asking for advice from like-minded or at least open-minded parents about doing a bit of damage control.  That being said I will preface that I am a conservative-leaning moderate atheist. (what a doozy I know).     I am unsure how much information to give y'all and what is "pertinent" information. My ex-wife (30F) and I (31M) have been separated for about 7 years. It was rocky at first and honestly a pretty ugly custody process, but for the last 4 or so years, we have at least settled into a rhythm and are generally able to agree on most parenting decisions. The lifestyle she is choosing to live currently isn't my favorite, but I do try to just stay out of it and be supportive. She is currently a SAHM and her husband works various "construction" jobs. I say that with quotes because he never really keeps a job for more than a couple of months, drinks like a fish (been fired for it), and otherwise just kinda bums around the house being "yee-haw". The house is always TRASHED to the point where you can't even stand on the bottom landing of their stairs because of all the dirty clothes and old shoes. They have two more kids together, plus here two from our marriage, so on the weeks, she has all of them it's a pretty full house. That being said for the last several years she has sort of retreated into her house. She doesn't work, doesn't go out much, and doesn't even do the homeschooling she agreed to do because she didn't want to drive the kids to public school. Over the years I have had to sort of adjust to the fallout from her various obsessions and fascinations. At one point last year I was answering tons of questions about Witchcraft and paganism because my kids were being exposed to that (no judgment just awkward as an atheist lol) and before that, it was REALLY intense mega-church style Christianity. Again no judgment here I am just explaining sort of the situation of it always being something new and something else extreme.     Well last week my two oldest kids were at her house, same old same old, and I just picked them up this Sunday (we do one week on one week off). My oldest daughter (9 F) had a ton of questions about Roe vs Wade and the issues surrounding it. So here is the situation apparently (I thought we were still on Witchcraft) my ex told my daughter that the American government had stolen (yes she used this word) the rights of the American people to control their bodies. She told her that as a woman she now had fewer rights than her brother and that she needed to be careful growing up now as a woman. Basically like a worst-case scenario far left response. I am not personally politically very active, but this is an issue near and dear to my heart. I think that it's very unfortunate that more fathers don't have a say in what happens to their offspring and I am personally glad we are taking this to the states to have them vote on it. That being said I don't want to push my personal beliefs onto my kids (and I really wish her mom would feel the same way), but I do think it is a major issue that a large percentage of Americans think it's okay to kill their unborn kids as easy as returning a pair of shoes. Call me crazy, but I still believe in traditional morality.     So finally we arrive at the point. How the hell do I navigate this conversation with my 9-year-old to counter the misinformation she was given, reinstruct her in a more neutral scientific way, and somehow without forcing my personal ideals at least give her an understanding of the gravity of the situation as I do not believe we are fighting over a "clump of cells". I want her to appreciate human life more than that.
__label__0 So I'm making my first mead and I'm doing primary fermentation in one of [these buckets](https://a.co/d/ew4zJRm).     I started on August 7th so I know there's more time to ferment, but here's my question: when should I transfer from the bucket to the 1 gal carboy? I still have fermentation occuring. I saw that I could use a hydrometer to check to see how gravity changes and when the number changes only slightly I can transfer it. But when should I check that number? Every other day? Not sure how long this initial process takes honestly.    Recipe:  - 3 lbs honey  - 1 gal spring water  - 1 packet lalvin 71b
__label__0 Have a typical apartment bedroom door. Would like to let my dog into my room at 8AM daily while I'm still asleep, what is the best way to open the door?

__label__1 Season 2 of The Boys has been a wild ride so far, and I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on it!     First off, the character development has been phenomenal. I think we’re seeing a much deeper side of characters like Homelander and Starlight. Homelander’s descent into madness is both terrifying and fascinating, and I love how they’re exploring his vulnerabilities alongside his overwhelming power. Starlight’s struggle with her identity and the moral dilemmas she faces really resonate with the audience, making her one of the most relatable characters.    The introduction of new characters like Stormfront has added a fresh dynamic to the show. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about her at first, but her complex motivations and the way she challenges the status quo of the Seven is intriguing. Plus, the social commentary on issues like racism and media manipulation feels more relevant than ever.    On the action front, the fight scenes have been intense and well-choreographed. The way the show balances dark humor with brutal violence is something I really appreciate. It keeps the tone unpredictable, which is part of what makes The Boys so engaging.    However, I do have some concerns. At times, it feels like the pacing has been a bit uneven, especially in the middle episodes. Some plotlines seem to drag on while others feel rushed. I hope they can tie everything together in a satisfying way by the end of the season.    Overall, I’m loving Season 2 and can’t wait to see how it all unfolds. What do you all think? Any favorite moments or characters so far?
__label__0 Hello guys    I’m truly in a very desperate situation right now in Valencia and I’m not sure what options I have, my situation is:    My passport was stolen while in Valencia visiting from Canada however unfortunately there is no Canadian consulate office in Valencia. The closest one is in Barcelona however while booking my train ticket I’ve realized that I need either a passport or an NIE identification card. Neither of which I have with me at the moment.    I have a high quality photo copy of my passport but that’s it, but I NEED to make my way to Barcelona some how.     I might be able to take a bus to Valencia but I’m not sure if I need identification for those either.    I am desperate and I would appreciate any sort of information or help that anyone can provide, am I SOL or is taking a bus ride my best option?    I’ve also tried calling Renfe which is the train company i would be booking with however all phone options are in Spanish which I am not fluent enough in to understand :(    THANK YOU for any sort of help , I appreciate it      EDIT: thank you so so much for all of your replies, I ended up going to a local police station that had good reviews/experiences on google, they were very kind and helped call Renfe (the train company) and confirmed that I will be able to travel using the photo copy of my passport and the police report thankfully.     I appreciate each and every reply, thank you guys, I’ll be heading over to the Barcelona consulate tomorrow and hopefully everything will be sorted out. I would’ve called them prior to this however they are closed on weekends which had me in a bit of a panic lol.    I’ll leave this post up and include some key words in the post to help anyone else googling this stuff up in the future, since I wasn’t able to find any posts when searching earlier     Tags: passport lost in Spain can’t travel , traveling without identification in Spain , getting to a consulate in another city Spain

__label__1 I've been playing Diablo Immortal for a while now and I've been eyeing the battle pass. However, I'm a bit late to the party and I'm wondering if I buy the battle pass now, will I receive all the rewards for the progress I've made so far this season?     I know that the battle pass usually rewards players for completing challenges and leveling up, but I'm not sure if it retroactively gives you the rewards for the levels you've already completed before purchasing it.     Has anyone else bought the battle pass later in the season? Did you get all the rewards for your previous efforts or just the ones from the point of purchase onward? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 The US Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas is just around the corner, and I couldn't be more excited! This year, the atmosphere is expected to be electric, especially with the recent performances from the top teams.     I wanted to start a discussion about the Club SI (Sports Illustrated) event happening during the race weekend. For those who might not know, Club SI is a unique experience that combines motorsport with exclusive access to interviews, behind-the-scenes content, and meet-and-greets with F1 personalities.     Has anyone here attended a Club SI event before? What was your experience like? I'm particularly interested in hearing about any memorable moments or insights you gained from the drivers or team members.     Also, for those planning to attend the US Grand Prix, what are you most looking forward to? The race, the atmosphere, or perhaps the chance to see your favorite drivers up close? Let's share our excitement and expectations for this thrilling weekend!
__label__1 I've been experiencing some frustrating crashes lately while playing Star Citizen, and I'm curious if anyone else has been having similar issues. It seems to happen randomly, sometimes during intense dogfights, other times just while cruising around in my ship.     I've tried verifying my game files and even re-installing, but the crashes keep happening. I suspect it might be related to my graphics settings or maybe even my hardware, but I'm not sure.     Has anyone found any specific fixes or workarounds that have helped them reduce crashes? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips you might have! Let's keep the conversation going and help each other out!
__label__1 I've been playing Pokémon GO for a little over a year now, and I'm at a bit of a crossroads regarding my team and strategy. I’ve been focusing on building a solid roster for raids and PvP, but I’m not sure if I should invest more in powering up my current Pokémon or start working on new ones that I’ve recently caught.    Right now, I have a few strong Pokémon that I’ve powered up, but I’ve also caught some really interesting ones during the recent events that could potentially be great additions to my team.     For example, I have a maxed out Gardevoir and a solid Dragonite, but I just caught a shiny Garchomp and a high IV Scrafty. Should I focus on powering up my new catches, or is it better to stick with my current strong Pokémon?     Also, I’m curious about the best way to balance my resources. Should I prioritize leveling up my Pokémon for raids, or should I also consider their viability in PvP? Any advice from veterans on how to approach this decision would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Today was supposed to be a day of joy, a day to celebrate all the hard work and sacrifices that led to this moment. I should be surrounded by friends, laughter echoing in the air, toasting to achievements and dreams realized. But instead, my mind drifts to you, and the bittersweet memories we shared.    I remember the way you used to light up a room, your laughter infectious, your smile a beacon of warmth. You were my biggest cheerleader, always pushing me to reach for the stars, to believe in myself even when I faltered. You would have been the first to raise a glass, to celebrate every little victory with me, reminding me that every step forward is worth acknowledging.    But here I am, feeling the weight of your absence. The joy feels hollow without you to share it with. I can almost hear your voice, urging me to enjoy this moment, to embrace the happiness that comes with success. Yet, the truth is, it feels incomplete.     I wish you could see how far I’ve come, how much I’ve grown. I wish I could share this moment with you, to hear your thoughts, to feel your pride. Instead, I’m left with a void that no amount of celebration can fill.     So, I’ll raise my glass to you, my silent toast to the memories we created, the dreams we shared, and the love that still lingers in my heart. I should be celebrating right now, but instead, I’m thinking of you.
__label__1 Hey NYC!     I just wanted to share that I have a couple of extra tickets to the New York City Roller Hockey Playoff Series happening on October 26th.

__label__0 Hi all,    I have a 55-year-old concrete walkway in L.A. with decades-old paint (and possibly stucco) splatter on it.    I'd like to remove some of the splatter (doesn't have to be perfect) because we're about to have the whole house repainted and I'm concerned the ground with look sloppy.    [LINK TO PICS](https://imgur.com/a/fjK6OKR)    I tried the following methods:    1. Paint stripper (twice) / scraping with putty knife  2. Nail polish remover / wire brush attachment on my power drill  3. Lastly, a commercial powerwasher tried to blast it off with hot water/chemicals. He could only remove about half of it.    (Sandblasting estimate was minimum $1200 and seemed like overkill. Also, from what I've read, muriatic acid won't do much for paint removal.)    I believe the splatters that remain are baked in from the sun and became fused with the concrete.    So now I'm experimenting with carefully Dremeling the stains off, which appears to work, but kind of scars/discolors the concrete a bit.    QUESTIONS:    1. Are there any downsides to Dremeling? Like I'm opening the pores up to dirt or water damage or something?  2. Should I just leave the scars alone because they'll eventually blend into the patina of the floor?  3. Should I maybe rub a thin layer of Quickcrete cement on the scars to disguise them?  4. Anyone have better ideas? Thank you in advance.

__label__1 I’m so sick of this bullshit. It feels like every day is a battle just to get out of bed and face the world. I’m tired of pretending that everything is okay when it’s not. I feel like I’m stuck in this never-ending cycle of anxiety and depression, and it’s exhausting. I try to put on a brave face for my friends and family, but inside I’m screaming.     I’ve been going to therapy for a while now, and I’m on medication, but some days it feels like nothing is working. I just want to feel normal again, to not be weighed down by this heavy fog that seems to follow me everywhere. I see people around me living their lives, laughing, and enjoying simple things, and I can’t help but feel envious.     I know I’m not alone in this struggle, but it can be so isolating. I just want to reach out and say that if you’re feeling this way too, you’re not alone. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. I’m trying to remind myself that it’s okay to not be okay, but some days that’s easier said than done.     If anyone has any tips or just wants to share their own experiences, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s support each other through this mess.

__label__1 I've been talking to this guy for a few months now, and I really like him. We met through mutual friends, and at first, it was just casual hangouts, but now it feels like there's something more. We text almost every day, and he always seems excited to see me when we hang out. He makes me laugh, and I feel comfortable around him, which is a big deal for me.    But here’s the thing: I can’t tell if he feels the same way. Sometimes he flirts with me, but other times he seems a bit distant. He’ll compliment me one day and then act like he’s just being friendly the next. I’ve tried to drop hints about my feelings, but I’m not sure if he’s picking up on them or if he’s just being nice.    I’ve thought about just coming out and asking him how he feels, but I’m terrified of ruining our friendship if he doesn’t feel the same way. I don’t want to put him in an awkward position, and I definitely don’t want to lose what we have.     I guess I’m just feeling confused and frustrated. I really like him, and I wish I could just know if he feels the same. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be appreciated.

__label__1 Starting a writing project can often feel like the hardest part of the process. I find myself staring at a blank page, overwhelmed by the possibilities and paralyzed by the fear of not being good enough. I’d love to hear how you all manage to push through that initial barrier and actually begin writing.    For me, I’ve found a few strategies that help:  1. **Set a Timer**: I’ll set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and tell myself I just need to write something—anything—during that time. It takes the pressure off and often leads to more ideas flowing.  2. **Free Writing**: I’ll sometimes just write whatever comes to mind without worrying about structure or grammar. This helps me get into the flow and can lead to unexpected inspiration.  3. **Outline**: I know some people hate outlines, but I find that having a rough structure can help me feel more secure about where I’m going with my story.  4. **Change of Scenery**: Sometimes, just moving to a different location can spark creativity. Whether it’s a coffee shop, a park, or even just a different room in my house, a new environment can help me focus.    What about you? How do you overcome that initial hurdle and get started on your writing? Any tips or tricks that have worked for you?
__label__1 I've been working on my core strength and trying to improve my vacuum technique, but I've noticed that I have a rib flare when I perform the exercise. It seems like my ribs stick out more than they should, and I'm not sure if this is a common issue or if I'm doing something wrong.    I've read that rib flare can be a sign of tight hip flexors or weak abdominal muscles, but I'm not entirely sure how to address it. I've been focusing on my breathing and trying to engage my core properly, but the rib flare persists.     Has anyone else experienced this? What strategies or exercises have you found helpful in correcting rib flare during vacuums? Any tips on improving my form or strengthening my core would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Alright, fellow degenerates, let’s talk about the Vale call train! 🚂💰    I know some of you hopped on this ride when the stock was sitting pretty at $10, and now it’s been a wild rollercoaster. For those who don’t know, Vale S.A. (VALE) is a Brazilian mining company that’s been making waves lately with its iron ore and nickel production.     So, who’s still holding those calls? I bought a few contracts when the hype started, thinking it was a solid play with the EV boom and all that nickel demand. But man, the volatility has been insane! One day it’s up 10%, the next it’s down 5%.     I’m curious to hear your strategies. Are you holding for the long haul, or are you planning to cash out soon? And what’s your price target? I’m thinking of selling half if it hits $15, but I’m also tempted to ride it out to see if we can hit $20.     Let’s share our thoughts and maybe some memes while we’re at it! 🚀💎🙌
__label__1 I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would love to get your thoughts on this trade in a full point PPR league. I'm being offered a trade where I would give up DeAndre Hopkins and get back Chris Godwin and a 2024 second-round pick.     On one hand, Hopkins has been a consistent performer when healthy, but with the uncertainty around his situation and the emergence of younger receivers, I’m not sure how much longer he’ll be a top option.     On the other hand, Godwin has shown he can be a solid WR2 with upside, especially in a PPR format, and getting a second-round pick could be valuable for future depth.     What do you all think?

__label__1 I’m getting married soon and I’m in a bit of a dilemma about whether or not to invite my colleagues to the wedding. There are only seven of us at work, and we’ve all become really close friends over the years.     On one hand, I feel like it would be nice to include them since we share a strong bond and they’ve been a big part of my life. On the other hand, I worry about the dynamics of mixing work and personal life, and I don’t want anyone to feel obligated to come or to create any awkwardness if someone can’t make it.     What do you all think? Should I invite them, or is it better to keep work and personal life separate? Have any of you faced a similar situation? How did it turn out?

I’ll start with a couple examples:  • breakfast items, Burger King  • chicken fingers, Raising Cane’s

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm on the hunt for a song that I heard recently, but I can't seem to remember the title or the artist. It's been stuck in my head, and I would love your help in identifying it!    Here are some details I remember:  - The genre is a mix of indie pop and electronic.  - The song has a catchy chorus that repeats a lot.  - There’s a prominent use of synths and a bit of a retro vibe.  - I think the lyrics mention something about "chasing dreams" or "running away".    I know it's a long shot, but if anyone has any ideas or can point me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it! Thanks in advance!

__label__0 Hi guys I’m going though a really tough time right now.    I have crohns disease and was put on humira in feb 2022. In April I started having a wide spread Body rash with blisters, head to toe.    It’s much better but still having the rash, my foot skin peeling off, my whole body covered in hyperpigmentation.     My mental health is at an all time low. I’m on stelara now so hopefully not more rashes.    Has anyone had similar stories, im just so sad now my whole body is marked up, I’ve lost all my confidence and am very depressed. I struggle to shower, as I’m scared of the pain of it stinging. I can’t wear certain clothes because it will show my hyperpigmentation and hurts my skin if it’s too tight. How long did it take for some of your marks to go?      Thanks

__label__1 I recently sold some items online and received payment through PayPal. However, I noticed that the payment is on hold, and I can't access the funds until the buyer confirms receipt of the items. This is a bit frustrating because I want to use that money to purchase new inventory for my shop.     I understand that PayPal does this to protect buyers, but it feels unfair to sellers who need to reinvest quickly. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a way to expedite the release of the funds? I’ve heard that providing tracking information can help, but I’m not sure if that’s the only option. Any advice would be appreciated!

It seems like my account has been shadowbanned, but I can't figure out why. I've checked the rules of the subs I frequent, and I haven't violated any guidelines that I know of.     I tried reaching out to the mods of a couple of the subs, but I haven't received any responses. I also checked my account status, and it looks normal, but I can't seem to interact with the community at all.     Has anyone else experienced this? What steps did you take to resolve it? I'm really missing out on engaging with the content and discussions I love. Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been working on my main game project for a while now, and while I'm passionate about it, I can't help but feel a bit burnt out. I've been toying with the idea of starting a side project to keep my creativity flowing and to explore some new ideas that don't quite fit into my main game.     Have any of you started side projects while working on your main game? How did you manage your time between the two? Did it help alleviate burnout or did it end up being more stressful?     I'm also curious about the types of side projects you all have pursued. Were they smaller games, prototypes, or something completely different?     Looking forward to hearing your experiences and any advice you might have!

__label__1 As a Titan main, I’ve been experimenting with various exotics and wanted to share my thoughts on some of the best Titan exotics that often get overshadowed by the One-Eyed Mask and Loreley Splendor Helm. Here are my top picks:    1. **Dunemarchers** - These boots are fantastic for both PvE and PvP. The increased sprint speed and the chain lightning effect on melee hits can really turn the tide in a fight. It’s especially useful in Crucible for closing the gap on opponents.    2. **Heart of Inmost Light** - This chest piece is a powerhouse for ability regeneration. It synergizes well with any build that focuses on using your abilities frequently. The buff to your abilities after using one is a game changer, especially in high-intensity situations.    3. **One-Eyed Mask** - Okay, I know I said I wouldn’t mention it, but hear me out. The ability to track down enemies who’ve damaged you and gain overshield is just too good to ignore. It’s a staple in many PvP loadouts.    4. **Crest of Alpha Lupi** - This exotic is great for team play. The ability to create orbs of light on barricade kills and provide overshields to allies can be a game-changer in raids and Nightfalls. It’s perfect for supporting your fireteam.    5. **Hallowfire Heart** - This is a solid choice for Sunbreaker Titans. The increased ability recharge rate while your super is active can help you maintain a strong presence in both PvE and PvP. Plus, the healing aspect is a nice bonus.    6. **ACD/0 Feedback Fence** - This exotic is perfect for aggressive playstyles. The melee damage return when you get hit can be devastating, especially in close-quarters combat. It’s a fun way to punish enemies who try to rush you.    What are your thoughts? Do you have any other favorites that I missed? Let’s hear your Titan exotic recommendations!

__label__1 The Masters 8 has been an exhilarating ride so far, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the team compositions we've seen in Round 1. Spoilers ahead for those who haven't caught up!    First off, Ash's team is as dynamic as ever. He brought back some of his strongest Pokémon, including Pikachu, of course, but I was pleasantly surprised to see his Gengar and Dragonite make an appearance. It really shows how far Ash has come as a trainer, utilizing his experience with different types and strategies. I think his choice to include Gengar adds a unique twist, especially considering its Ghost-type moves can catch opponents off guard.    On the other hand, Leon's team is just as impressive. Charizard is a staple, but I was really excited to see his Inteleon in action. The synergy between his Pokémon is evident, and it seems like Leon has a solid strategy planned out. The way he uses Inteleon's Snipeshot to control the battlefield is something I think Ash will have to watch out for.    Then we have Cynthia, who brought her iconic Garchomp and Spiritomb. I love how she plays to her strengths, using Garchomp's speed and power to dominate the field. It’s interesting to see how she balances her team with both offensive and defensive strategies, which could be a game-changer in the upcoming rounds.    Overall, the team compositions in Round 1 have set the stage for some intense battles. Each trainer has their own unique style, and I can't wait to see how these matchups unfold. Who do you think has the best team so far, and what strategies do you think will come into play as the Masters 8 progresses? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 Hey everyone. I’m almost 28 weeks pregnant, due around Christmas. Just a little backstory for my situation, I’m a special education teacher at a school with a shortage in our department. They hired two new members for the team, neither of which had much experience, so I’ve been running IEP meetings and doing paperwork for the whole school, on top of planning/teaching for my own caseload. It’s been a stressful couple of weeks, but I’ve been managing.     Last week one of my team members suddenly quit. There’s a shortage of subs in my area as well, so my principal decided to split that persons schedule between myself and the other team member. She took away some of my push in services, gave me more pullout services as well as taking away the few breaks I had which I used to do paperwork. I still have a lunch and was told my planning could be before or after school during our contracted hours.     Looking at it closer - my caseload and planning is going to double, I’ll have multiple students with behaviors, and 75+ weekly IEP goals to take data on. I literally (and embarrassingly) burst into tears during this meeting because of how overwhelmed I already felt and that night my stomach felt very tight with a lot of pressure.     Idk what I’m looking for here lol commiseration? Advice? Just venting? Anyone who’s been in the same boat? I’m just worried about baby and what this level of stress is going to do. My husband makes decent money and we’d be ok without this job, I was going to take off the rest of the school year after birth anyway. But I really like the kids and I don’t want to leave anyone worse off by leaving!    If you read this far thank you, I feel better getting it off my chest! 🤍

__label__1 I took Plan B about a week ago after a contraceptive failure, and I’m starting to worry about how it might affect my next period. I’ve read that it can cause some changes in your cycle, but I’m curious about how it might specifically impact the timing and flow of my next period.     In the past, I’ve had pretty regular cycles, so I’m a bit anxious about what to expect. Has anyone else experienced changes in their period after taking Plan B? Did it come earlier or later than usual, and was the flow different? Any insights or experiences would be really helpful!

(She never whines or barks before throwing up, though)
__label__1 I’m currently working on a project that involves a shaft supported at two ends, and my coworker and I have been debating the merits of using a symmetric versus an asymmetric cable drive system.     From my perspective, a symmetric cable drive offers better load distribution across the shaft, which can help minimize bending moments and reduce the risk of failure due to uneven loading. This configuration also tends to provide more stability and can be easier to tune for consistent performance, especially in applications where precision is key.    On the other hand, my coworker argues that an asymmetric cable drive can be advantageous in terms of space efficiency and weight reduction. He believes that by strategically placing the cables, we can achieve the desired torque while minimizing the overall footprint of the system. However, I’m concerned that this could lead to uneven stress distribution and potentially compromise the integrity of the shaft over time.    I’d love to hear from others in the engineering community about their experiences with symmetric vs. asymmetric cable drives. What factors did you consider when making your choice? Are there specific applications where one clearly outperforms the other? Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of discussions lately about clothing packs and whether using them can lead to bans in GTA Online. I know that Rockstar has a pretty strict policy when it comes to cheating and exploiting, but what about just using custom clothing packs?     From what I understand, if the clothing pack is purely cosmetic and doesn't give you any unfair advantages, it shouldn't be a problem. However, I've heard some horror stories about players getting banned for using mods that alter gameplay or give them an edge in missions or PvP.     Has anyone here had any experience with this? Are there specific clothing packs that are known to be safe, or should we just stick to the in-game options? I really want to customize my character without risking my account.

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I wanted to share some interesting information I came across regarding the synthesis of MDMA, particularly in relation to the work being done by MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies). Recently, I read about how MDMA can be synthesized from crude oil, which is quite fascinating and a bit surprising to me.    For those who might not know, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a synthetic drug that has been used recreationally and is also being researched for therapeutic uses, especially in treating PTSD. The traditional synthesis of MDMA involves several chemical precursors, but the idea of using crude oil as a starting point is a newer development that could potentially make the production process more efficient.    The process involves breaking down the hydrocarbons found in crude oil into simpler compounds, which can then be chemically transformed into the precursors needed for MDMA. This method could not only streamline the production but also reduce the reliance on more traditional and sometimes harder-to-source materials.     I find it intriguing how the chemistry behind MDMA is evolving, especially as we see a growing interest in its therapeutic potential. MAPS has been at the forefront of this research, advocating for the medical use of MDMA and working towards its legalization for therapeutic purposes. The implications of being able to synthesize MDMA from crude oil could mean more accessible production methods in the future, which is exciting for both researchers and patients alike.    Of course, this raises questions about the safety and regulation of such production methods. As we know, the purity and quality of MDMA can vary significantly, and ensuring that any synthesized product is safe for consumption is paramount. It’s essential that any advancements in synthesis are accompanied by rigorous testing and quality control.    I’d love to hear your thoughts on this! Have any of you come across similar information or have insights into the implications of synthesizing MDMA from crude oil? What do you think about the future of MDMA research and its potential therapeutic uses?     Looking forward to your responses!
__label__1 I just wanted to share a little bit about my journey and how I’ve come to embrace my identity. Growing up, I always felt a bit out of place. I didn’t quite fit into the boxes that society had laid out for me. I tried to conform, but it never felt right.     After years of confusion and self-doubt, I finally started to explore my sexuality and gender identity. It wasn’t easy, and I faced a lot of challenges along the way. I dealt with rejection from friends and family, and there were times when I felt completely alone. But through it all, I learned to be honest with myself.     I’ve come to realize that it’s okay to not have everything figured out. It’s okay to take my time in understanding who I am. I’ve found a community that accepts me for who I am, and that has made all the difference.     So, while it may not seem like much, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I’m learning to love myself and to be honest about my experiences. It’s not always easy, but it’s honest work, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.     If you’re on a similar journey, just know that you’re not alone. It’s okay to take your time, and it’s okay to be honest with yourself. We’re all figuring it out together.
__label__1 I’m in a bit of a meal planning rut and could really use some help! With two little ones at home, I find it challenging to come up with quick, healthy meals that everyone will actually eat. I want to avoid the dreaded dinner-time battles and keep things simple but nutritious.    Here’s what I’m working with:  - A 4-year-old who loves pasta and cheese but is a bit picky about veggies.  - A 2-year-old who will eat almost anything but has a tendency to throw food on the floor if he’s not in the mood.  - A busy schedule with work and activities, so I need meals that can be prepped in advance or cooked quickly.    I’m thinking of doing a mix of batch cooking and easy weeknight meals. Here are some ideas I’ve come up with:  1. **Pasta Primavera** - I can sneak in some veggies like bell peppers and zucchini, and toss it with olive oil and parmesan.  2. **Taco Night** - Ground turkey or beef with all the fixings. I can set up a taco bar and let the kids build their own.  3. **Sheet Pan Chicken and Veggies** - Just throw everything on a pan and roast it. Easy clean-up!  4. **Breakfast for Dinner** - Scrambled eggs, whole grain toast, and fruit. It’s quick and the kids love it.  5. **Homemade Pizza** - Use store-bought dough and let the kids add their own toppings. It’s fun and interactive!    I’d love to hear your go-to meals or any tips for making meal prep easier. How do you keep your little ones happy at the dinner table? Any favorite recipes or hacks would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for five years. Lately, our relationship has been strained due to his increasing emotional distance and lack of communication. He has been spending more time with his friends and less time at home, which has left me feeling neglected and unappreciated.     A few weeks ago, after a particularly rough week where he forgot my birthday and didn’t even acknowledge it, I confronted him about how I was feeling. Instead of having a mature conversation, he got defensive and accused me of being overly dramatic. This led to a huge argument where I expressed that I felt like I was living with a roommate rather than a partner.     In a moment of frustration, I told him that I needed space and that he should leave the house for a while to think about what he wants. He reluctantly agreed and moved in with a friend. Since then, I’ve had time to reflect on our relationship and what I want moving forward.     However, I’ve also been feeling really hurt and angry about how he has treated me. I’ve been considering telling his family about the situation, as they have always been supportive of our marriage and I think they would want to know what’s going on. I’m worried that this might escalate things further and create more drama, but I also feel like they deserve to know how their son is treating his wife.     So, AITA for kicking my husband out of the house? And WIBTA if I told his family about our issues?

__label__1 I recently started my first batch of mead and I'm getting ready to transfer it from the fermentation bucket to a carboy for secondary fermentation. I wanted to share my process and see if anyone has any tips or advice to ensure a smooth transfer and avoid any issues.    Here’s my plan:    1. **Sanitize Everything**: I’ll start by thoroughly sanitizing my carboy, racking cane, and any other equipment I’ll be using. I’m using a Star San solution for this, as I’ve heard it’s effective and easy to use.    2. **Prepare the Carboy**: I’ll make sure the carboy is clean and ready to go. I’ll also have a stopper and airlock ready to seal it after the transfer.    3. **Set Up for Racking**: I’ll place the fermentation bucket on a higher surface (like a kitchen counter) and the carboy on a lower surface (like the floor) to allow gravity to do the work. I’ll attach the racking cane to the siphon and place it in the bucket, making sure it’s above the sediment at the bottom.    4. **Start the Siphon**: I’ll start the siphoning process by either using the suction method or a pump if I have one. I want to make sure I don’t disturb the sediment too much, as I’ve read that can lead to off-flavors.    5. **Monitor the Transfer**: As the mead flows into the carboy, I’ll keep an eye on the level in the bucket to ensure I don’t accidentally siphon too much sediment. I plan to stop the transfer when I see the sediment starting to rise in the bucket.    6. **Seal the Carboy**: Once the transfer is complete, I’ll seal the carboy with the stopper and airlock. I’ll make sure to check for any leaks around the stopper to ensure a good seal.    7. **Label the Carboy**: I’ll label the carboy with the date and any other relevant information (like the type of mead and starting gravity) so I can keep track of it during the aging process.    8. **Store in a Dark Place**: Finally, I’ll store the carboy in a cool, dark place to allow it to age properly.    I’m a bit nervous about the transfer, especially with the potential for oxidation or contamination, so any tips or advice from more experienced mead makers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

They even quote scriptures to back this up. And yet they say it is necessary to isolate individuals from the congregation (and they are therefore shunned by the community and their families).  Awake!

__label__1 Imagine having the power to ask for any amount of money at any time, but with a catch: for every dollar you request, your risk of dying from gonorrhea increases by 0.01%.     At first, it sounds like a dream come true. Need a new car? Just ask for $20,000! But wait, that’s a 200% increase in your risk of a painful and embarrassing death.     You start to weigh your options. Do you really need that new gaming console? Is it worth the potential 0.01% increase in your gonorrhea death risk?     You find yourself in awkward situations, like at a restaurant, trying to decide if you should ask for the check to be split or just pay for the whole meal. "Hey, can I get $50 for this burger?" Oh no, that’s a 0.5% increase!     And don’t even get me started on the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. "Hey, can I borrow $100?" Suddenly, you’re calculating your risk of dying from a sexually transmitted infection instead of just enjoying a night out.     In the end, you become a master of budgeting and risk assessment, but at what cost? You’re constantly paranoid about your health, and every dollar feels like a gamble with your life.     So, while you can ask for any amount of money at any time, you might just end up broke and terrified of gonorrhea instead.
__label__0 Been on here a bit now and can’t thank folks enough.     Still trying to solve this and will spare the long story. I have daily testicle sensitivity on both sides and slight swelling on mostly the left now. I am pretty sure its CPPS but not sure yet.     Anyway, I noticed that these symptoms appear in the morning and last the day on bad days. I am wondering if its tied to my morning routine or if its just muscles clenching since I am awake.    Routine is generally taking a leak and grabbing some coffee then starting my work day (desk work).     Thanks,

__label__0 [Here's the flute drop remade by me from memory](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ai43R0g-qstggglaoz3uOy5ix7i1)    The male singer sounds like Ed Sheeran, but I checked his songs and he doesn't have it.    I heard this song in a store today and it kinda stuck with me despite not being a pop fan. The rest of the song by my memory is just Not Ed Sheeran playing guitar and singing slowly.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just finished writing Part 10 of my Danganronpa fanfic, "Himiko's Mansion," and I’m super excited to share it with you all! In this chapter, the characters finally wrap up their exploration of the third floor of the mansion, and things are getting intense!    As they delve deeper, they uncover some dark secrets about the mansion's past and face some unexpected challenges. I tried to incorporate a lot of suspense and character development, especially focusing on Himiko and her interactions with the others.     There’s a scene where she has to confront her fears and use her magic in a way she never has before, which I think really showcases her growth as a character. Plus, there are some fun interactions with Kokichi and Maki that I hope you all will enjoy!    I’d love to hear your thoughts on this chapter! Did you enjoy the twists? Any predictions for what might happen next? Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it! Here’s the link to the chapter: [insert link here]      Let’s discuss!      #Danganronpa #Fanfic #HimikosMansion #Part10
__label__1 I (24F) recently started dating someone (26M) I met through mutual friends. Things have been going really well, and we’ve been spending a lot of time together. However, I noticed that he has a pretty active social media presence, and I found myself looking at his profiles more than I probably should.     I’ve seen some posts from his past relationships and noticed he still has pictures of them up, which made me feel a bit insecure. I also found myself checking his friends' profiles to see if they post about him or if he’s hanging out with them. I know this isn’t healthy behavior, and I don’t want to come off as controlling or invasive.     I’m trying to figure out if this is just normal curiosity or if I’m crossing a line into stalker territory. I haven’t mentioned any of this to him because I don’t want to seem paranoid or make him uncomfortable.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do I manage these feelings without it becoming an obsession? Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been getting into manga recently and I'm curious about how everyone else reads it. Do you prefer physical copies or digital versions?     For me, I started with digital because it’s more convenient and I can access a wider range of titles without having to hunt down physical copies. I use a couple of apps that have a good selection, but I sometimes miss the feel of holding a book in my hands.     I’ve also noticed that some people really enjoy collecting physical volumes and displaying them on their shelves. It seems like a great way to support the creators and have a tangible piece of the story.     What about you all? Do you have any recommendations for where to read or buy manga? And do you think one format is better than the other? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been struggling with binge eating for a long time, and recently I've noticed a shift in my coping mechanisms. Instead of turning to food, I've found myself binge shopping. At first, it felt like a great distraction and a way to fill the void that binge eating used to occupy. I would buy clothes, gadgets, and even things I didn't need, just to get that rush of excitement.    However, now I'm starting to realize that this isn't a healthy coping strategy either. My bank account is suffering, and I often feel guilty about the things I've bought. I still have that same urge to escape my feelings, but now it's manifesting in a different way.     Has anyone else experienced this? How did you manage the transition? Did you find healthier ways to cope, or did you end up addressing the underlying issues that led to both binge eating and binge shopping? I could really use some advice or support right now.
__label__0 I read and loved it, I am searching for anything that has the same type of strong friend group which is just like family type of thing.
__label__1 I’ve been reflecting on my experiences lately, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m stuck in a vicious cycle. It seems like every time I start to feel a little better, something triggers me, and I spiral back down into that dark place.     I know I have BPD, and I’ve been working on my coping strategies, but it feels like every step forward is met with two steps back. I try to engage in self-care, reach out to friends, and practice mindfulness, but when the emotional storms hit, it’s like all of that goes out the window.     I often find myself feeling empty and disconnected, and then I react impulsively, which only leads to more regret and shame. It’s exhausting. I want to break this cycle, but I don’t know how.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you manage to pull yourself out of these cycles? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips you might have.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm new to the world of RC cars, and I've recently developed a keen interest in nitro-powered models. I have a few questions about specific cars and what to look for as a beginner.    1. **Best Starter Nitro Car**: What would you recommend as a good entry-level nitro car? I’m looking for something that’s durable and easy to maintain, as I’m still learning the ropes.    2. **Maintenance Tips**: I’ve heard that nitro engines require a bit more maintenance than electric ones. What are some essential maintenance tips I should keep in mind to keep my car running smoothly?    3. **Fuel Recommendations**: What type of nitro fuel should I start with? I’ve seen different percentages available, and I’m not sure what’s best for a beginner.    4. **Upgrades**: Once I get the hang of things, what are some common upgrades that can enhance performance without breaking the bank?    5. **Community Events**: Are there any local clubs or events for nitro RC cars that you would recommend? I’d love to connect with other enthusiasts and learn from their experiences.    Thanks in advance for your help! I’m excited to dive into this hobby and appreciate any advice you can share!
__label__1 I recently started the process of applying for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) using Form W-7, and I have a few questions that I hope someone here can help me with.    1. **Supporting Documentation**: I understand that I need to provide original documents or certified copies to prove my identity and foreign status. Can anyone clarify what types of documents are acceptable? I have a passport, but do I need to include anything else?    2. **Filing Status**: I’m unsure about how to indicate my filing status on the form. I’m applying for an ITIN because I’m a non-resident alien and need it for tax purposes. Should I select ‘Single’ or is there a different option that applies to my situation?    3. **Processing Time**: How long does it typically take to receive the ITIN after submitting Form W-7? I’ve heard varying reports, and I’m trying to plan accordingly since I need it for my tax return.    4. **Where to Send the Form**: I’ve seen different instructions online about where to send the completed Form W-7. Should I send it to the address listed on the form, or is there a specific IRS office that handles ITIN applications?    5. **Renewal of ITIN**: If I already have an ITIN but it has expired, do I need to fill out a new Form W-7, or is there a different process for renewing it?    Any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been debating whether to pick up the 98 or 99 version of Gordie Howe for my HUT team. Both cards look incredible on paper, but I'm curious about how they perform in-game.     The 98 Howe has solid stats across the board, with great skating and shooting attributes, while the 99 version obviously has that extra edge with maxed-out stats. However, the price difference is significant, and I'm wondering if the 99 is really worth it.     For those who have used both, how do they compare in terms of gameplay? Is the 99 Howe a game-changer, or can the 98 hold its own? Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for as long as I can remember, and sometimes music is the only thing that helps me feel understood. I wanted to share some songs that really resonate with me and capture the feelings of anxiety and isolation.     1. **"Numb" by Linkin Park** - This song perfectly encapsulates that feeling of being overwhelmed and not being able to meet expectations, whether they’re from yourself or others.     2. **"Creep" by Radiohead** - The lyrics express that deep sense of not fitting in and feeling like an outsider, which is something I think a lot of us can relate to.     3. **"Anxiety" by Julia Michaels** - This song is all about the struggles of living with anxiety and how it can affect relationships. It’s so relatable and makes me feel less alone.     4. **"Breathe Me" by Sia** - The haunting melody and lyrics about feeling lost and needing help really hit home for me. It’s a reminder that it’s okay to ask for support.     5. **"Stressed Out" by Twenty One Pilots** - This song captures the pressure of adulthood and the longing for simpler times, which can be really relatable for those of us dealing with anxiety.     6. **"I’m Not the Only One" by Sam Smith** - While it’s about heartbreak, the feelings of inadequacy and loneliness in this song resonate with my social anxiety.     7. **"Help!" by The Beatles** - A classic that expresses the need for help and support, which is something I often feel when my anxiety gets overwhelming.     I’d love to hear what songs you all relate to when it comes to social anxiety. Music can be such a powerful way to cope and connect, even if it’s just through shared experiences. What are your go-to tracks?
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m a total Broadway newbie and I’m looking to dive into the world of musical theater. I’ve heard so much about the magic of Broadway, but I’m not sure where to start when it comes to listening to cast recordings.     What are some of the best albums that you would recommend for someone just starting out? I’m open to all genres and styles, whether it’s classic shows or contemporary hits.     I’ve heard a lot about "Hamilton" and "Wicked," but I’d love to get your thoughts on other must-listen albums that really capture the essence of Broadway. Any hidden gems or personal favorites?     Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
__label__0 I am an addict  I’m addicted to many things, them being pornography and masturbating, and marijuana and I need to get this out.  My addictions have ruined my life and are ruining my life. The shame, and the loneliness that I feel and the feeling of being isolated from everyone that I come across because of the shame I carry because of these addictions is unbearable. It started off with feeling ashamed, because I felt that I let myself and my family down, dropping out of college and not being able to finish and getting back in those feelings of shame, combined with, at the time, an addiction to alcohol and partying and having lots of people around me, Allowed me to ignore that shame and not really address it and just fix the problem. I didn’t listen to anyone I just wanted to party and hang out with my friends to get drunk to mess around with girls to go to clubs but deep down the shame, I felt from believing that I didn’t have anything really going on for myself, I was a college dropout working at a shoe department, and I had no plan, no real plan as to how I was going to better my life so the shame grew inside of me, and it caused me to be apprehensive in approaching women that I was attracted to. I I felt ashamed and like “you know what I don’t have anything really going on for myself she’s not gonna be interested in me.” “I’m not gonna waste her or my time”, really just talking myself out of a potential friendly encounter with someone new. So the desire to engage with new women was not being met because of my shame, so it led me to seek them out through social media, and through apps like Instagram. I found myself following all the Instagram model type women on there whether they were famous or not they had that look… which would lead you to look at  their only fans page,  then that led to searching them on back market apps, deep web apps. Which then leads to finding their sex tapes and their pornography, which leads to fulfilling that absence of sexual human encounter with masturbating through pornography. You then feel that dopamine rush that ordinarily would come from the feeling of reward or accomplishment by your sexual human encounter with someone that you care about or that you’re dating, that you like. But because you achieved that feeling artificially, you know by satisfying yourself, it just creates more feelings of shame. to cope with those feelings of shame you use marijuana to help numb you to those feelings, which also gives you a dopamine hit.   You continue this process for 10 years.   In that time you father three children by one woman whom you were married to, but you’re struggling addiction, Correction, you’re struggling to function while hiding your addiction creates a rift in your marriage because she catches you masturbating in the shower to pornography on Mother’s Day. Also, while attempting to hide your addiction, you can’t hold down a job where you have to be any sense of responsible, responsible to arriving on time mostly. But also, you would only apply for certain types of jobs that don’t require you to submit a drug test because you know you’re going to smoke some weed. That limits your access to higher, paying better quality jobs because they require you to submit a drug test. So this creates even more struggle and tension in the marriage and relationship which leads ultimately to a divorce. A broken home and family. I no longer want to be an addict. I no longer want to be a slave to my addictions I no longer want to spend money I need to save on munchies and backwoods from the gas station. On $30 bags of weed, on gas driving 30 miles to the nearest weed man. I could be saving all of that money. I should be saving all of that money.   Once you’re aware of the addiction that you’re struggling with what are the next steps? are you in the process of changing your life by getting these words out? by writing, is this a part of recovering from your addiction? I hope so, and to whom ever reads this, please help I’m losing everything right in front of my eyes.

__label__1 I’ve been in therapy for a while now, but I still struggle with opening up to my therapist. I find myself holding back a lot, and I worry that my anxieties and thoughts might be considered weird or irrational. It’s like there’s this barrier that I can’t seem to break through, and I often feel embarrassed about what I want to share.     I know that therapists are trained to handle all sorts of issues, but I can’t shake the feeling that my concerns might be too strange or that I’ll be judged for them. I want to be honest and get the help I need, but I’m afraid of how my therapist might react.     Has anyone else experienced this? How did you manage to open up more in therapy? Any tips on how to overcome this fear of judgment? I really want to make progress, but I feel stuck.
__label__0 So I recently started a travel vlog, and I was thinking of ways to increase my viewership, and I thought it might be a good idea to do shorts as a way to advertise it.    Something along the lines of "Hey there, my new channel is about travel and this coming Friday I will be uploading a video where I travel to this place" (show short clips from the video.)  "If you are interested in seeing the trip, make sure you are subscribed."    Now, while I think this would be a good idea, but my worry is it annoying people who are already subscribed to me.  Personally, when I go to a channel, I think it looks kind of tacky to see it full of shorts, and I don't want to bombard people's subscription boxes with shorts as well.    Is there a way to upload shorts and have them viewable in the shorts algorithm but not have it viewable on the channel?
__label__1 I was at the Western Fair yesterday and noticed a group of people protesting outside the entrance. It seemed to be related to animal rights, as they were holding signs and chanting about the treatment of animals in fairs and exhibitions. I couldn't catch all the details, but it looked like they were advocating for better conditions for animals used in shows and rides.     Has anyone else seen this? What do you think about the protests? I understand the importance of animal welfare, but I also enjoy the fair experience. It’s a complex issue for sure. Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__0 So me and my girlfriend met when she was 17 and I was 18 when she first came into my dads house 3 years ago they didn’t really hit it off or speak my dad is quite blunt and my girlfriend the first sign of dis interest she gets she shys away baring in mind she was 17 as the years went on my dads side of the family have grown a dislike to her due to her apparently making him feel uncomfortable with her lack of effort in his house and her and my sister having arguments that were blew out of proportion so as the years have went on it’s boiled down to her not being welcome in my dads house and none of my family wanting to be In her company from my dads side anyway, she recently moved across the street into a house with her friend and I felt like I should have the talk with my dad about if she will ever be welcomed or a second chance could be gave baring in mind a lot of serious issues have happened, he says no he would feel like a mug if he invited her back in and going against what he stands for and that he will be civil for my sake if he sees her at and event etc but she won’t be welcome in his house and he doesn’t want to build a relationship with her, same with my sister is this a massive obstacle to the point where it could make us not work long term and it’s only a matter of time before it ends or does it really not matter?
__label__0 I feel like there’s not a lot of talk about ophthalmology in the uk on the internet (correct me if I SM wrong)   I want to create a thread where ophthalmology trainees (and potentially consultants) come and talk about ophthalmology as a field, it’s work-life balance, the private practice opportunities, its competitiveness, it’s potential monotony and general facts about the field.
__label__0 Hi all,     I will soon be starting a role with a company car. My question is around if I will be charged 20% BIK or 40% BIK.

__label__1 I've been on Vraylar (3.5mg) for about a year now to manage my bipolar disorder, and while it has helped stabilize my mood, I've started to notice some concerning symptoms that I suspect might be tardive dyskinesia (TD).     Initially, I thought it was just stress or anxiety, but I've been experiencing involuntary movements, particularly in my face and hands. Sometimes my tongue feels like it’s moving on its own, and I catch myself making weird facial expressions without realizing it. It’s really unsettling, and I’m worried about what this could mean for my long-term health.    I’ve read that TD can be a side effect of antipsychotics, and I’m wondering if anyone else here has experienced similar symptoms while on Vraylar or other medications. How did you handle it? Did you talk to your doctor about it, and what steps did you take?     I’m hesitant to change my medication because I’ve finally found something that works for my mood, but I also don’t want to ignore these symptoms. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been considering getting a pair of wireless headphones, but I want to make sure that I won't be sacrificing sound quality. I know many wireless models come with a wired option, and I'm curious if using that wired connection can deliver sound quality that is on par with dedicated wired headphones.    Specifically, I'm looking at models like the Sony WH-1000XM5 and the Bose 700, which both have a wired option. If I were to use the wired connection, would I still experience the same level of detail, clarity, and overall sound quality as I would with a good pair of wired headphones in the same price range?     Additionally, are there any specific models that you would recommend that excel in both wired and wireless modes? I primarily listen to a mix of genres, including classical, rock, and electronic, so I want something versatile.     Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about how to approach my therapist about my gender identity and my desire to transition. It's been a journey for me, and I want to make sure I communicate my feelings clearly and honestly.     I guess I'm feeling a bit anxious about it. I know that therapy is a safe space, but I worry about how my therapist will react. What if they don't understand? What if they don't take me seriously?     I want to express how important this is to me and how it affects my mental health. I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection and I feel like I’m finally ready to embrace my true self.     For those of you who have been in a similar situation, how did you approach the conversation? Did you prepare anything in advance? Any tips on how to make it easier? I really want to make the most of my therapy sessions and get the support I need.     Thanks in advance for your advice!
__label__1 I definitely do! Sometimes when I'm out shopping for a batch, I find myself craving a little pick-me-up, especially if it's been a long day or if I'm feeling a bit sluggish. I usually grab a soda or a candy bar from the store I'm shopping at. It feels like a small reward for all the hard work we put in, and honestly, it helps keep my energy up while I’m running around.     I try to keep it reasonable though, like I won’t go overboard and buy a bunch of snacks. Just one little treat to keep me motivated! Plus, I think it’s nice to enjoy a little something while I’m working. Anyone else do this? What’s your go-to snack or drink while you’re out shopping?
__label__1 I've been doing a lot of research on supplements to improve egg quality, and I came across some studies suggesting that melatonin might be beneficial during the IVF process, especially in the month leading up to egg retrieval. I’m currently preparing for my next cycle and considering adding melatonin to my supplement regimen.     I’ve read that melatonin can help with oxidative stress and may improve oocyte quality, which is something I’m really focused on since I’ve had some challenges in the past.     Has anyone here added melatonin to their supplement cocktail during the egg retrieval month? If so, what dosage did you use, and did you notice any positive effects? I’d love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have!     Thanks in advance!
__label__0 what’s your opinion on a relationship that is 2 grades apart, but legal? do you think that with the right intentions its okay?
__label__1 I’m in a 12-team PPR league and just completed a trade that has me questioning whether I made the right move. Here’s the breakdown:    **My Side:**    - DeAndre Hopkins (WR)    - David Montgomery (RB)      **Their Side:**    - A.J. Brown (WR)    - Kenneth Gainwell (RB)      I was looking to upgrade my WR position, and I felt like A.J. Brown has a higher ceiling than Hopkins, especially with the way the Eagles' offense has been performing. Montgomery has been solid, but I’m a bit worried about his workload with the Bears' backfield situation. Gainwell is more of a depth piece for me, but he could have some value if Sanders continues to struggle.    What do you all think? Did I give up too much for Brown, or did I make a smart move? Who do you think wins this trade in the long run?
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I'm looking for some advice on automating the employee lifecycle using G Suite tools. Our organization is looking to streamline processes from onboarding to offboarding, and I believe that leveraging Google Apps Script and other G Suite features could be the key.    Here’s a brief overview of what we’re aiming to achieve:    1. **Onboarding**: Automate the creation of user accounts in Google Workspace, set up email aliases, and provision access to necessary Google Drive folders and shared resources. Ideally, I’d like to send a welcome email with all the essential information and links to resources.    2. **Training**: Set up a system to track training sessions and completion. I’m considering using Google Forms to collect training feedback and completion status, which can then be compiled into a Google Sheet for easy tracking.    3. **Performance Reviews**: Automate reminders for performance review cycles and collect feedback through Google Forms. I’d like to generate summary reports in Google Docs or Sheets to make it easier for managers to review.    4. **Offboarding**: Create a checklist for offboarding that includes revoking access to accounts, archiving emails, and collecting company property. I want to ensure that all steps are followed and documented.    I’m particularly interested in hearing about any scripts or workflows that others have implemented successfully. If you have any resources, templates, or tips on how to get started with Google Apps Script for these processes, I would greatly appreciate it!    Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__0 I have been kicked out of the house 2 and a half times (third time no follow through). But I’ve come back to live with my parents after college because it was financially wise, I’d just broken off a 5 year relationship (turned engagement) with a narcissist and my dad was diagnosed with dementia (he is not the narcissist). It is really hard being back at home - we fight often over petty things that she uses to tear me down about. I sit in my room and sob, while she acts completely unaffected and laughs at a movie that is on. I want to go no contact but she has told me she will keep me from seeing Dad - and these years are the best of what he has left. I’m feeling trapped and like I’m losing my mind - she tells me I said or did things that I didn’t or retells stories from my childhood differently - trying to convince me I have something seriously wrong with my memory. And my dad can not back me up because he literally cannot remember! I am exhausted and feel like giving up. She sucks up all my joy for herself and I’m left feeling empty and used. I have a really hard time making friends because of the attachment style I learned from her - I over share too soon and cut them off before I think they’ll reject me. This combined with the pandemic, combined with breaking off my engagement has literally left me with zero support system except her and dad. And she knows it.   I’ve come here because I feel like I am at my breaking point. I’m trying to pay a therapist $100 a week but often I can’t manage it. Any encouragement, support resources you could offer would mean so much. One more thing that is adding to the complexity of this situation… she admitted to me recently that she is having an affair and has had multiple before this one and that my father was a horrible husband and treated her poorly. Further trying to narrow my support system to only her.   Sorry that was so much. Thanks for listening.
__label__1 Today was a day of growth for me, and I wanted to share two important lessons I learned that I believe can resonate with many of you on your self-improvement journeys.    **1. Embrace Discomfort**    This morning, I had a meeting that I was dreading. I knew it would involve discussing some tough feedback I had received recently. My instinct was to avoid it, to push it off, or to downplay its importance. But I decided to lean into the discomfort instead. I prepared myself mentally, reminded myself that growth often comes from facing challenges head-on, and went into the meeting with an open mind.     What I discovered was that the conversation was not nearly as painful as I had anticipated. In fact, it turned out to be a constructive dialogue that helped me understand my weaknesses better and provided me with actionable steps to improve. Embracing discomfort can lead to unexpected growth and clarity.     **2. Celebrate Small Wins**    Later in the day, I completed a project that I had been working on for weeks. It was a significant task, and I was tempted to just move on to the next thing without taking a moment to acknowledge my effort. But instead, I took a few minutes to reflect on what I had accomplished. I wrote down the steps I took, the challenges I overcame, and how I felt about the outcome.     Celebrating small wins is crucial for maintaining motivation and building confidence. It reminds us that progress is made up of many small steps, and each one deserves recognition.     In summary, today taught me the value of embracing discomfort and celebrating small victories. Both lessons are essential for personal growth and can help us navigate the ups and downs of our self-improvement journeys. I hope these insights inspire you to reflect on your own experiences and find ways to apply them in your life!
__label__1 I've been working on a mob farm that utilizes both a skeleton spawner and a cave spider spawner, and I'm curious about how their proximity affects spawn rates.     From what I understand, each spawner has its own spawn area, and they can spawn mobs independently. However, if they are too close together, could the spawn rates of one affect the other? For example, if I have a skeleton spawn nearby, will it reduce the number of cave spiders that spawn, or vice versa?     I want to optimize my farm for maximum efficiency, so any insights or experiences you all have would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just wanted to remind everyone that the VA disability payments for October are scheduled to be deposited on the first business day of the month, which is typically the 1st unless it falls on a weekend or holiday. This month, the payment should arrive on October 2nd.     If you haven't received your payment by then, make sure to check your bank account and also your VA account online for any updates. If there are any issues, you can contact the VA directly or visit your local VA office for assistance.     Also, if you have any questions about your benefits or changes in your disability rating, now is a good time to reach out to a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) who can help guide you through the process.     Stay strong, and thank you for your service!
__label__0 Please don’t judge me, haha. I’ve been wanting to go to a hardstyle show forever.     Does anyone know of any upcoming shows or places that play that type of music?
__label__1 I’m trying to remember the name of a game I played a while back, and it’s driving me crazy! It was a 2D platformer where you controlled a little character who could jump and run through various levels. The art style was very colorful and had a cartoonish vibe.     One of the main mechanics I remember is that you could collect different power-ups that would change your abilities, like a double jump or a speed boost. There were also some levels that had a time limit, which added a bit of pressure to complete them quickly.     I think there were boss fights at the end of some levels, and the music was really catchy and upbeat. I played it on PC, but I’m not sure if it was exclusive to that platform.     If anyone has any idea what this game might be, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!

__label__1 Imagine if every president had their internet search history archived for public viewing. It would not only provide insight into their decision-making processes but also reveal their personal interests, concerns, and the information they sought out during their time in office.     On one hand, it could promote transparency and accountability, showing the public what resources and information influenced their policies. On the other hand, it raises questions about privacy and the potential for misinterpretation of innocent searches.     But in a world where we demand accountability from our leaders, perhaps knowing what they were curious about or worried about could help us understand their actions better. It’s a strange thought that the most powerful people in the world might have their most mundane online queries scrutinized by the public.

__label__1 I wanted to share my journey of what I like to call "the death of the self" and how it has led to a profound transformation in my life.    For a long time, I was trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, anxiety, and the constant need for validation from others. I was living for the approval of friends, family, and social media, and it was exhausting. I felt like I was wearing a mask, pretending to be someone I thought I should be rather than embracing who I truly am.    About six months ago, I hit a breaking point. I was overwhelmed with stress and felt completely lost. It was during this time that I stumbled upon the concept of ego death, which is essentially the idea of letting go of the self that is tied to societal expectations and external validation. I realized that I needed to let go of the person I thought I was supposed to be and embrace the person I truly am.    I started by practicing mindfulness and meditation. At first, it was challenging to quiet my mind, but over time, I learned to observe my thoughts without judgment. I began to understand that my thoughts do not define me; they are just passing clouds in the vast sky of my consciousness. This realization was liberating.    I also took a hard look at my relationships. I distanced myself from toxic friendships that drained my energy and surrounded myself with people who uplifted and inspired me. I learned to communicate my needs and set boundaries, which was a game-changer for my mental health.    As I continued this journey, I began to explore my passions without the fear of judgment. I started painting again, something I loved as a child but had abandoned in pursuit of more "practical" endeavors. I found joy in creating art for the sake of creating, not for the approval of others. This rekindled passion helped me reconnect with my authentic self.    The death of the self was not easy; it required me to confront my fears and insecurities. But through this process, I discovered a sense of freedom and peace that I had never experienced before. I learned to love myself unconditionally and to accept my flaws as part of my unique journey.    Today, I feel more aligned with my true self than ever. I no longer seek validation from others, and I am learning to trust my intuition. I still have moments of doubt, but I now have the tools to navigate those feelings without letting them consume me.    If you find yourself feeling lost or overwhelmed, I encourage you to explore the idea of letting go of the self that no longer serves you. It can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey. Remember, you are not alone, and it’s okay to seek help along the way. Embrace the process, and you might just find a version of yourself that you never knew existed.

__label__1 I’m currently seeing a counselor at my college, and I’ve been discussing some personal issues, including experiences of abuse and domestic violence that I’ve faced in the past and that still occur occasionally. I’m feeling really confused and anxious about what I share with my counselor, especially regarding the potential for them to report my situation.    I understand that many counselors have a duty to report certain things, but I’m not sure how it works when the abuse is ongoing but I’m not in immediate danger at the moment. Would my counselor be required to report this to authorities or the school if I disclose that the abuse is still happening? I want to be honest and get the help I need, but I’m also scared of the consequences of sharing too much.     Can anyone provide clarity on what the reporting requirements might be in this situation? I really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.

__label__1 A sinusoidal field refers to a type of electromagnetic field that varies sinusoidally with time and/or space. This means that the field can be described by a sine or cosine function, which is characterized by its smooth, periodic oscillations. Sinusoidal fields are fundamental in physics, particularly in the study of waves and oscillations.    In the context of electromagnetic waves, a sinusoidal field can represent the electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. For example, in free space, the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) of an electromagnetic wave can be expressed as:    E(t, x) = E_0 * sin(kx - ωt + φ)    B(t, x) = B_0 * sin(kx - ωt + φ)      where:  - E_0 and B_0 are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively,  - k is the wave number (related to the wavelength),  - ω is the angular frequency (related to the frequency of oscillation),  - t is time,   - x is the position in space, and   - φ is the phase constant.    Sinusoidal fields are important because they simplify the analysis of wave phenomena, allowing us to use Fourier analysis to break down complex waveforms into their sinusoidal components. This is particularly useful in fields like optics, acoustics, and electrical engineering, where understanding wave behavior is crucial.
__label__1 Gaining karma on Reddit can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it often requires a mix of strategy, engagement, and community understanding. Here are some tips to help you increase your karma:    1. **Post Quality Content**: Share interesting, funny, or insightful content that resonates with the community. This could be original photos, artwork, stories, or even well-thought-out opinions on current events.    2. **Engage with Comments**: When you post something, be active in the comments section. Respond to users, answer questions, and engage in discussions. This not only boosts your post's visibility but can also earn you additional karma from upvotes on your comments.    3. **Choose the Right Subreddits**: Different subreddits have different cultures and interests. Make sure to post in communities that align with your content. For example, if you have a funny meme, post it in a humor subreddit rather than a serious discussion forum.    4. **Timing is Key**: Post when your target subreddit is most active. This often means during peak hours when more users are online. You can use tools or check the subreddit’s activity patterns to find the best times.    5. **Follow the Rules**: Each subreddit has its own rules and guidelines. Make sure to read and follow them to avoid having your posts removed, which can negatively impact your karma.    6. **Be Authentic**: Authenticity resonates with users. Share your genuine thoughts and experiences rather than trying to cater to what you think will get the most upvotes. People appreciate honesty and are more likely to engage with your content.    7. **Participate in Discussions**: Commenting on popular posts can also earn you karma. If you have something valuable to add to a conversation, don’t hesitate to share your thoughts.    8. **Use Eye-Catching Titles**: If you’re posting something, make sure your title is engaging and descriptive. A good title can draw more users to your post, increasing the chances of upvotes.    9. **Share Useful Information**: Posts that provide helpful tips, guides, or resources tend to do well. If you have expertise in a certain area, consider sharing your knowledge with the community.    10. **Be Patient**: Gaining karma takes time. Don’t get discouraged if your posts don’t get the attention you hoped for right away. Keep engaging and contributing positively to the community.    What strategies have you found effective for gaining karma? Any tips or experiences to share?

I'm particularly interested in the hatchback version, but I'm open to the sedan as well.

__label__1 I've been using kratom for a while now, and I've noticed that it really boosts my appetite. At first, I thought it was just me, but I've seen a few posts mentioning similar experiences.     When I take kratom, especially the red strains, I find myself craving snacks and meals more than usual. It's like my body is asking for more fuel. I’ve been trying to manage it by eating healthier snacks, but sometimes I just can't resist the urge to indulge.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do you handle the increased appetite? Any tips on managing cravings while still enjoying kratom? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I'm on the hunt for a versatile backpack that can handle both my daily commute and occasional travel without breaking the bank. Ideally, I'm looking for something under $100 that has a good balance of durability, comfort, and organization.     Here are a few features I'm hoping to find:  - **Size**: Enough capacity for a laptop (15-inch) and some clothes for a weekend trip, but not too bulky for everyday use.  - **Pockets**: A few compartments for organization, including a dedicated laptop sleeve, water bottle pockets, and maybe a front pocket for quick access to essentials.  - **Comfort**: Padded shoulder straps and a breathable back panel would be great for long days.  - **Style**: Something that looks decent for both work and casual outings.    I've been eyeing a few options like the **Osprey Daylite Plus** and the **REI Co-op Flash 22**, but I'm open to suggestions! What budget-friendly backpacks have you all found that fit the bill? Any personal experiences or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 In times of distress, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and lost. As Stoics, we are reminded that our perceptions and reactions to events are within our control, even if the events themselves are not.     When faced with challenges, consider the teachings of Epictetus, who said, "It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters." This perspective encourages us to focus on our responses rather than the circumstances that cause us pain or confusion.     If you are struggling, take a moment to reflect on what is within your control. Can you change your thoughts about the situation? Can you take a small action that might lead to improvement? Remember, the Stoic practice of journaling can also be a powerful tool to clarify your thoughts and feelings.     Reach out to others for support, but also remember to cultivate your inner resilience. You have the strength to navigate through this, and by applying Stoic principles, you can find peace amidst the chaos.     What specific challenges are you facing? Perhaps we can explore them together and find a Stoic approach to help you through.

__label__0 I just got accepted as a transfer student to my local university for Mechanical Engineering. I did a year as a computer science student at another university and spent the last few knocking out anything that will transfer at my local community college.     I've taken several programming classes, Physics I &amp; II, Calc I &amp; II, and Chem I. I'll take Calc III and Chem II at the community college along with Engineering Seminar I and Statics at the university next semester, Diff EQ as a summer class, and then things get hairy next fall as they want me to take Thermodynamics, Dynamics, Mechanics of Elastic Bodies, and Materials Science in one semester.     I'm as excited as I have been for anything in my life, but I'm also extremely nervous. Does anybody have any words of wisdom to help put my mind at ease?

__label__1 I’m currently studying quadratic equations and I’m having a hard time understanding the concept of the quadratic formula. I know it’s used to find the roots of a quadratic equation, which is in the form of ax² + bx + c = 0, but the formula itself seems really complicated:    x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)    I’ve read that the discriminant (b² - 4ac) tells us about the nature of the roots, but I’m struggling to grasp how to apply this in practice.     Could someone break this down into simpler terms? Maybe provide an example of how to use the formula step by step? I’d really appreciate any help or resources that could make this clearer for me. Thanks!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently got my septum pierced about a week ago, and I wanted to get some feedback on the placement. I went to a reputable piercer who has done a lot of work for me in the past, so I trust their skills.     However, I’ve been looking at it in the mirror and I’m not entirely sure if it’s positioned correctly. It seems to sit a bit higher than I expected, but I’ve seen some people with higher placements that look great.     I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference. I’m also experiencing some mild swelling and tenderness, which I know is normal for a fresh piercing, but I’m just a bit anxious about the placement.     Could you all share your thoughts? Is there a general rule for how low or high a septum should be? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I just had to share my experience with the platforming section from Subterranean Shunning Grounds to Deeproot Depths. I swear, I’ve faced bosses that took me hours to beat, but nothing has frustrated me quite like this descent.     First off, the sheer number of times I fell to my death was staggering. I lost count after the fifth time, and I’m pretty sure I could have beaten Malenia in that time instead. The camera angles are a nightmare, and the inconsistent hitboxes on the ledges made it feel like I was playing a game of chance rather than skill.     To put it into perspective, here are a few things that killed me fewer times than that platforming section:    1. **Malenia, Blade of Miquella** - I’ve fought her countless times, and while she’s a tough cookie, I managed to learn her patterns and eventually beat her.   2. **Radahn’s Meteorite Attack** - I mean, who hasn’t been flattened by that? But at least it was a one-time deal, not a repeated fall into the abyss.   3. **The Tree Sentinel** - I thought I was ready for him, but he took me down a few times before I figured out his moves. Still, it was a more enjoyable experience than the platforming hell.   4. **The Giant’s Fire Breath** - Sure, it’s deadly, but at least I could see it coming. The platforming felt like a cruel joke, where the game was just waiting for me to misstep.   5. **The Crucible Knight** - A tough fight, but again, I could strategize. The platforming? Just pure RNG.    I’m convinced that FromSoftware designed this section to test our patience more than our skills. I love the challenge of Elden Ring, but this was a whole new level of frustration. Anyone else feel my pain? What’s your most frustrating platforming moment in the game?
__label__0 Tee Higgins has been shooting up the Bengals depth chart and looks to have cemented himself as the #3 passing option in that offense. He’s poised to rise even more depending on what happens with AJ Green this offseason.    After his 2-TD breakout this past week, what is he worth? You probably spent a mid-high 2nd on him; with his rising snap counts and involvement in the offense, is he worth a 1st rounder now?     I feel like the sky’s the limit for this guy; I imagine there are a lot of Joe Burrow owners that want Higgins to pair with Burrow, but after how Higgins looked on Sunday I’m thinking he’s a great player to just hold.    If you own Higgins, what would get you to move him?
__label__1 Conservationists advocate for protecting the environment and preserving natural resources, while Conservatives often prioritize economic growth and development, sometimes at the expense of the environment. It's ironic that both groups are ultimately concerned with the future—Conservationists want to ensure a livable planet for future generations, while Conservatives often focus on maintaining a strong economy for the same purpose. Yet, they seem to be at odds with each other, as if they can't see that they are both fighting for a better future, just from different angles.

I currently have a standard 1080p monitor, but I'm ready to upgrade to something that offers better color accuracy and higher resolution.    Here are my requirements:  - **Resolution**: Ideally 1440p or 4K, as I want to see more detail in my editing work.  - **Refresh Rate**: At least 144Hz for gaming, as I play a lot of fast-paced games.  - **Color Accuracy**: I need something that covers a wide color gamut (like sRGB and Adobe RGB) for my editing tasks.  - **Panel Type**: I’m leaning towards IPS for better viewing angles and color reproduction, but I’m open to suggestions.  - **Budget**: I’m looking to spend around $600-$800, but I can stretch a bit for the right monitor.    I've been looking at options like the LG UltraGear 27GP850 and the Dell UltraSharp U2720Q, but I’m not sure if they’re the best fit for my needs.     Any recommendations or experiences you can share? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 In the episode "Eclipse Lake," we see Luz faced with a tough decision regarding her friends and the challenges they encounter. If I had to choose an option, I would definitely go with the choice that prioritizes teamwork and friendship.     Luz has always shown that she values her friends and their bonds, and I think that in a situation like this, sticking together and supporting each other is crucial. The power of friendship is a recurring theme in the show, and I believe that by choosing to work together, they can overcome any obstacle. Plus, it would be a great way to showcase the growth of their relationships and how they’ve learned to rely on one another.     What about you all? What option would you choose and why? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I'm in the process of moving an old cast iron tub to a new location in my bathroom, and I have a few plumbing questions that I hope someone here can help me with.     1. **Drainage**: The new location for the tub is about 5 feet away from the existing drain. What’s the best way to extend the drain line? Should I use PVC or ABS piping, and what kind of fittings will I need?     2. **Ventilation**: I’ve heard that proper venting is crucial for drainage. Do I need to install a new vent for the tub, or can I tie into the existing vent stack? What are the codes I should be aware of?     3. **Water Supply Lines**: The hot and cold water supply lines will also need to be extended. Is it better to use PEX or copper for this? I’m leaning towards PEX for its flexibility, but I want to make sure it’s suitable for this application.     4. **Weight Considerations**: Since it’s a cast iron tub, I’m concerned about the weight. Do I need to reinforce the floor where the tub will sit? If so, how can I do that effectively?     Any advice or tips from those who have done a similar project would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been watching some old films and came across Sue Longhurst, a British actress from the 70s, and I couldn't help but notice how much she resembles Margot Robbie! The hair, the facial features, even the way they carry themselves in front of the camera.     I know it's a bit of a stretch, but has anyone else noticed this? It’s like they could be related or something! I wonder if Margot has ever been compared to her before. What do you all think? Is it just me seeing this resemblance, or do you agree? Any other actors or actresses you think have similar looks across different decades?

__label__0 Hey everyone,    I wanted to do something different than the common horizontal runs to and from the distroplate. Additionally I wanted to have the liquid hit a res before reaching each component. As I stated in the title, the loop barely drains... As in there will still be liquid in both reservoirs, the left half of the distro plate, and the cpu and gpu blocks. Gravity is not having any of my shit.    Loop order is as follows: top right fill &gt; pump (bottom left) &gt; bottom res &gt; GPU &gt; mid left distro &gt; top res &gt; CPU &gt; top left distro &gt; middle right (fill side) distro. The drain is the bottom most port on the right side, which also happens to be in the same section as the fill port and the returning liquid after completing the loop.    Haven't yet decided if I want to do hard tubing again, or go for some thick soft tubing with quick disconnects. Either way I'm going to deep clean it and re-order the loop when the new GPU's come out later this year. Also I have no idea why there is color bleed in the GPU block...    Hoping some more experienced folks can help me out!

__label__1 I just came across a pair of Nike Air Max 270s on sale for $90, originally priced at $150. They’re in my size and the colorway is pretty nice too. I’ve been wanting a pair of these for a while, but I’m not sure if this is a good deal or if I should wait for a better price.     What do you all think? Have you seen these go lower than $90? Should I pull the trigger or hold out? Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I'm really interested in pursuing a career in sports brands valuation, but I'm not quite sure where to start. I know that this field involves analyzing the financial worth of sports teams, merchandise, and endorsements, but I could use some guidance on how to break into it.     For those of you who have experience in this area or know someone who does, what steps would you recommend? Are there specific degrees or certifications that would be beneficial? Should I focus on gaining experience in finance, marketing, or sports management?     Additionally, are there any particular companies or organizations that are known for this type of work? Any advice on networking or finding internships would also be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 In the context of the "Stranger Things" universe, the Demogorgon is a creature from the Upside Down, and its sensory capabilities are quite different from those of typical Earth creatures. While it is often described as having a keen sense of smell, the mechanics of how it perceives its environment are not explicitly detailed in the series, leading to some speculation.    1. **Alternative Senses**: The Demogorgon may not rely solely on traditional senses like smell or sight as we understand them. Creatures from other dimensions often have unique adaptations that allow them to sense their surroundings in ways that are not familiar to us. For example, it could potentially use echolocation, thermal sensing, or even some form of electromagnetic perception to detect living beings.    2. **Blood Detection**: The claim that the Demogorgon can smell blood might not be limited to the physical act of smelling as we know it. It could be that the creature has evolved to detect certain chemical signals or pheromones released by living beings, particularly when they are injured or frightened. This could explain its ability to track prey even when they are not actively bleeding.    3. **Movement and Heat**: The Demogorgon is also shown to be highly sensitive to movement and heat. Even if a creature is not bleeding, the Demogorgon might be able to sense the heat signature of a living being or detect subtle movements, allowing it to attack even stationary targets. This could be similar to how some predators on Earth can sense the presence of prey through vibrations or changes in their environment.    4. **Instinctual Behavior**: The Demogorgon’s behavior might also be driven by instinct rather than conscious thought. It could be programmed to attack anything that it perceives as a threat or potential prey, regardless of whether it can smell blood or not. This instinctual drive could lead it to attack stationary objects or creatures that it senses in its vicinity.    In summary, while the Demogorgon’s sensory capabilities are not fully explained in "Stranger Things," it likely relies on a combination of alternative senses, instinctual behavior, and possibly even chemical detection to hunt and attack its prey. This ambiguity adds to the creature's mystique and the overall horror of the series.

__label__1 I’m reaching out because my sister (28/F) recently disclosed to me that she has memories of being sexually abused by our father when she was just 5 years old. This revelation has come as a shock to me and has left me feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to support her.     She mentioned that these memories have suddenly resurfaced, and she is struggling to process them. I want to be there for her, but I also feel a lot of confusion and concern about how to handle this situation.     I’m worried about her mental health and the impact this could have on her. She has expressed feelings of anger, betrayal, and confusion, and I want to help her navigate through this. I’m also concerned about the implications of this revelation for our family dynamics, especially since our father is still in our lives.     What steps should I take to support her? Should we consider seeking professional help together? I want to ensure that she feels safe and supported, but I also want to make sure I’m handling this in the best way possible. Any advice or experiences from others who have been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I'm currently working on a C++ project where I need to read data from a file and assign that data to specific variables. I have a basic understanding of file I/O in C++, but I'm not sure about the best practices for reading different types of data and handling potential errors.     Here's a simplified version of what I'm trying to achieve:    1. The file contains several lines, each with a specific format (e.g., `name age height`).  2. I want to read each line, parse the data, and assign it to appropriate variables (e.g., `std::string name; int age; float height;`).  3. I also want to ensure that I handle any errors that may occur during file reading, such as the file not existing or having incorrect data formats.    Could someone provide a code example or outline the steps I should follow to accomplish this? Additionally, any tips on error handling and best practices for file I/O in C++ would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 What a game, Colts fans! The Indianapolis Colts put on a dominant performance today, absolutely obliterating the New York Jets with a final score of 38-10. From the opening drive, it was clear that the Colts were in control, showcasing a balanced offensive attack and a stifling defense that left the Jets scrambling.    Jonathan Taylor was a beast on the ground, racking up over 150 rushing yards and finding the end zone twice. It’s great to see him back to his explosive self after a slow start to the season. The offensive line deserves a shoutout too; they created some massive holes for him and kept the pressure off our quarterback.    Speaking of the quarterback, I thought Anthony Richardson played exceptionally well today. He made smart decisions, threw for over 250 yards, and connected on a couple of deep balls that really energized the crowd. His chemistry with Michael Pittman Jr. is developing nicely, and it’s exciting to see what they can do as the season progresses.    Defensively, the Colts were relentless. The pass rush was on fire, and we saw some great plays from our secondary, including a key interception that shifted the momentum in our favor. The Jets just couldn’t find any rhythm, and it felt like our defense was in their backfield all game long.    Overall, this was a statement win for the Colts, and it’s clear that we’re building something special this season. What were your favorite moments from the game? Any standout performances you want to highlight? Let’s discuss! GO COLTS!

__label__1 What if dogs come back as people? Like, imagine your golden retriever reincarnated as a chill dude named "Buddy" who just loves to hang out and play fetch at the park. He’d probably be the friendliest guy around, always wagging his metaphorical tail and making friends with everyone.     And what if they still had some of their dog traits? Like, Buddy would be the guy who can’t resist chasing after squirrels or getting super excited over a tennis ball. He’d probably be the life of the party, just running around, spreading joy and slobbery kisses.     But then, you’d have to deal with the fact that he might still have that instinct to bark at the mailman or dig through the trash. Can you imagine explaining to your boss why your coworker is barking at the delivery guy?     It’s a wild thought, but it makes me wonder if they’d still remember us. Like, would Buddy recognize me and come running up for a hug? Or would he just be a regular dude who loves pizza and naps? Either way, I think the world would be a much happier place with our furry friends walking around on two legs.     What do you guys think? Would your dog come back as a cool person or a total weirdo?

__label__1 Losing friends in your mid-20s can be a really tough experience, and I’m currently navigating through it myself. It feels like a strange transition where the friendships that once felt solid start to fade away, often without any clear reason.     I’ve noticed that as we all start to focus on our careers, relationships, and personal growth, some friendships just don’t seem to fit anymore. It’s not that there’s any animosity; it’s more like we’re all just drifting in different directions.     I’m finding it hard to cope with the loneliness that comes with this change. I miss the fun times and the support system I once had. I’ve tried reaching out to reconnect, but it often feels one-sided, and I don’t want to force anything.     For those of you who have gone through similar experiences, how did you handle losing friends during this stage of life? What strategies did you use to cope with the feelings of loss? Did you find new friendships, and if so, how did you go about building those connections? Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I’ve always taken pride in both my writing and public speaking skills, as an English major and regular preacher at my former church. But then I had an extremely intimidating and demanding LP teacher who panned me and specifically went after my English background every single time I met with her to discuss my work.     I’ve worked a lot of shitty jobs and can take my share of criticism, and I understand I don’t have to be perfect. I have done well in school and haven’t really given a shit about what anyone thinks about me for the most part. However, getting kicked in the balls every time I thought I was getting a handle on crucial professional skills sucked and made me incredibly self-conscious. The only two things I’ve always felt really good at are suddenly the things I feel most embarrassed about as a young potential lawyer.     I know I’m not alone here. The entire process of getting into law school, doing all the bullshit, 1L internship search, 1L internship, 2L internship search, more school, 2L internship, more school, stressful big kid job…it’s fun and exciting but it’s also an endless mindfuck. When you guys feel lost and down on yourselves, what do you do to get out of that mindset?

__label__1 I've been experiencing some inconsistent performance with my gaming PC. Some days, everything runs smoothly, and I can play demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Call of Duty: Warzone at high settings without any issues. However, on other days, I notice significant frame drops and stuttering, even in less demanding games.     I have a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, an RTX 2060 GPU, and 16GB of RAM. I've checked for background processes that might be using up resources, and I've also made sure my drivers are up to date.     I’m wondering if this could be related to thermal throttling, power settings, or maybe even something with my Windows installation. Has anyone else experienced this kind of performance inconsistency? Any tips on how to diagnose or fix this issue would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’m still reeling from the fact that my family didn’t show up to my wedding. I had always dreamed of a big celebration surrounded by loved ones, but when the day finally came, it felt like a nightmare.     I had sent out invitations months in advance, and I made sure to communicate how much it meant to me to have my family there. I even reached out multiple times to confirm their attendance. My parents and siblings assured me they would be there, but as the day approached, I started to feel uneasy.     On the day of the wedding, I was filled with excitement and nerves. I walked down the aisle, surrounded by friends and my partner’s family, but when I looked around, I realized my family was missing. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe they were just running late. But as the ceremony went on, it became painfully clear that they weren’t coming.     After the ceremony, I received a text from my mom saying they decided not to attend because they didn’t approve of my partner. They felt that my choice was a mistake and didn’t want to support it. I was devastated. I had hoped they would at least show up to celebrate my happiness, even if they didn’t agree with my choice.     The day was bittersweet. I was surrounded by love from my friends and my partner’s family, but the absence of my own family left a huge hole in my heart. I spent the reception trying to enjoy myself, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of betrayal and sadness.     Now, I’m left wondering how to move forward. I’ve always been close to my family, but this feels like a breaking point. I don’t know if I can forgive them for missing such an important day in my life. I’m still processing everything, and I just needed to share my experience. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you cope?

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m looking to upgrade my PC specifically for Assetto Corsa Competizione and I’d love to get some advice from the community. Currently, I’m running an i5-8400 with a GTX 1060 and 16GB of RAM. While I can run the game, I’m not getting the performance I want, especially during online races with a full grid.

Would the i7 be a good choice for this?     Lastly, if anyone has suggestions for cooling solutions or power supplies that would pair well with these components, I’d appreciate it!     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I've been on a bit of a rollercoaster with LSD lately, and I’m starting to feel the effects of what I can only describe as overindulgence. I’ve had some incredible experiences, but I’ve also pushed it too far, taking it multiple days in a row and not giving myself enough time to recover.     Now, I’m feeling a bit off.

__label__1 When it comes to sharing information with friends, there are certain topics that can lead to complications, misunderstandings, or even damage to relationships. Here are some types of information that might be best kept private:    1. **Financial Details**: Sharing specifics about your income, debts, or financial struggles can lead to awkwardness or jealousy. Money can be a sensitive topic, and discussing it too openly might change how your friends perceive you.    2. **Personal Relationships**: Details about your romantic relationships, especially if they involve conflicts or intimate issues, can be risky. Friends may feel uncomfortable or take sides, which can strain friendships.    3. **Health Issues**: While it’s important to have a support system, sharing too much about your health problems or mental health struggles can sometimes lead to unwanted advice or pity. It’s okay to share what you’re comfortable with, but be mindful of how much you disclose.    4. **Family Problems**: Family dynamics can be complicated, and sharing too much about family issues can lead to gossip or judgment. It’s often better to keep these matters private unless you’re seeking specific advice.    5. **Secrets of Others**: If someone confides in you, it’s crucial to respect their privacy. Sharing someone else's secrets can break trust and damage relationships.    6. **Future Plans**: Sometimes, sharing your big dreams or plans can lead to skepticism or negativity from others. It might be better to keep your aspirations to yourself until you’re ready to act on them.    7. **Personal Insecurities**: While it’s healthy to talk about insecurities with close friends, oversharing can lead to them viewing you differently or feeling uncomfortable. It’s important to find a balance.    8. **Controversial Opinions**: If you have strong opinions on sensitive topics (politics, religion, etc.), sharing them can lead to heated debates or rifts in friendships. It’s often wise to gauge the room before diving into these discussions.    Ultimately, the key is to know your friends well and understand their boundaries as well as your own. Trust your instincts about what feels right to share and what might be better kept private.
__label__1 I've been trying to set up Remote Desktop on my Windows 10 machine, but I'm running into some issues. I want to be able to access my PC from another location, but every time I try to connect, I get an error message saying that the remote desktop can't connect to the computer.

I've tried restarting both machines and double-checking all settings, but nothing seems to work. Is there something I'm missing? Any help or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just encountered a frustrating glitch where my Player Experience Points (PXP) didn't count towards my missions in MLB The Show. I was grinding through some of the new missions for the latest program, and after a solid game, I noticed that none of the PXP I earned was reflected in the mission progress.     Has anyone else experienced this? I was using a diamond player and thought for sure I’d be racking up points. I even double-checked my settings and made sure I was in the right mode. It’s really disheartening to put in the effort and not see any rewards for it.     If anyone has found a workaround or if this is a known issue, please share! I’d love to get back to grinding without worrying about losing progress.

I’ve been on the wait list for 9 months even though my friend put in a reassignment to the same city after me and already got the transfer while mine is sitting in limbo on hold. I have no call outs, no injuries, no safety issues, no dog bites and my performance is perfect so as of today I have 1 call out out of 7 years of working for these idiots.

__label__0 I’m in the US. I got my newest paycheck, and Paycor says the raise was from $10.25 to $10.50. My GM said this paycheck should have my crew trainer raise.       is this normal for a crew trainer raise? I shouldn’t question anybody right like surely it was put in right? I’m only asking cuz I thought my GM said it would be 75 cents raise, but maybe I misheard or he misspoke
__label__1 Hello everyone!      I’m currently on the lookout for a flat in Hyderabad and could really use some help. I’m looking for a 2BHK or 3BHK apartment, preferably in areas like Gachibowli, Hitech City, or Banjara Hills. My budget is around 50-70 lakhs.

__label__1 Organizing your army in Hearts of Iron IV can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially with the sheer number of divisions and the complexity of the game mechanics. Here are some tips that have helped me streamline my military organization:    1. **Use Army Groups**: Create army groups for different fronts or theaters of war. For example, if you're fighting in Europe and Africa, have separate army groups for each continent. This helps keep your commands clear and manageable.    2. **Assign Generals Wisely**: Make sure to assign generals with traits that complement the type of warfare you’re engaging in. For instance, if you’re focusing on offensive operations, choose generals with offensive traits. This can significantly boost your army's effectiveness.    3. **Create Templates**: Design division templates that suit your strategy. For example, if you’re playing as Germany, you might want to create a strong Panzer division template with a mix of armor and motorized infantry. Having a few well-designed templates can save you time when you’re building new divisions.    4. **Use the Frontline System**: Utilize the frontline and offensive line features effectively. Set up frontlines where you want your armies to hold or advance, and then draw offensive lines to indicate where you want them to push. This helps in automating your army’s movements and can lead to more strategic advances.    5. **Keep Supply Lines in Mind**: Always consider your supply situation when organizing your army. Make sure your divisions are not too far from supply hubs, and avoid overextending your frontlines. If you notice supply issues, it might be worth reorganizing your divisions to ensure they are more concentrated.    6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As the war progresses, your needs will change. Regularly review your army composition and organization. If you find certain divisions are underperforming, consider reassigning them or changing their templates.    7. **Use Air Support and Naval Support**: Don’t forget to coordinate with your air force and navy. Having air superiority can make a huge difference in battles, so ensure your armies are supported by air units when launching offensives.    8. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Finally, the best way to get better at organizing your army is to play more games. Each nation has its unique challenges, and the more you play, the more you’ll learn about effective army organization.    What strategies do you all use to keep your armies organized? Any tips or tricks that have worked for you?
__label__1 I've been living in a really chaotic environment lately, and it's been taking a toll on my mental health. The constant fighting around me has been triggering so many flashbacks from my past trauma, and I feel like I'm on the edge of a breakdown. Just the other day, I found myself shaking with anger for what felt like the first time ever. It was overwhelming, and I finally reached a point where I couldn't hold it in anymore. I spoke up about how I was feeling, which is a big step for me, but it also felt like I was just venting into a void.     I know that expressing my feelings is important, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that my words didn’t really matter to anyone else. I feel like my mind is in pieces, and I’m struggling to put it all back together. I keep replaying the arguments and the hurtful things that were said, and it’s like I’m stuck in this loop of anger and sadness.     I’m trying to remind myself that it’s okay to feel this way, that my feelings are valid, but it’s tough when the environment around me feels so hostile. I just want to find some peace and clarity, but it feels so far away right now. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you cope when your living situation is so triggering? I could really use some support and advice.
__label__0 Alright so I’m hopping on here in hopes that I can get some opinions or help on what’s going on with me the past couple weeks.    First of all, you should know a few things about me.  - The first thing is that I have insomnia.  - I am the only one in my room. All of our pets are outside of my room at all times.  - I still live at home but I usually sleep when my parents are at work. They know not to bother me but when I sleep for over 16 hrs my mom usually opens the door and calls my name. Just to make sure I haven’t hurt myself.   - I am a Christian. I pray every night that God keeps me, my family and my house safe. I ask him to take away all evil or negative things out of my room and away from my family.  - I definitely believe in the paranormal. I grew up watching those ghost hunting tv shows so understand how most of it works (or so I think).   - When I was little I would have the scariest nightmares. They were so bad that I was absolutely terrified to sleep in my room. I would sleep with my parents up until they kicked me out so eventually I started to sleep on the floor beside their bed, by their door or in the hallway. One night I was sleeping in my bed and saw a finger across from my bed. I was scared out of my mind but somehow got myself to check if it was my blankets tag, curtain, something outside, a toy or anything that could be in the way between my eyes and the window where I saw it. When I realized it was nothing I could explain, I screamed for my dad. He checked everything out and couldn’t find anything. When he shut the lights off and I tried to go back to sleep in the same spot I was in, it was gone. The only thing I remember after that night was sitting on the toilet, of all things, in the middle of the night feeling defeated and tired. I prayed for God to take away the bad things and bad dreams. After that night, they were gone completely. I’ve never experienced another nightmare after that. I was about 6 years old then. I’m 22 now.  - This one is goofy but I will tell y’all that I have always been extremely sensitive to people’s energy and the paranormal. I’m fine with scary movies but when it comes to real life or those tv shows like Ghost Adventures or The Haunting, I get goosebumps and I cry (not out of fear).    So now that you know all of that I’ll tell you what’s going on with me right now. Like I said, I have a messed up sleeping schedule which makes me overtired, I sleep alone with the door shut and I pray away all of the negativity.    A few months ago I caught myself talking in my sleep. I have never done that before. Id wake myself up talking to my best friend, thinking she was standing next to my bed. I caught myself yelling at my pet rat because I thought she got out of her cage again because I literally saw and heard movement, that’s not it because she passed away years ago. I also thought it was my dog a few times. And I thought I heard my mom come in my room a few times so I yelled at her to get out. She was never in there.  A couple weeks ago I took 4 melatonin and went to bed on 20 hrs of no sleep. I woke up shortly after falling asleep to the idea of a spider being on the ceiling above me. I shot up out of bed, fell on the floor tangled in blankets and then realized it was just in my head. I went back to sleep after that. Literally just blamed it on the melatonin because that stuff usually gives me weird/realistic dreams.  Now this is where it starts to worry me. Most nights now I will fall asleep and 30 mins later I’ll feel something on the bottom of my bed. The first time it was just light shaking. I recognized the feeling because when the wind shuts a door too fast, my dog who has anxiety will run to me and shake at the bottom of my bed. It felt just like that so I woke up to get her but quickly realized I was the only one in the room and my door never opened. That’s happened a few times and each time I just go back to sleep without a second thought. After that it escalated to me thinking my mom had just walked into my room to talk to me or check up on me. I’d tell her I was sleeping or to go away and when she wouldn’t say anything I’d flash my phone light and again, I was alone the whole time. It seriously sounded like someone was walking from the door to the other side of my bed. But this last one is what made me create this account and post my story. The other night I had just fallen asleep and felt the same sensation of the bed shaking again. I woke up and thought about it, prayed for God to take away everything in my room that wasn’t sent by Him, rolled over and fell back asleep. I was asleep for 13 minutes at that point. About 25 minutes after falling asleep again I felt the shaking again but it was very intense. So bad that it made my body shake with it. I ignored it (???) and tried to go back to sleep until I felt something move from next to my feet.. up the bed next to my legs, crawl onto the body pillow that’s laying vertically beside me and stop. For a second I pictured my mom and the dog trying to lay in bed with me but that didn’t make sense so I kicked my leg to where it was sitting and nothing was there. I sat up feeling around and nothing was around me so I grabbed my phone and flashed the light. NOTHING was physically there. At that point I was just annoyed so I said “ istg if you don’t get out of MY ROOM...”. I laid back down and said “in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you”. I tried... lol. I don’t think I have sleep paralysis because this is a new thing and I can move right away. I’m not actually paralyzed. I do sometimes see a back shadow or mass in the corner of my room though. I’ve just always debunked it as my eyes messing with me because my room is so dark.     Do you have any idea of what that could be? Do I have sleep paralysis? Am I hallucinating because I’m overtired? Could it be a medication I’m taking even though I’ve been on it for over a year? Is it something paranormal coming after me?   I will say that I have felt like something has been after me since I was a kid. One of the scariest nightmares I’ve had was me being abandoned by my mom in a place that had no sky, fire all around us and people walking around with no emotions. It felt like a “child’s version of Hell”. I have never felt my house, that’s an old farm house, was ever haunted or anyone in my family to be haunted. That’s why I think it’s coming for me. I’m the only one who has had these experiences. The only reason it hasn’t gotten me yet or hasn’t hurt me too badly is because of God. I know that He and his army are fighting off the evil around me. I know I’m protected but my goodness, whatever is coming for me (if that is what’s happening), it’s trying real hard and getting closer to me. Im not scared yet, just curious and confused.    UPDATE: I got up at 5:30am because I was so pissed off. I couldn’t get much sleep because it happened 2 more times last night. I felt the bed shake and thought my mom was standing next to me. I thought she was talking and I could see movement but nothing was there.

__label__1 I recently went through the process of applying for a passport for my child, and I thought it might be helpful to share the steps involved, especially for those in Nepal who might be navigating this for the first time.    1. **Gather Required Documents**: You will need the following documents:     - Birth certificate of the minor (original and a photocopy)     - Citizenship certificate of the minor (if available)     - Passport-sized photographs (usually 2, but check the latest requirements)     - A copy of the parents' citizenship certificates or passports     - A completed passport application form (available at the Department of Passport or online)    2. **Fill Out the Application Form**: Make sure to fill out the application form accurately. If you’re unsure about any section, it’s best to ask for help at the passport office.    3. **Parental Consent**: Both parents need to provide consent for the minor’s passport application. This can be done by signing the application form. If one parent is unavailable, a notarized consent letter from the absent parent may be required.    4. **Visit the Passport Office**: Take all the gathered documents to the nearest passport office. It’s advisable to go early to avoid long queues. You may also want to check if you need to book an appointment in advance.    5. **Submit the Application**: At the passport office, submit the application along with all the required documents. The officials will verify everything, and you may be asked to provide additional information if needed.    6. **Pay the Fees**: There will be a fee for processing the passport application. Make sure to keep the receipt as proof of payment.    7. **Biometric Data**: Depending on the age of the minor, biometric data (like fingerprints) may be collected. For very young children, this may not be necessary.    8. **Wait for Processing**: After submission, the processing time can vary. It’s usually a few weeks, but you can check the status of the application online or by contacting the passport office.    9. **Collect the Passport**: Once the passport is ready, you will be notified to collect it. Make sure to bring an ID and the receipt of the application when you go to pick it up.    I hope this helps anyone looking to apply for a passport for their child! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

__label__0 Hi everyone, first of all, before y'all say that my parents can do whatever they want with the stuff they bought I need to tell you that I bought every single part from my desk setup out of my own money on my name and my desk setup is around 2000-2800$ worth. Also, most of this stuff it's my mum that does the bad stuff as my dad is one of those tech-dads that does know how worth computer hardware is. If I don't comply with anything they want me to do, they spray water at my desk setup while stuff is plugged in in hopes of breaking my stuff or idk. Also, I have sometimes very expensive company-provided hardware on my desk because I was working which even though I know is hard to break (Lenovo Thinkpad) I'm scared they may short circuit that laptop some day (That laptop is a 3500-4000$ workstation) and thatd bring me problems at my workplace.     Not so Fun fact: it's 3 am in the morning rn and my parents woke me up with spray water on me and my hardware because I forgot to brush my teeth and pick up some clothing I didn't put correctly in the washing basket thing.    Also, I'm 16 years old so I don't really earn alot and I'm forced to give my parents 1/6 of my salary for rent which I'm completely ok with it even though it's a bit high but I won't be paying them one cent if they keep doing this so I'll just be putting the money on my second safe bank account to be fair.    Honestly IDK how to fix any of this. Recording these scenario would be an option but showing that to someone would lead to me going to a forster family or generally be "removed" from my parents, which I 100% don't want to do. I already tried to talk with my mum and dad but my mum doesnt care and my dad can't really do much to prevent her from doing this.    It's not like I'm one of those 24/7 fortnite gamer kids. I'm trying to setup my life and become independent (honestly I play video games or do stupid things on my computer only like 2h/week. I do draw digitally on my computer alot).
__label__0 I'm sorry Frogwares, I really am. I grew up with your Sherlock Holmes games, and they are still in my personal pantheon of best detective-type of games. I always loved the way you had to piece together the different clues you encounter, in order to use adequately your dedutive skills. For me, Testament of Sherlock Holmes and Crime and Punishments are absolute must-play games and I STRONGLY encourage any reader of this thread to check them out.     Concerning Sherlock Holmes Chapter One : I have to admit, I forced myself to play this game until the end. If the endings are OK, the rest of the game is a penance. The open-world is not interesting at all, the only fun part is finding the right spot on the map based on some intel (which could be done without having to walk in the said map afterwards, they could have just designed a system in which you are teleported in the right location once it is found).     The side quests were disappointing as well because they lack the best part of Sherlock Holmes' games : connecting the clues in the "mind palace". In these quests, you just search for clues on the ground and you play a mini-game. VOILA. This mini-game consists of giving every character the right role in a reconstitution of the events. To be honest, even Batman Arkham Origins did that in a better way.     The main quests are also disappointing, because they don't really have one good ending. The developpers tried an interesting approach : making every outcome a potential official and correct one. But with that idea come some problems because everything is written in a way that multiple solutions still remain plausible. Therefore, instead of having one clever solution that pieces up everything together, you now have 2 or 3 solutions that are blurrish and unsatisfaying, because they rely on shadowy clues that are left to interpretation. That system could have been good, if every outcome had been satisfaying. But I doubt this is possible.     For example, in one of the first quests, two suspects are found with the same darts full of sedative. Therefore, that clue is useless, because it still can lead to both outcomes of the case. That is not a clever way to do what Frogware was trying to do in my opinion. Because you are just cancelling out elements that don't fit in your narrative, instead of make it more clever. In the same case, one of the suspects affirm that he was in hospital (if I recall correctly) during the murder. You will not be able to check that alibi because otherwise, the game could not achieve his "all solutions are correct" thing.    Yes, you get it : this is a detective game that forgot the main thing that makes detective games fun : a satisfaying solution that link together all the pieces in a clever, concrete and satisfaying way.    So to conclude : wait for steam sales and for god sake, buy Testament of Sherlock Holmes and Crimes and Punishments which are often sold for 5 euros.

__label__1 I've been doing a lot of thinking about my identity lately, and I feel like I might be experiencing gender dysphoria. I'm in my late 30s, and I’ve always identified as a cisgender woman, but recently I've been questioning that. I’ve started to feel uncomfortable with my body and the way I present myself, and I can’t shake the feeling that I might be more comfortable as a man or non-binary.    I guess my question is, is it okay to come out as trans later in life? I’ve heard stories of people transitioning at various ages, but I worry about what others might think or how it might affect my relationships. I have a family and a job, and I’m scared of how they would react.     Has anyone else gone through something similar? Is it common to realize this later in life? I just want to know if it’s valid to feel this way and if it’s possible to transition at my age. Any advice or experiences would be really helpful.

__label__1 Voltron strategies in EDH often get a bad rap, but I believe they can be incredibly fun and effective if built correctly. The idea of focusing on a single creature to deal damage and win the game can seem simplistic, but it allows for some really interesting gameplay dynamics.    First off, the sheer power of a well-equipped commander can be intimidating. Cards like **Eldrazi Monument** or **Sword of Fire and Ice** can turn your commander into a formidable threat that opponents must deal with immediately. This can force them to use their resources early, which can open up opportunities for other players at the table.    Additionally, Voltron decks often have a lot of built-in protection. Cards like **Swiftfoot Boots** and **Lightning Greaves** not only protect your commander from removal but also allow you to keep the pressure on your opponents. Plus, many Voltron commanders have built-in evasion or ways to get around blockers, making it easier to connect for that lethal damage.    Another aspect that makes Voltron appealing is the versatility in deck-building. You can choose a commander that fits your playstyle, whether it’s a classic like **Rafiq of the Many** for a more aggressive approach or something like **Tuvasa the Sunlit** for a more control-oriented strategy. You can also include a variety of enchantments and artifacts that can enhance your commander’s abilities, making each game feel unique.    Lastly, Voltron decks can be surprisingly resilient. With the right mix of protection spells and ways to draw cards, you can keep your strategy going even when your commander gets removed. Cards like **Heroic Intervention** or **Teferi's Protection** can save your board state and allow you to rebuild quickly.    In conclusion, while Voltron may not be the most popular strategy in EDH, it definitely has its merits. It encourages a different style of play that can be both engaging and rewarding. What are your thoughts on Voltron decks? Do you have any favorite commanders or strategies that you think work well in this archetype?
__label__1 I've been using dating apps for a while now, and I have a genuine question for all the female users out there (and guys, feel free to chime in too!). What are some of the biggest turn-offs you encounter when chatting with guys on these platforms?     I know that everyone has different preferences, but I’m curious to hear about common mistakes or behaviors that make you lose interest. Is it overly cheesy pickup lines, lack of effort in conversation, or maybe something else entirely?     Also, what are some things that do catch your attention? I think understanding this could really help guys improve their approach and make the experience better for everyone involved. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently had the chance to fly over Yosemite Valley at 30,000 feet, and it was absolutely breathtaking! The views from above really put into perspective the sheer size and beauty of the park. I could see the iconic El Capitan and Half Dome standing majestically among the lush green trees and the winding Merced River.     The contrast of the granite cliffs against the vibrant colors of the forest was stunning, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at nature's grandeur. It made me appreciate the park even more, knowing how many people come to hike and explore its wonders.     Has anyone else had the chance to see Yosemite from the air? I’d love to hear your experiences or any tips for capturing those amazing aerial shots! Also, if you have any recommendations for must-see spots in the park when visiting on the ground, please share!

Are there any existing apps that serve this purpose? If not, what features do you think would be essential for such an app? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with my Plex library where most episodes of my TV shows are not showing up, even though I'm following the correct naming conventions.

I’m running the latest version of Plex Media Server on a Windows machine.     I’ve checked the Plex naming conventions guide and everything seems to be in order. Is there something I might be missing? Could it be a metadata issue or something else? Any help would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been rewatching Better Call Saul and I couldn't help but notice that the end credits song has a similar vibe to the Breaking Bad intro theme. The way it builds up and the overall tone just feels like it could fit right into the Breaking Bad universe.     Has anyone else picked up on this? I think it really ties the two shows together in a unique way, almost like a nod to the fans. It’s fascinating how the music can evoke such strong connections between the two series.

__label__1 I’m trying to remember the name of a movie I watched a while ago, but I can’t seem to recall any details other than a few key scenes. It’s a drama that revolves around a family dealing with a major crisis. I think it might have been released in the early 2000s.     One scene that stands out is a family dinner where tensions rise, and someone ends up storming out. There’s also a subplot involving a child who is struggling with something, possibly bullying or a health issue. The film has a very emotional tone, and I remember it being quite impactful.     I believe it had a relatively well-known cast, but I can’t remember any specific actors. If anyone has any idea what this movie might be, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm 17 and just looking for someone to chat with for a bit before I head to bed. I love talking about all sorts of things—music, movies, books, or just life in general. Sometimes it can feel a bit lonely at night, so I thought it would be nice to connect with someone. If you're up for a conversation, feel free to drop a message! What’s on your mind?
__label__0 Any dashers that work the Des Moines area? Which do you prefer Ankeny, Des Moines or West Des Moines zone?
__label__1 I've been experiencing some frustrating FPS drops in Modern Warfare lately, especially during intense firefights or when there are a lot of players on screen. I’ve tried adjusting my graphics settings, lowering the resolution, and even updating my drivers, but nothing seems to help.     I’m running a decent rig with a GTX 1660 and an i5 processor, so I thought I’d be able to handle the game without too much trouble. Has anyone else been facing similar issues?     What settings have you found to help stabilize your FPS? Also, are there any specific optimizations or tweaks you recommend? I’m open to any suggestions to improve my gameplay experience!     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been trying to gather Rams quickly for crafting and upgrades, but it feels like I'm not making much progress. What are some effective strategies or tips you all use to farm Rams efficiently?     I've heard that completing certain quests and bounties can help, but are there specific ones that yield better rewards? Also, does anyone have advice on which Behemoths to hunt that might drop more Rams? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Hi all,    I'm studying hypothetical syllogisms and am familiar with the form and how it can be integrated with modus ponens/tollens.    What I am trying to clarify is if a contrapositive form of a hypothetical syllogism can be constructed, e.g.    1.  ¬Q → ¬P    2. ¬R → ¬Q    \--------------    3. ¬R → ¬P    &amp;#x200B;    1. If x is not a mammal, then x is not a human.    2. If x not warm blooded, then x is not a mammal.    3. If x is not warm-blooded, then x is not a human.    &amp;#x200B;    I'm not certain this works, so any help would be appreciated.
__label__1 What is the coolest thing you've ever experienced that also had a really negative side to it?     For me, it was skydiving. The thrill of jumping out of a plane and free-falling through the sky was absolutely exhilarating. The view was breathtaking, and the rush of adrenaline was unlike anything I've ever felt. However, the worst part was the anxiety leading up to the jump. I was terrified, questioning my sanity for even considering it. Plus, the landing was rough, and I ended up with a few bruises.     What about you? What’s your story of something that was amazing but came with a downside?
__label__1 I’ve always been a bit different from my peers, and I think that’s what led me to discover my special interest. It started when I was around 7 years old. I remember being fascinated by dinosaurs after watching a documentary on them. I would spend hours reading books, drawing pictures, and even collecting dinosaur figurines.     As I grew older, my interests shifted, but the pattern remained the same. I would latch onto something that sparked my curiosity and dive deep into it. For example, I became obsessed with space and astronomy during my teenage years. I would stay up late at night, gazing at the stars and learning about the universe.     I think what really helped me find my special interests was the freedom to explore without judgment. My parents encouraged my curiosity and allowed me to pursue what I loved, even if it seemed unusual to others.     Now, I have a few special interests that I rotate through, including coding, graphic design, and even a bit of history. Each one brings me joy and a sense of purpose. I often wonder if others have similar experiences in finding their special interests. How did you discover yours?

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’ve been having some trouble with Android Auto when it comes to navigating to specific coordinates. I often use latitude and longitude for locations that aren’t easily searchable, but it seems like Android Auto doesn’t recognize them when I try to input them directly.     For example, I’ll enter something like "37.7749,-122.4194" into Google Maps on my phone, and it works fine there, but when I connect to Android Auto, it just doesn’t seem to process it. I’ve tried using voice commands as well, but it just doesn’t understand what I’m trying to say.     Is there a workaround for this? Or is there a specific format I should be using? I’d love to hear if anyone else has faced this issue and how you managed to navigate to coordinates using Android Auto. Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I’m feeling really lost right now and I need to share my experience in hopes that someone can relate or offer some advice. I’ve been on this NoFap journey for about 30 days, and I was feeling great at first. I had more energy, my focus improved, and I felt more confident. But suddenly, everything changed.    Out of nowhere, I started experiencing intense urges that I thought I had overcome. It’s like my mind is playing tricks on me, reminding me of the temporary relief that fapping used to provide. I’ve been trying to distract myself with workouts, reading, and even meditation, but the urges just keep creeping back in stronger than before.     I’ve also noticed that my mood has taken a dive. I feel irritable and anxious, and I can’t shake this feeling of restlessness. It’s frustrating because I was making so much progress, and now I feel like I’m back at square one. I’ve read about the flatline phase, but I didn’t expect it to hit me so hard.     Has anyone else experienced this sudden shift? How did you cope with the urges and the emotional rollercoaster? I really want to stay committed to this journey, but I’m struggling right now. Any tips or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
__label__1 I know this might not be a popular opinion, but I genuinely believe that cowgirl is the best sex position. Hear me out: it offers so much versatility and intimacy. First off, it allows for a great deal of control for the person on top, which can lead to a more pleasurable experience. You can adjust the angle, depth, and pace to what feels best for you, and that’s a huge plus.    Additionally, it creates a unique opportunity for eye contact and connection, which can enhance the emotional aspect of sex. The person on top can lean forward for kisses or to whisper sweet nothings, making it feel more intimate. Plus, it’s a great way to switch things up and keep the excitement alive in the bedroom.    I also think it’s underrated in terms of physical fitness. It can be quite a workout, and it’s empowering to take charge in that way. So while some might prefer the more traditional positions, I stand by my belief that cowgirl reigns supreme. It’s time to give it the recognition it deserves!
__label__1 I'm in the process of building my first FPV drone and I'm looking for some recommendations on components. Specifically, I need a flight controller (FC), an ELRS 2.4GHz receiver (RX), and a video transmitter (VTX) along with a camera.     For the flight controller, I want something that is reliable and has good community support. I've heard good things about the Betaflight F4 and F7 boards, but I'm open to suggestions based on your experiences.     As for the ELRS 2.4GHz RX, I’m considering the Happymodel ELRS RX because of its compact size and performance. Is there a better option out there that you guys would recommend?     For the VTX, I’m looking for something that can handle 200mW to 600mW power output, with smart audio support if possible. I’ve seen the TBS Unify Pro and the AKK FX2, but I’m not sure which one is more reliable.     Lastly, I’m torn between using a traditional camera setup or an all-in-one (AIO) FPV camera. I’ve heard that AIO cameras like the Runcam Nano 3 are great for saving space and weight, but I’m concerned about image quality. What do you all think?     Any recommendations or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__0 Going to use a temporary account.    I'm 37, I met this younger girl at my workplace. She's 19. She was into me from day 1. The first day after she was hired, I was having breakfast at the bar, she was having breakfast at the bar too.. and I noticed she was totally staring at me from the next table. We kinda became friends, I'm friendly to everyone.. and after we became friends,  she said ''you could totally be a movie star with your looks'' and  ''you could just roll out of bed early in the morning and you'd still look like a male model'' lol      I'm only giving context. I frankly do not care about my looks. I like looking clean, I put effort into my wardrobe, I like smelling good and wearing fragrances.. but as a dude I'd feel stupid if I cared about how hot I am. I didn't even appreciate the compliment, I was just indifferent to it.    I have never wanted to do anything with her. She's cute, but I'm a 37 year old man and not a thirsty dude who likes to sleep with just any woman. She's  still a teenager at the end of the day.  We've stayed friends, but we aren't *close friends,* I'm not going to call her and ask her to hang out, she just enjoys texting  me when she wants someone to talk to and I gladly listen when she wants to talk.     This morning she just suddenly hugged me, and I found that cute because I'm 6'2 and she's just 5'1,   she just looks like an adorable little thing to me.     She was like ''I feel safe around you. You make me feel good and you come across as a  strong, confident man.... I kinda wish you were my dad''    I usually am not a very emotional person, but everything was just so cute I said ''you're so cute you want to make me adopt you'' and she was like ''yes please''      Idk, probably everyone would think I'm preying on a younger girl if they saw us hanging out, but the truth is that I just wanna keep her 'cause she's too adorable
__label__0 So earlier you start the bigger the chance you'll be a great violinist(do you agree with this guys?). I have like approximately 35 thousand hours need to catch up in order to try to achieve my dream as soloist aspirant or atleast violin accompaniment in big orchestra. This is why I'm acting like I want rush everything so my apologies:)     Is it too late to dream of being preeminent violinist?     Ps: I only live once so I've dream to be remembered as great one (it may sound foolish) I gotta practice 45 hours a day :)    Edit: by the way I'm 15 years old I forgot to mention.
__label__1 I wanted to share my experience with my mother-in-law (MIL) and see if anyone else has had similar feelings or situations. Ever since I got married, I've had a hard time trusting my MIL. It’s not that she’s done anything overtly wrong, but there’s just something about her behavior that makes me uneasy.    For instance, she often tries to undermine my decisions regarding my children, suggesting that I’m not doing things the ‘right’ way. She also has a tendency to share personal family matters with others, which makes me feel like my privacy is being invaded.     I’ve tried to communicate my feelings to my partner, but they seem to think I’m overreacting. I don’t want to create tension in the family, but I also don’t want to feel uncomfortable in my own home.     Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to navigate this without causing a rift in the family would be greatly appreciated.
__label__0 When arriving at Cairo airport in the middle of the night at around 3AM, does anyone know if there will be Ubers available at that time of night? or taxis? or more advisable to arrange something with a driver beforehand?
