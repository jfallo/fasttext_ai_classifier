__label__0 I've been dating this girl for 13 months (long distance) . We always had arguments but nothing we couldn't resolve in less than a day except 1 thing. We already broken up once because of her stubbornness but we got back together after that and everything was better than ever.     The first break up was because of a third party. She "seen something" in him. I told her exactly what will happen but she was in denial until it was too late and already separated hersel from me. They were always a little suspicious but I trusted her. Long story short she broke up with me eventually. We had a big argument after I got my belongings back and then she admitted everything, that she was in denial, that I was right and I need to find someone better but she is sorry, she will still start to date this guy. I accepted my fate, she didn't want me. I started going out with my friends again, I started talking to girls just to fill this hole she left in me. I hated every part of it, but still showed her that I was fine and I accept her decision even tough I felt miserable.     She kept in contact and saw I was fine but she struggled hard. She had all the problems in her new relationship.   After a while she was so sure she wants me back that I got non stop messages and calls while I was at a party, saying she wants me to be with her and do something to pass time.   After 3 weeks or so. She realised that her life was unhappy and we still talked and had lots of fun together so why not give it another go. I was (and still in) love so of course I said yes.     Everything was perfect until now. She started going out a lot recently again. Was always with multiple boys since she has no girl friends. I had no problem with that. I always asked who she is going with, and what time she will get back so maybe we can watch a movie or play games while in a call after she gets back. But somehow that got her mad sometimes, still doesn't really understand why. So all in all, she just started acting distant again. I knew she still loved me. We had a lot of fun while playing games or when we met. It was lovely.     Last sunday she went out with her friends all day long. It was weird because she didn't want to meet with me the day before so she can "rest". We still could play games and watch Netflix all day she said. But meeting was too much? I wanted to see her, we only see each other for a day every week. Maybe even less. Suddenly it's too much to ask for but going to shops and all that with 4 of her guy friends is fine even though they see each other every day? We had lots of arguments during that day. I told her i felt emotionally neglected that week and it made me sad, no questions about my day, or how I was. Nothing for a week. Now she goes out all day and doesn't even text me once even after I let her know I had a bad day. After a day of arguing. I woke up the next day to a text: "sorry I need space, i need free time, i need "me" time. I want to spend time with my friends and im tired of the arguing. We are over for good this time."     I don't understand, after a rough day she just gives up on me and blames everything on me? That i don't give her space and all that even tough she never told me she wants this. She wanted the opposite before. To be together. Non stop calls after school, weekends together, talk all day, dates etc. Now everything changed in a week without her letting me know so it's my fault? I couldn't even adapt since I didn't know she had this needs. I told her that if she just talked to me about all this we would be happy and have no problems. But she doesn't want to, created a big wall around herself and doesn't show any emotions around me. We even had a call yesterday for 2 hours, just chatting about our day but no emotions at all. It was a nonchalant talk from her side, it felt so off. She was never like this before. Not even when she broke up with me last time. Only emotions she showed was 2 giggles on my stupid jokes and that was it. Even she told me we still can meet and be friends but she doesn't feel anything towards me anymore. In a day? How is that possible? It is almost like last time. But now no real explanation, no talks about it, just skipping every question, texting back and talking without emotions, even when she is the first to hit me up.    How should I reconnect with her emotionally? What even happened to her? Why doesn't she wants to talk it out? I try to distance myself but it's hard. I'm always waiting for her to text me or anything. I don't want her to leave, I love her to death.
__label__1 I recently came across a deal for a lot of Skylanders figures and I’m trying to decide if it’s worth it. The seller is offering a bundle that includes several rare figures, some of which I’ve been hunting for a while. The price seems too good to be true, and I’m a bit skeptical.     For those of you who have experience with buying lots of Skylanders, do you think it’s worth the investment? Have you ever found a similar deal that turned out to be a steal? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips on what to look out for when buying in bulk!

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 22-year-old female in the United States, and I'm feeling a bit lonely lately. I'm looking to connect with someone who can share some laughs, good conversations, and maybe even some adventures.     I enjoy a variety of things like hiking, watching movies, and trying out new recipes. I’m also a big fan of music and love discovering new artists. If you’re someone who’s open-minded, fun, and looking for a genuine connection, I’d love to hear from you!     Let’s chat and see where it goes. Feel free to drop a message!

__label__0 Some of us are here for the tactical drip, some are working on our gunfighting skills only, some are preppers branching into learning rifle and pistol for self-defense.     Where do your priorities lie? Should we prep more or less? Should we train tactically more or less?     Obviously some of that is situation-dependent but you can bet most things worth training or prepping for are going to change life in most of the same ways: limited or no electricity, inconsistent water pressure and quality, uncontrolled structure fires, limited civil services, the list goes on.     Most of us here are working on kit for both, but would love to hear some unique perspectives on prepping or tactical gear that might be worth skipping, or things we absolutely should be saving for.
__label__1 I just had a match where I was feeling pretty confident, but then I got absolutely wrecked by a squad that was clearly way above my skill level. I mean, I know I’m not the best player out there, but the moment demotion protection went away, it felt like I was thrown into the deep end without a life jacket!     It’s tough love for sure, but I think it’s a good way to keep players on their toes. It really makes you rethink your strategies and pushes you to improve. I’ve been trying to focus on my positioning and communication with my squad, but man, it’s a grind!     Anyone else feeling the pressure now that we’re back to the regular ranking system? How are you adapting to the tougher competition? Let’s share some tips and tricks to help each other out!
__label__1 Hey there, I'm a 38-year-old woman living in Virginia, and honestly, I'm feeling a bit lost lately. Life has been a whirlwind, and I could really use someone to talk to.

I also love a good book and am always on the lookout for recommendations.     If you’re in a similar boat or just want to share some laughs and stories, please reach out! I’d love to hear about your interests and what keeps you going. Let’s help each other navigate this crazy thing called life!

__label__0 Hello :)   So I’ve been playing with a team on a realm for Minecraft bedrock.   My teammates are incredible, but one person in specific had me questioning if they where legit, or if they where cheating.   This person managed to get a looting 2 sword and went to the nether.   They got 8 wither skulls in a matter of about 40 minutes. They have also gotten access to some really good items, so I am wondering if they are just super good at the game or if they aren’t being honest.    Personally I’ve never had that good of luck getting them even with looting 2,   I was wondering if anyone else has had that good of luck? Or is it possible they are cheating?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I just wanted to reach out because I haven’t slept properly for days and it’s really starting to take a toll on me. I’ve been feeling more irritable and my mood swings are all over the place. I know sleep is super important for managing bipolar disorder, but no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get a good night’s rest.    I’ve tried some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing and reading before bed, but nothing seems to work. I’m also worried that this lack of sleep might trigger a manic episode or worsen my depression.     Has anyone else experienced this? What strategies have you found helpful for getting back on track with sleep? I’d really appreciate any advice or support.     Thanks for listening!

__label__0 Hey guys. I am making an app for hijabi's only and i don't know what to add in there, so that's why I need your help. What do you hijabi's want in an app that's only for Muslim girls. Also boys will NOT be able to create an account for the app and with the safety features I'm gonna add there's no chance a boy will last on there. So it's an app for only Muslim girls. What I have in mind for the app is the girls could talk with each other and post stuff that is only for girls to see, so feel free to share your thoughts. All ideas will be appreciated and I'll try to add all of them if not most of them.    *I posted this on r/Muslim and they suggested this subreddit*

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m a total Broadway newbie and I’m looking to dive into the world of musical theater. I’ve heard so much about the magic of Broadway, but I’m not sure where to start when it comes to listening to cast recordings.     What are some of the best albums that you would recommend for someone just starting out? I’m open to all genres and styles, whether it’s classic shows or contemporary hits.     I’ve heard a lot about "Hamilton" and "Wicked," but I’d love to get your thoughts on other must-listen albums that really capture the essence of Broadway. Any hidden gems or personal favorites?     Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
__label__1 I'm looking for some great progression fantasy audiobooks to dive into. I love stories where the main character grows stronger over time, whether through training, leveling up, or gaining new abilities. If you have any recommendations, please share!     Some of my favorites include "The Land" series by Aleron Kong and "Awaken Online" by Travis Bagwell. I enjoy a mix of action, character development, and a well-built world.     If you know of any hidden gems or popular titles that fit this genre, I'd really appreciate your input! Thanks!
__label__0 Hey everyone,    I wanted to do something different than the common horizontal runs to and from the distroplate. Additionally I wanted to have the liquid hit a res before reaching each component. As I stated in the title, the loop barely drains... As in there will still be liquid in both reservoirs, the left half of the distro plate, and the cpu and gpu blocks. Gravity is not having any of my shit.    Loop order is as follows: top right fill &gt; pump (bottom left) &gt; bottom res &gt; GPU &gt; mid left distro &gt; top res &gt; CPU &gt; top left distro &gt; middle right (fill side) distro. The drain is the bottom most port on the right side, which also happens to be in the same section as the fill port and the returning liquid after completing the loop.    Haven't yet decided if I want to do hard tubing again, or go for some thick soft tubing with quick disconnects. Either way I'm going to deep clean it and re-order the loop when the new GPU's come out later this year. Also I have no idea why there is color bleed in the GPU block...    Hoping some more experienced folks can help me out!

__label__1 Navigating a relationship with someone who has experienced significant loss can be challenging, especially when there are children involved. Here are some thoughts on how to approach this situation:    1. **Be Understanding and Patient**: Recognize that she has gone through a traumatic experience with the loss of her partner. It’s important to be patient and understanding as she may still be processing her grief. Allow her to share her feelings at her own pace.    2. **Listen Actively**: When she talks about her experiences, listen without judgment. Show empathy and validate her feelings. Sometimes, just being there to listen can mean a lot.    3. **Respect Her Boundaries**: She may have certain boundaries when it comes to discussing her past or her daughter’s father. Be respectful of those boundaries and don’t push her to share more than she’s comfortable with.    4. **Be Supportive**: Offer your support in practical ways. This could mean helping her with her child, offering to babysit, or simply being there for her when she needs someone to talk to.     5. **Communicate Openly**: As your relationship develops, communicate openly about your feelings and intentions. It’s important to be clear about what you want from the relationship while also being sensitive to her situation.    6. **Take Things Slow**: Given her circumstances, it might be best to take things slow. Building trust and a strong foundation is crucial, especially when children are involved.    7. **Be Prepared for Challenges**: Understand that there may be challenges ahead, especially if she is still grieving. Be prepared to navigate those challenges together and be supportive.    8. **Encourage Self-Care**: Encourage her to take time for herself, whether that’s through hobbies, self-care routines, or spending time with friends. It’s important for her to have a support system outside of your relationship as well.    9. **Consider the Child’s Needs**: If your relationship progresses, think about how you can be a positive influence in her daughter’s life. Building a relationship with the child will take time and should be approached with care.    10. **Seek Guidance if Needed**: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or unsure about how to proceed, consider seeking advice from friends, family, or even a professional who can provide guidance on relationships involving loss and parenting.    Ultimately, the key is to approach the situation with compassion and understanding. Building a relationship with someone who has experienced loss requires sensitivity, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.
__label__1 I'm working on an inventory management spreadsheet in Excel and I have a couple of questions regarding formulas that I hope someone can help me with.    1. **Calculating Total Inventory Value**: I have a list of products with their quantities in one column and their unit prices in another. What formula can I use to calculate the total inventory value? For example, if Quantity is in column A and Unit Price is in column B, how would I write the formula to get the total value in column C?    2. **Tracking Stock Levels**: I want to create a formula that alerts me when stock levels fall below a certain threshold. For instance, if I want to be alerted when the quantity in column A is less than 10, how can I set this up? Is there a way to use conditional formatting to highlight these cells?    3. **Calculating Reorder Quantity**: If I want to calculate how much stock I need to reorder based on current stock levels and a desired stock level, what formula would I use? For example, if I want to maintain a stock level of 50 units and I currently have 20, how can I calculate the reorder quantity?    Any help with these questions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

__label__0 Hello Thinkpad enthusiasts,    I recently purchased an M.2 2242 SSD for my Thinkpad T470p and installed it on the WWAN slot. However, it being a WWAN slot, there were wires for the WWAN module. Is this placement of wires safe enough? Will I end up melting the wires from laptop heat with this setup? Will it cause any future potential trouble?    I was thinking of placing a 1TB mSATA 860 EVO via an adapter to that slot, but it was out of stock. In hindsight, I wouldn't be too comfy with how much larger it would be since that setup would have had some slight contact with the WiFi card.     https://preview.redd.it/skju3o44z9q51.jpg?width=3150&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=887f8c34fd52133a3e40733dd94f05cbeec2f926    Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I’m currently going to gender therapy on Tuesdays to lead up to eventually HRT (hormone replacement therapy) (note: I am a ftm trans guy, he/him pronouns please). My second telehealth meeting was 2 days ago and after the meeting I had a break through.    My dad has been gaslighting and emotionally manipulating me for years. I can never talk about how I feel or the things he’s doing without him saying “you’re taking it the wrong way” and accusing me of twisting his words. He tells me I’m the one whose misunderstanding the situation and tries to make it seem like he’s not in the wrong. He plays the victim and mocks me. I told him as a 12-13 yo that he makes me feel like I never do anything right, and since then he makes fun of it, saying in a joking/sarcastic tone that I make him feel like he never does anything right then gets mad when I get upset. On top of all of this he doesn’t believe in therapy or medication and so I wasn’t even able to talk to someone until a month ago when I found a gender therapist and I could pay on my own since I got a job back in April. I’m 17 now and he still keeps this up.    And my mom was someone I trusted, someone who I’d go to about things like this, but sometimes she does/says really shitty things that just make me feel worse. I experienced a traumatic event when I was younger that has lead me to have severe separation anxiety when it comes to my mom. My mom admitted two days ago that she says and does things trying to get me to hate her so that I’ll “feel more comfortable leaving” when I go off to college.     And it’s taken me so long to admit that both my parents are abusive. It was a word I’d dance around because my dad constantly told me I was taking things the wrong way. This caused me to question everything I felt. And I didn’t even realize this is what was happening. When I talk about my parents and the family dynamic I always feel like I have to dance around so many aspects of my life because I’m afraid of what people will think. For the longest time I was afraid of someone saying that my parents are abusive. I was afraid of being taking from my home, especially when the rest of my family is extremely homo/transphobic. Even now with my therapist I try to dance around the issues. I only have a year left in this house, I don’t want to be pulled out of it and have no control over my own situation (where I go, etc.).    It makes it worse because people think my family life is decent (not good but decent). I’m able to go to gender therapy and my mom is so accepting and my parents let me dress however and do pretty much whatever I want. But I dance around the issue so much that they don’t see what happens at home. They don’t see that I can’t believe either of my parents because they’ve lied to me so much. They don’t see that my dad has been manipulating me from a young age so I don’t trust what I think/feel anymore. They don’t see that my parents do all of these wrong things and just say “well I’m not perfect” but when I mess up I “should know better” and I’m expecting to improve while they stay the same.     People in my GSA treat me like I have it so good, just because I’m out to my parents and I’m doing all these good things. But what they don’t see is that all of these things I’ve done on my own. I bought my own binder, I’ve been cutting my own hair, I contacted the gender therapist and wouldn’t stop bothering my mom until she took me. My mom questioned my identity for 4 years before she even agreed that I might be trans, and she still doesn’t use the right pronouns. And my dad thinks it’s either a) somehow his fault for not being home as much as he “should have” or b) my moms fault for telling me she would rather have a boy than a girl (to that I say I absolutely never remember her saying that and my dad could absolutely be lying because he’s done that MANY times before).     I’m so tired of people thinking I have it easier or that my life is so great because of what they see at school and how I act. I feel like I can never complain because “someone always has it worse.” (CW SELF HARM MENTIONED: By the way, that is what my mom told me when she found my cuts when I was 12.)
__label__1 I've been struggling with keeping my commitments lately, and I wanted to share my thoughts and seek advice from this community. It seems like every time I make a promise to myself or to others, I end up breaking it. Whether it's sticking to a workout routine, completing a project on time, or even just following through on small tasks, I find myself making excuses and letting things slide.    I understand that keeping one's word is crucial for building trust and maintaining relationships, but I often feel overwhelmed by my own expectations and the pressure I put on myself. I want to be someone who is reliable and disciplined, but I keep falling short.    Here are a few things I've been considering to improve my ability to keep my word:  1. **Setting realistic goals**: I think I need to start small and gradually build up my commitments instead of overwhelming myself with too many promises at once.  2. **Accountability**: I’m thinking about finding an accountability partner or joining a group where we can check in on each other’s progress.  3. **Reflecting on my motivations**: I want to understand why I make certain commitments and whether they align with my values and priorities.    I would love to hear your thoughts on this. How do you stay disciplined and ensure that you keep your word? Any tips or strategies that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I have a bunch of ideas for quilts, but I don't want to just hoard 30 quilts in a bin in my basement. I also have no intention of trying to sell them, and I only have so many people in my life who want/need any quilts. I love the idea of donating them to someone/somewhere, but I don't want to just drop it off at goodwill for them to sell it. What do y'all do with extra quilts?
__label__0 So I promised to post as I was doing my treatment. Just a quick summary: I presumably contracted the Virus 6 months ago, was finally diagnosed with CFS this month.    The treatment I set down with my doctor is as following: I'm taking a small dosis of vitamin B12 three times a day. I get up at 7:30 every morning and go for a long walk, during the day I excercize regularly ( I do pullups, though my doctor said that was overdoing it ). I eat an extremly low carb diet, which i supplement with some additional fibre. I take Vitamin D daily. No more eating after 19:00 and I go to bed at 23:00.    Progress has been going well. The doctor said the timecycle was to align my acitivity with the "cortisol axis", basically certain hormons are produced with the cycle of the sun and he felt it's important to align my schedule to that ( which was very hard for me, as I'm more the nocturnal type, but it does feel like it's making a difference ). My symptoms have been steadily decreasing. Most physical symptoms are gone now. What lingers around is a strong feeling of being tired and brainfog, mostly when I sit still. The real improvement is that even with physical acitvity I don't flare up anymore. I don't expect my state to improve quickly form here on out, but overall I have to say I've made huge steps towards a full recovery and I do feel like the treatment helps.

__label__1 After watching the latest episodes, I’ve come to realize just how pivotal Kim is in Jimmy’s transformation into Saul Goodman. It’s fascinating to see how their relationship has evolved and how it has influenced Jimmy’s moral compass.     In the earlier seasons, Kim was a grounding force for Jimmy, often encouraging him to do the right thing and reminding him of his potential. However, as their relationship has become more complicated, especially with the events of the last few seasons, it feels like Kim has inadvertently pushed Jimmy further into the Saul persona.     The way she navigates her own moral dilemmas, especially in the courtroom, seems to mirror Jimmy’s descent into the darker side of the law. It’s almost as if they are two sides of the same coin—while Kim tries to maintain her integrity, Jimmy is slipping further away from his.     I think the moment that really solidified this for me was in the episode where Kim decides to go along with the plan to sabotage Howard. It’s a turning point that shows how far they’ve both strayed from their original paths. Kim’s willingness to engage in unethical behavior seems to give Jimmy the green light to fully embrace his alter ego.     It’s heartbreaking to see how their love story has become intertwined with their moral decay. I can’t help but wonder if there’s a way back for either of them, or if they are both destined to be consumed by their choices.     What do you all think? Is Kim the catalyst for Jimmy’s transformation, or is it more about his own choices? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 Hello everyone!     I wanted to spark a discussion about a hypothetical scenario regarding drug legalization. Imagine there’s a substance that provides the same euphoric and relaxing effects as alcohol, but without any of the negative physical side effects, such as liver damage, addiction potential, or carcinogenic risks. Would you support the legalization of such a drug?     I think this raises some interesting points about our current views on substances. On one hand, it could potentially reduce the health risks associated with alcohol consumption, which is a significant issue in many societies. On the other hand, would it lead to increased usage or dependency, even if it’s physically safer?     Additionally, how do you think this would affect social norms around drinking? Would it replace alcohol in social settings, or would it coexist?     I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this! Would you personally use such a substance if it were legal? What do you think the implications would be for society as a whole?     Looking forward to your insights!

__label__0 Hello! I’ve been drumming for about three years now but I have been very poor at practicing but now I’m finally going to actually get back into it. I have a couple of questions since my drum set is not the quality I want it to be. Firstly, whenever I play the hi hat with my foot, I find that every time the cymbals will slightly touch causing unwanted sound. Also, I find the bass drum is not giving a good bounce with the pedal. Any advice?
__label__1 I've been playing Plants vs. Zombies 1 again after a long break, and I'm stuck on the final level of Adventure mode! I keep getting overwhelmed by the zombies, especially the Gargantuars and the Balloon Zombies.     I've tried different plant combinations, but I can't seem to find a strategy that works. I usually go with Sunflowers, Peashooters, and Wall-nuts, but I feel like I need something more effective.     Does anyone have tips or a specific plant setup that helped them beat the last level? Also, any advice on how to manage my sun production better would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I recently had a DMT experience that left me feeling confused and a bit unsettled. I prepared everything carefully, followed the dosage guidelines, and set a comfortable environment. However, when I took the hit, I felt an immediate rush, but instead of the usual vibrant visuals and profound insights, I was met with a heavy, oppressive darkness.     At first, I thought it was just the onset, but as the experience progressed, I felt like I was trapped in a void. There were no colors, no entities, just an overwhelming sense of dread. I tried to focus on my breath and remind myself that it was just the substance, but it felt like I was being pulled deeper into this abyss.     I remember thinking, "This isn’t right. Where are the fractals? Where are the messages?" It was as if I was being blocked from accessing the usual realms of DMT. I even had a fleeting thought that maybe I had encountered some kind of barrier or entity that was preventing me from experiencing the full journey.     After what felt like an eternity, the experience finally subsided, and I was left feeling shaken. I’ve had positive experiences before, so I’m trying to understand what went wrong this time. Was it the setting? My mindset? Or perhaps the dosage was off? I’d love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any insights on what might have happened.

__label__1 I’m feeling really scared right now and I just need to vent a little. I’ve been questioning my identity and my feelings lately, and it’s been overwhelming. I’ve always identified as gay, but recently I’ve found myself attracted to someone who identifies as non-binary. It’s not that I’m against it or anything, but it’s just throwing me for a loop.     I’m worried about how my friends and family will react if I start dating this person. I’ve always been open about my sexuality, but this feels different. I don’t want to feel like I’m betraying my identity or confusing myself even more.     On top of that, I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression, and this whole situation is just making it worse. I feel like I’m in a constant state of fear about what others will think and how I’ll be perceived.     Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you handle it? I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin and not be scared of who I am or who I might love. Any advice or support would be really appreciated.
__label__1 I've been feeling really paranoid lately, and it's starting to affect my daily life. It feels like I'm constantly on edge, worrying about what others think of me or if something bad is going to happen. I find myself overthinking situations and imagining the worst possible outcomes.     For example, when I'm out in public, I feel like people are staring at me or judging me, even when I know that's probably not the case. I also get anxious about social interactions, and I often avoid situations where I might have to talk to new people.     I've tried to talk to friends about it, but they don't seem to understand how overwhelming it can be. I don't want to burden them with my worries, but I also feel like I need some support.     Has anyone else experienced this kind of paranoia? How did you cope with it? Should I consider talking to a professional about it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've seen this username pop up everywhere on Reddit, especially in some of the more popular subreddits, and I can't help but wonder who they are. They seem to have a huge following and get a lot of upvotes, but I have no idea what makes them so special. Are they a meme creator, a prolific commenter, or just someone who knows how to stir the pot? I feel like I'm missing out on some inside joke or something. Can anyone fill me in on who u/GallowBoob is and why they're so well-known?
__label__1 I recently started a new job, and while I’m excited about the opportunity, I’m finding it challenging to navigate the workplace dynamics. My team is quite diverse, and I feel like I’m struggling to connect with my colleagues. I often find myself feeling left out during conversations and team activities, which makes me anxious about going to work each day.    I want to build better relationships with my coworkers, but I’m not sure how to approach them without coming off as awkward or intrusive. I’ve tried joining in on discussions, but I often feel like I don’t have much to contribute, especially since I’m still learning the ropes of my role.    Additionally, I’ve noticed that some team members seem to have established cliques, which makes it even harder for me to feel included. I don’t want to force friendships, but I also don’t want to feel isolated at work.     Does anyone have advice on how to break the ice and foster connections with coworkers? Are there specific strategies or conversation starters that have worked for you in similar situations? Any tips on how to feel more comfortable in a new work environment would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been diving into some of the story modes exclusive to PS4, and I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on which one stands out the most. For me, I think "God of War" takes the cake. The character development of Kratos and Atreus is phenomenal, and the Norse mythology setting adds a fresh twist to the series. The emotional depth and the bond between father and son really hit home.    However, I’ve also heard great things about "The Last of Us Part II" and its gripping narrative. The way it tackles themes of revenge and loss is incredibly powerful, and the gameplay mechanics are top-notch.    What do you all think? Which PS4 exclusive story mode do you believe is the best and why? Let’s hear your opinions!

__label__0 Hiya!    I'm looking for a semi-lit to literate roleplay partner who'd like to write in the Naruto universe. Please be open to AUs as well as canon and non--canon events/relationships. I'm looking to write in the third person, first is not suited for this type of story-telling.    Action and Relationships should go hand-in-hand in these stories. They will be collaborative efforts, so OOC plotting may happen in between replies.    Here is a sample of scenarios I'm looking to write, I have other ideas and I'm also interested in coming up with one with you that's unrelated to these:    **Naruto:**    * Through a twist of fate Ino Yamanaka and Sakura Haruno are switched from Team 10 and Team 7 the day before squad selection. How will things change when Team Kakashi consists of Naruto, Sasuke and Ino?  * What if Naruto's actions that led to Sakura's rescue from Gaara's rampage opened her eyes to the blonde in a way she never expected? Naruto's rapid increase in power and determination starts to charm her. Though nothing happened before Naruto left the village, he returns home two and a half years later. Taller, stronger and as cheerful as ever, Sakura now has to deal with the fact that she has a crush on not one, but two of her old teammates.  * Tenten never considered going out on a date with a Naruto before, but after a training session with Team 7, he went right ahead and asked the Leaf's resident weapons master if she wanted to share a meal at his favorite ramen spot. It wasn't even a date, but now she can't stop thinking about Naruto, ever! Will Tenten ever cure herself of this madness?  * Near the end of his three year training trip with the Sannin, Jiraiya, Naruto Uzumaki is attacked by a group of shinobi belonging to the Hidden Stone village. While the Sannin and Jinchuriki were able to dispatch most of their assailants, one particularly loud one was spared and captured. Kurotsuchi was brought back to the Hidden Leaf by the very two she had set out to kill. Becoming a prisoner kept by the Leaf, but granted some clemency in order to keep the peace, can a relationship build between the Tsuchikage's granddaughter and the son of her homeland's greatest enemy?  * The Hidden Leaf and Hidden Sand come to an agreement after the Sand's betrayal during the Chunin Exams. The two villages will forge an arranged marriage between the son of the Fourth Hokage and the daughter of the Fourth Kazekage. The thing is, Naruto Uzumaki doesn't learn of this until after he returns from his training trip!  * After the mission to rescue Sasuke fails, Kakashi finds the unconscious body of Tayuya of the North Gate. He carries her back to the Hidden Leaf along with Naruto in order to interrogate her. Though after recovering, Naruto takes a shine to the foul-mouthed kunoichi, and is able to get her a better deal than she ever could've hoped for. What happens when he returns to the Hidden Leaf two and a half years later?

__label__1 After 29 years of living in a body that never felt like mine, I finally took the leap and came out as a transgender woman. It’s been a long and winding road filled with self-doubt, fear, and a lot of soul-searching. I spent so many years trying to fit into the mold that society expected of me, but deep down, I always knew that I was meant to be someone else.    The decision to come out wasn’t easy. I had to confront my own fears about rejection and acceptance, not just from my family and friends, but also from myself. I remember the first time I told my best friend; I was shaking and terrified. But her reaction was overwhelmingly supportive, and it gave me the courage to keep going.    Since then, I’ve started hormone replacement therapy, and I can already see and feel changes in my body that make me so happy. I’ve also begun to explore my style and how I want to present myself to the world. It’s liberating to finally wear clothes that reflect who I am inside.    I know that this journey is just beginning, and there will be challenges ahead, but I feel more alive than ever. I’m excited to embrace my true self and to finally live authentically. I wanted to share this milestone with all of you because I know many of you have been through similar experiences. Thank you for being such a supportive community. Here’s to new beginnings!

__label__1 I remember seeing a discussion about universally flattering pants from J.Crew and Banana Republic, and I think I can help!     For J.Crew, the **Crosby Pant** is often mentioned as a great option. It has a tailored fit that works well for various body types and is made from a stretchy fabric that provides comfort while still looking polished. They come in different lengths and colors, which makes them versatile for both casual and more formal occasions.    On the other hand, from Banana Republic, the **Sloan Pant** is frequently recommended. These pants have a sleek, straight-leg silhouette that flatters many shapes and sizes. They also come in a variety of fabrics, including some that are more structured and others that are softer, so you can choose based on your comfort preference.    Both options are great for creating a chic look, and you can easily dress them up or down depending on the occasion. If you’re looking for something that can transition from work to weekend, these are definitely worth checking out!     Has anyone else tried these pants? Would love to hear your thoughts or any other recommendations!
__label__1 With the recent acquisition of ZeniMax Media by Microsoft, I can't help but wonder what this means for the future of the Fallout franchise. As a long-time fan, I have mixed feelings about this development. On one hand, having the backing of a tech giant like Microsoft could lead to better funding and resources for future games, potentially resulting in higher quality titles. On the other hand, I worry about the direction the series might take under a corporate umbrella.    Will we see more focus on multiplayer experiences, like Fallout 76, or will they return to the single-player storytelling that made the series so beloved? And what about modding support? Bethesda has always had a strong modding community, and I hope that Microsoft will continue to support that aspect.    What do you all think? Are you excited about the potential changes, or do you have concerns about the future of Fallout under Microsoft? Let's discuss!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm on day 8 of my fasting journey and wanted to check in with the community.     So far, I’ve been doing a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, and I have to say, I’m feeling pretty good! The first few days were a bit challenging as I adjusted to the new eating pattern, but now I feel more energized and focused. I’ve noticed that my cravings have significantly decreased, and I’m no longer constantly thinking about food like I used to.     I’ve been trying to make the most of my eating window by focusing on whole, nutrient-dense foods. Lots of veggies, lean proteins, and healthy fats. I’ve also been drinking plenty of water and herbal teas to stay hydrated.     One thing I’ve found helpful is keeping myself busy during fasting hours. I’ve picked up some new hobbies, like reading and learning to play the guitar, which has really helped distract me from any thoughts of snacking.     I’m curious to hear from others who are also on their fasting journey. How are you all doing? Any tips or experiences you’d like to share? Let’s keep supporting each other!

__label__1 I've noticed that many female clothes tend to be more comfortable than male clothes, and I'm curious about why that is. For instance, women's clothing often incorporates softer fabrics, looser fits, and more stretchy materials. Things like leggings, flowy dresses, and oversized sweaters seem to prioritize comfort without sacrificing style.     On the other hand, men's clothing often feels more rigid and structured, with less variety in terms of fabric choices. Why do you think this is the case? Is it a matter of fashion trends, societal expectations, or something else entirely?     I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this! Do you think comfort in clothing is prioritized differently for men and women? And if so, why do you think that is?
__label__1 I've been eyeing the Alpinestars J6 boots for a while now, and I'm curious about their protective features. I know they have a stylish design and are marketed as a good blend of comfort and protection for urban riding, but do they really offer substantial protection compared to more traditional motorcycle boots?    From what I've gathered, they have a reinforced toe box, heel counter, and some ankle protection, which is a step up from regular sneakers. However, I’m wondering how they hold up in a real-world scenario.     For those who own a pair or have experience with them, how do you feel about their protection level? Have you had any close calls or accidents while wearing them? Would you recommend them for daily riding, or should I be looking for something more robust?     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about what a new society could look like, especially with all the issues we face today. Here are some ideas I came up with:    1. **Sustainability First**: Our society would prioritize sustainability in every aspect. Renewable energy sources would be the norm, and we’d focus on reducing waste and recycling. Urban areas would have green spaces, vertical gardens, and community farms to promote local food production.    2. **Education for All**: Education would be free and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. The curriculum would focus on critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, rather than just standardized testing. We’d also have mentorship programs connecting students with professionals in various fields.    3. **Universal Basic Income**: To combat poverty and provide a safety net, everyone would receive a universal basic income. This would allow people to pursue their passions, start businesses, or invest in their education without the constant stress of financial insecurity.    4. **Community-Centric Living**: Neighborhoods would be designed to foster community interaction. There would be communal spaces for gatherings, events, and activities. People would be encouraged to participate in local decision-making processes, making everyone feel more connected and invested in their community.    5. **Mental Health Awareness**: Mental health would be treated with the same importance as physical health. There would be free access to mental health resources, and schools would incorporate mental health education into their programs. Stigma around mental health would be actively challenged.    6. **Diversity and Inclusion**: Our society would celebrate diversity in all forms. Policies would be in place to ensure representation and inclusion of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. Everyone would have a voice and a place in society.    7. **Tech for Good**: Technology would be used to enhance our lives, not control us. We’d focus on ethical tech development, ensuring privacy and security for everyone. Innovations would aim to solve social issues rather than just profit.    What do you all think? What would you add or change? Let’s brainstorm together!
__label__1 Imagine this: you’re playing through Undertale for the first time, and you’ve just reached the point where you have to choose between sparing or fighting Sans. You’ve heard all the hype about how difficult his battle is, but you’re determined to see it through. You’ve been playing a pacifist run, and you want to see if you can spare him too.    As you enter the battle, the music starts playing, and you feel a rush of adrenaline. The dialogue is witty and sharp, and you can’t help but chuckle at Sans’ jokes, even as you’re sweating bullets trying to dodge his attacks. You remember the advice you read on this subreddit about staying calm and focusing on the patterns, but it’s hard to concentrate when the stakes feel so high.    After a few attempts, you finally manage to get through his attacks without taking too much damage. You’re on the edge of your seat, heart racing, as you finally reach the point where you can spare him. You hit the button, and the screen flashes with the message that you’ve spared Sans.     But then, instead of the usual victory screen, you’re met with a somber moment. Sans looks at you, and you can feel the weight of his words as he talks about the inevitability of fate and how he’s tired of fighting. It hits you hard, and you realize that this isn’t just a game anymore; it’s a story about choices, consequences, and the bonds we form.    You finish the game, and as the credits roll, you can’t help but reflect on the journey you’ve taken. The characters, the choices, the emotions—it all feels so real. You close the game, but the experience lingers with you.     Have any of you had a similar moment in your playthrough? What choices did you make that impacted you the most? Let’s share our experiences!
__label__1 I just had the most awkward encounter with my crush and I can't stop cringing! 😳 So, I was at the mall with my friends, and I spotted him at a store. I thought, "Okay, this is my chance!" So I gathered all my courage and walked over to say hi.     But as I approached, I tripped over my own feet and almost fell into a rack of clothes! I managed to catch myself, but I was so embarrassed. He looked at me with this mix of concern and amusement, and I just blurted out, "I was just testing the floor for you!" Like, what even is that?!     He laughed, and I could feel my face turning bright red. We ended up chatting for a few minutes, but I was so flustered that I could barely form a coherent sentence. I think I might have even asked him about his favorite type of cheese? 😩     Now I’m just sitting here wondering if I totally ruined my chances or if he found it cute. Ugh, why is being a teenager so complicated? Anyone else have a super embarrassing crush story? I need to know I'm not alone in this!

__label__0 I’m calling myself a career magpie.  I say career, I’m a self employed consultant so the blessing/curse is that I can do loads of different, unrelated side hustles and call them all “consulting” but why on earth can’t I focus on something?    I go on vacation, by the end of the flight I want to train as a pilot.  By the end of my week, I want to get a job working on a resort.  I go to Disney World, I’m browsing job openings at Disney World.  I watch TV, I start reading books on how to break into TV.    Why can’t I just enjoy stuff without this urge to “get involved” - and it’s not always an urge either, I’ve taken temp jobs before at random places just because I fancied finding out what it would be like to work there.    I’m almost 40, I have a daughter, I feel like this is the time I should be focussing, moving up the ladder, building some security but my focus/desire/drive changes on the daily depending on what I’ve done most recently.    Any advice appreciated!
__label__0 Is there anyway for me to transfer my Nintendo switch save of BOI to Xbox One
__label__1 I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for five years. Lately, our relationship has been strained due to his increasing emotional distance and lack of communication. He has been spending more time with his friends and less time at home, which has left me feeling neglected and unappreciated.     A few weeks ago, after a particularly rough week where he forgot my birthday and didn’t even acknowledge it, I confronted him about how I was feeling. Instead of having a mature conversation, he got defensive and accused me of being overly dramatic. This led to a huge argument where I expressed that I felt like I was living with a roommate rather than a partner.     In a moment of frustration, I told him that I needed space and that he should leave the house for a while to think about what he wants. He reluctantly agreed and moved in with a friend. Since then, I’ve had time to reflect on our relationship and what I want moving forward.     However, I’ve also been feeling really hurt and angry about how he has treated me. I’ve been considering telling his family about the situation, as they have always been supportive of our marriage and I think they would want to know what’s going on. I’m worried that this might escalate things further and create more drama, but I also feel like they deserve to know how their son is treating his wife.     So, AITA for kicking my husband out of the house? And WIBTA if I told his family about our issues?

__label__0 Meditation, book 1, v16    “And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them.”    How to use this in the journey of wanting what you have and not wanting what you don’t?     And is want different from desire in this verse?
__label__0 Hello :) I need some financial advice from you guys!    Im currently 21 years old and make 2.7k Every other week (this is take home money after taxes)    My current expenses are (monthly)    Phone - 75    Car - 330    Car Insurance - 250    Food - 250    Fortunately my company pays for my rent as they have me travel and move constantly.    I currently have a 2500 Personal Loan that im expected to pay back by the end of september    My car loan has a remaining balance of 9,674 at 21% interest (ik its very high, i dont have family and urgently needed a car when i was 18, my payments have been on time and i always paid more then my loan had me and have paid 871 in interest as of today. i have told my self that i would pay it off, i do not have any desire to sell it and have already been denied for refinance)    My question is what is the best way for me to pay off my debt. Should i be aggressive with it? I also want to have money saved up in case something comes up(or should i not worry about this until i pay my car off?). I was talking with a friend of mine about his car loan and after his 5 years he paid a total of 6k in interest and that number freaked me out i would much rather knock it out quicker and get ready to invest that money into my future. but i do understand that its a process. I've had the last 3 months off of work due to covid and completely burnt through my saved up money due to a series of unfortunate events, and am sitting on just about 500$. I just started working again and want to make sure I am doing everything right. Any and all advice is welcome.

__label__1 I'm trying to get in touch with the IRS regarding a tax issue, but I've been struggling to reach them by phone and I really don't want to deal with the hassle of sending a letter through the mail. Are there any other options available for contacting the IRS?     I've heard about the IRS website and the online tools they offer, but I'm not sure if I can get direct assistance through those channels. Can anyone share their experiences or suggest any alternative methods to contact the IRS, such as email, online chat, or secure messaging through their website?     Thanks in advance for your help!

Does anyone know if this is in the works?

__label__1 I wanted to share my latest piece titled "Ti" which I created using acrylics in 2022. This artwork is a reflection of my journey as an artist and the emotions I experienced during that time. I aimed to capture a sense of movement and energy through vibrant colors and dynamic brush strokes.     The piece is inspired by the concept of transformation and the beauty of change. I hope it resonates with you as much as it does with me. I would love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!     Here’s a close-up of the details and textures I incorporated. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work!

__label__1 Alright fellow degenerates, it’s that time of year again! September is notorious for being a rough month for the markets, and I’m ready to hit the snooze button until October rolls around.     Every year, it feels like September is the month where all the bad news comes out to play. Earnings reports, economic data, and let’s not forget the seasonal sell-off that seems to happen like clockwork.     But here’s the kicker: October has historically been a month of recovery and even some epic rallies. So, I’m putting my bets on the fact that we’ll see some sweet gains once we wake up from this September slumber.     In the meantime, I’m stacking up on some options and keeping my eyes peeled for any juicy dips. Who else is ready to ride the wave into October? Let’s get those diamond hands ready and hold on tight! HODL or DCA, what’s your strategy?     Wake me up when September ends, but until then, let’s keep the memes and the gains coming!
__label__1 I've been playing MC Eternal for a while now, and I've run into a rather interesting situation regarding perpetual daylight on my server. I initially thought it was a bug, but after some investigation, I believe it might be related to a combination of mods and settings.    Here's what I've noticed:    1. **Daylight Cycle Disabled**: I checked the server settings and confirmed that the daylight cycle is indeed disabled. This was done to prevent mobs from spawning at night, but it seems to have created a permanent day effect.     2. **Mods Interaction**: I suspect that certain mods in MC Eternal, like the "Time in a Bottle" mod or any time manipulation mods, might be affecting the day-night cycle. I’ve seen some players mention that using these mods can lead to unexpected behavior with the time settings.    3. **Server Commands**: I also experimented with commands like `/gamerule doDaylightCycle false` and `/time set day`, which seemed to reinforce the perpetual daylight. However, I’m not sure if there’s a way to revert this without resetting the server.    4. **Player Feedback**: Some players on my server actually enjoy the constant daylight, as it makes exploring and building much easier. However, others miss the challenge of nighttime mobs and the aesthetic of a night sky.    **Questions for the Community:**  - Has anyone else experienced this issue with MC Eternal?   - Is there a way to toggle the daylight cycle back on without losing progress?  - Are there specific mods that are known to interfere with the day-night cycle?    I’d love to hear your thoughts and any solutions you might have! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I am in the finance field and currently getting my series 7. Need some guidance here.     Company A is paying me $20.75 while in training/licensing, then once I’m out, they pay an extra dollar an hour, so $21.75.   Company A also has a clause that says I need to work there for a year or I may have to pay back the costs of training (I know they usually do not pursue this if you leave on good terms. This is a highly reputable company, not “mom and pops financial guidance”.     Company B is a company my brother has worked for for 20 years and his good friend reached out to bring me on. Company B is offering $65,000-$75,000 (so low end: $31.25/hour) for the same role, HOWEVER; it is a Financial Advisory program (that is end goal for me) and it lasts about a year and a half. Company B also has much better benefits.     Company A is currently going through an acquisition, it is being acquired by another company, so promotions will be far and few between until full transition is complete (circa 2024), especially in the area I want to go in as we don’t know if the new company will keep the same departments.     My question is: take the jump for higher pay, and a reputable source saying they are a better company to work for? Or stick with company A even though the pay is honestly disrespectful for a fully licensed financial professional, and see where I can go with company A?

__label__1 Welcome to the match thread for Day 2 of the final round of the Bob Willis Trophy!     After an exciting Day 1, where we saw some brilliant performances from both batters and bowlers, the stakes are high as teams vie for the title.     **Current Standings:**    - Team A: 250 all out    - Team B: 150/5      **Key Performers from Day 1:**    - Player X from Team A scored a fantastic century, anchoring the innings.    - Player Y from Team B has been impressive with the ball, taking 3 wickets and putting Team A under pressure.      **What to Watch for Today:**    - Can Team B chase down the target? They need a solid partnership to stabilize their innings.    - Will Team A's bowlers continue to dominate? Look out for Player Z, who has been in great form lately.      Feel free to share your thoughts, predictions, and any live updates as the day unfolds! Let's keep the discussion going and enjoy the cricket!
__label__0 This is a long shot, of course.     I'm paying Comcast for 600/15.    I have yet to get more than 90/15.    Hours working with them, they insist there is no reason for me not to get the full bandwidth, and lay the blame on the UDM Pro.    So - long shot - is there some magic setting in UDM Pro I'm missing that would throttle / limit my throughput? I have my Settings / Internet / General thresholds set accordingly, but I don't think they are any kind of throttle.    All my hard wiring is Cat6. I'm running speedtest from the dashboard, and every connected / wireless device in my network, getting the same 90/15 everywhere.

__label__1 As a woman in my mid-twenties, I’ve thought about this a lot! I think the oldest I would consider hooking up with is around 35. It’s not just about age, but also about maturity and life experience. I feel like at that age, a guy is usually more settled in his career and knows what he wants in life, which can be attractive.     However, I also think it depends on the individual. If I meet someone who is 40 but has a youthful spirit and shares similar interests, I might be open to it. On the flip side, if a guy is 30 but acts immature, that could be a turn-off.     What about you all? How do you feel about age gaps in dating? What’s the oldest you would hook up with?

__label__1 Blackmailing yourself might sound a bit strange, but it can actually be a useful technique for self-discipline and motivation. The idea is to create a system of consequences that you impose on yourself if you fail to meet your goals or commitments. Here’s how you can effectively implement this strategy:    1. **Set Clear Goals**: Start by defining what you want to achieve. Whether it’s losing weight, studying for an exam, or sticking to a workout routine, be specific about your goals.    2. **Identify Consequences**: Think of consequences that would genuinely motivate you to stay on track. This could be anything from donating money to a cause you don’t support, giving up a favorite activity, or even sharing your failure publicly on social media.    3. **Create a Contract**: Write a contract with yourself outlining your goals and the consequences of not meeting them. Be clear about what you will do if you fail. This makes it more tangible and serious.    4. **Set Checkpoints**: Establish regular intervals to check your progress. This could be weekly or monthly, depending on your goals. At each checkpoint, evaluate whether you’ve met your commitments.    5. **Be Honest**: When you assess your progress, be brutally honest with yourself. If you haven’t met your goals, follow through with the consequences you set. This is crucial for building self-discipline.    6. **Adjust as Needed**: If you find that your goals are too ambitious or your consequences are not motivating enough, don’t hesitate to adjust them. The key is to find a balance that works for you.    7. **Celebrate Success**: On the flip side, if you meet your goals, reward yourself! This positive reinforcement will help you stay motivated and committed.    Remember, the goal of this exercise is not to punish yourself but to create a system that encourages you to stay disciplined and focused on your objectives. It’s about building a stronger sense of accountability to yourself.
__label__1 I'm on the hunt for some visually stunning Android games that really push the limits of mobile graphics. I love games that have detailed environments, impressive character models, and overall high-quality graphics.     Some of my recent favorites include Genshin Impact and Call of Duty: Mobile, but I'm looking for more options to explore. If you have any recommendations for games that not only look great but also have engaging gameplay, I'd love to hear them!     Thanks in advance, Android gaming community!

__label__0 Howdy y'all,     I am once again asking for your contribution. So I have a Umarex G19x that I got months ago. Love it. I think I made a post about customizing slides some time ago too. I am now here to ask if anyone knows where I might be able to get my hands on a custom slide with an RMR cut? (Not JK Army, the one on their site is always sold out). Anything helps. Heck even info on who could be willing to make one for me for money. Everyone I've talked to so far denies me because it's not a real steel glock. Anyway thanks.    TL:DR; Where can I get a g19x umarex rmr slide cut?
__label__1 Acceptance can be one of the most challenging aspects of our spiritual and psychic journeys. I’ve been grappling with this lately, especially when it comes to accepting the things I cannot change in my life. It feels like I’m constantly fighting against the current, trying to control outcomes that are beyond my reach.    I’ve noticed that my psychic abilities seem to be affected by this struggle. When I’m in a state of resistance, my intuition feels clouded, and I find it hard to connect with my guides or receive clear messages. It’s as if the energy I’m putting out is blocking the flow of information that I need.    I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness and meditation to help me find a sense of peace and acceptance. I remind myself that everything happens for a reason, even if I can’t see it right now. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this and what techniques you’ve found helpful in fostering acceptance in your life. How do you navigate the balance between wanting to change your circumstances and accepting them as they are?     I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!
__label__1 I recently checked my Pokémon storage and found a shiny Gyarados that I caught over a year ago. My friend told me that having a shiny, especially one like Gyarados, is pretty lucky and valuable. I’m a very casual player, so I didn’t think much of it at the time.     I’ve been wondering if I should finally evolve it or power it up. I know Gyarados can be a strong Pokémon in battles, but I’m not sure if it’s worth investing in since I don’t play competitively.     Is it really that good? Should I evolve it just for the sake of having a shiny Mega Gyarados? Or should I keep it as is since it’s been sitting in my box for so long? Any advice from you all would be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been thinking about how to run a D&D campaign with two DMs, and I wanted to get some input from the community on how this could work effectively.     The idea came to me when I was discussing with a friend who is also a DM. We both have different styles and strengths, and I thought it might be interesting to combine our efforts to create a more dynamic experience for our players.     Here are a few ideas I had:    1. **Split Responsibilities**: One DM could focus on the narrative and world-building, while the other handles combat and encounters. This way, we can each play to our strengths and keep the game flowing smoothly.    2. **Dual Perspectives**: Each DM could take on different factions or NPCs within the same world. This would allow for richer storytelling, as players could interact with multiple viewpoints and motivations, making the world feel more alive.    3. **Tag Team Combat**: During combat, one DM could describe the environment and set the scene, while the other manages the mechanics and player actions. This could help keep the pace of combat quick and engaging.    4. **Player Agency**: We could allow players to choose which DM they want to interact with for certain scenarios, giving them a sense of agency and making the game feel more personalized.    5. **Session Themes**: Each DM could take turns running different sessions with unique themes or styles. For example, one DM could run a horror-themed session while the other focuses on a light-hearted adventure. This could keep the campaign fresh and exciting.    I’m curious if anyone here has experience with dual DMs and what worked or didn’t work for you. Any tips or suggestions on how to make this setup successful? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently had a fun idea for a project that combines machine learning with a game show format, specifically Family Feud. The concept is to create a machine learning model that predicts the most popular answers to survey questions, just like the game does.     Here's how I envision it:  1. **Data Collection**: First, I would gather a dataset of past Family Feud questions and the corresponding answers given by survey participants. This could involve scraping data from various online sources or using existing datasets if available.    2. **Data Preprocessing**: The next step would be to clean and preprocess the data. This would include handling missing values, normalizing text responses, and possibly encoding categorical variables to prepare them for modeling.    3. **Model Selection**: I would explore different machine learning algorithms to see which one performs best for this type of prediction task. Options could include decision trees, random forests, or even more advanced models like gradient boosting or neural networks.    4. **Training and Evaluation**: After selecting a model, I would split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall would be important to assess how well the model predicts the top answers.    5. **Deployment**: Finally, I could create a simple web application where users can input a Family Feud question and receive the model's predictions for the most popular answers. This could be a fun tool for fans of the show or even for trivia nights!    I think this project could be a great way to apply machine learning in a fun and engaging way. Plus, it would be interesting to see how well a model can mimic the responses of real survey participants.     Has anyone else tried something similar, or does anyone have suggestions on how to improve this idea? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

__label__0 Hello Dears    I am a backend programmer with Django from Iran    Unfortunately, people are in a difficult situation in our country due to the wrong policies of the government.    I've been looking for a job for a while, but since we were sanctioned by America, I can't use freelancing and job search sites like freelancer or Upwork. We can't even have a simple PayPal account, which is needed to register on most of these sites.    Programming salaries in Iran are very low compared to other countries, and even though I am really interested in this profession, I have been thinking about leaving and changing my job for some time...tbh I'm kinda lost at this point.

__label__1 I’m curious about the appropriateness of dressing as a character from a different race for Halloween. My sister, who is white, wants to dress up as Erica from Stranger Things, who is a Black character. I’ve seen discussions about cultural appropriation and how it can be offensive when someone dresses up as a character of a different race, especially if it involves stereotypes or caricatures.    On one hand, I understand that Halloween is a time for fun and creativity, and many people dress up as characters they admire, regardless of race. On the other hand, I also recognize that there are deeper issues at play regarding representation and respect for different cultures.    What do you all think? Is it okay for my sister to dress as Erica, or should she consider choosing a different character? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic!
__label__1 I recently had a pretty interesting experience while shopping at Target, and I wanted to share it with you all! So, I was browsing through the clothing section, looking for some new fall outfits, and I noticed that Target has really stepped up their style game this year.     First off, the variety of styles is impressive. They have everything from cozy sweaters to chic dresses, and I found myself drawn to a lot of pieces that I wouldn't typically expect to find at a big box store. I ended up trying on a few items, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. The fabrics felt soft and durable, and the fit was surprisingly flattering.     I also loved how they are incorporating more sustainable materials into their clothing lines. It feels good to know that I can shop for stylish clothes while also being mindful of the environment.     One of my favorite finds was a chunky knit cardigan that I can already tell will be a staple in my wardrobe this season. It’s perfect for layering and adds a nice touch to any outfit. Plus, it was super affordable!     Has anyone else noticed the changes in Target's clothing styles lately? What are your favorite pieces or collections? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been working on a mob farm that utilizes both a skeleton spawner and a cave spider spawner, and I'm curious about how their proximity affects spawn rates.     From what I understand, each spawner has its own spawn area, and they can spawn mobs independently. However, if they are too close together, could the spawn rates of one affect the other? For example, if I have a skeleton spawn nearby, will it reduce the number of cave spiders that spawn, or vice versa?     I want to optimize my farm for maximum efficiency, so any insights or experiences you all have would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I kept seeing this book pop up in my recommended lists on Amazon so I finally decided to give it a go. To say it surpassed my expectations is probably the single biggest understatement ever because this is one of my favorite epic fantasy books in recent years hands down. I loved all the parallels to French North Africa, the colonialism themes and the richly layered history of the world. Only one book into this series and already it feels like a more fully rounded and alive fantasy world than a lot of ongoing or completed recent fantasy series out there, I was really amazed by that. The battle scenes and political intrigue were superbly written too

__label__0 Since april this year about every 6 weeks i have an (pseudo-?) allergic reaction ca. 30-60mins after having a meal.     My symptoms: Extremely itchy rash, wheals primarily on arms and torso, hot flash, leathery skin, dry cough, subtle dizziness, edema around my wrists and ankles.    The symptoms got worse with every reaction. It started out with just an itchy rash and wheals. The last time though (yesterday), my lungs were also affected for the first time. I got severe dry cough which made it hard to breathe.  Also, i usually get the wheals only on my arms and torso. However, yesterday i  literally got them everywhere. Under my hair, on my legs, even under my feet. I was really close on making an emergency call.    &amp;#x200B;    The last couple of things i ate before having a reaction:    Yesteday: Uncle Ben's instant rice + breaded schnitzel    6 weeks ago: Heavily seasoned french fries with 2 sausages    10 weeks ago: Noodles and breaded schnitzel    20 weeks ago: 2 sticky buns with sugar icing    Does someone see a similarity among these dishes? Only thing i see is that all of these are highly processed foods. I guess its probably some preservative or sweetener im allergic to.     &amp;#x200B;    Had my first outbreak in mid 2015. Then i had it about once every couple of years. But as i said since about spring this year, i already got it about 5 times. Definitely going to make an appointment at the allergist and gonna evade processed food for now.
__label__0 https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/05/credit-reports-are-now-free-every-week   -     https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action     -     As the title states and on their site "During these times of COVID-19, accessing your credit is important. That's why Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are now offering free weekly online reports through April 2021."    I stumbled upon this today when I went to pull my report because my Credit saw a 70 point drop that I am still trying to figure out.     Stay informed everyone!
__label__0 The google ads representative is always calling and emailing me about recommendations to get my optimization scores up, but I always disregard them because my ads are performing well. How do you guys feel about this?
__label__1 This is a huge development in the ongoing saga surrounding the 2020 election and the claims of voter fraud. The court's finding that Trump knowingly lied about the numbers is significant, as it suggests a deliberate attempt to mislead the public and undermine the electoral process.     It's hard to overstate the implications of this ruling. If proven true, it could set a precedent for holding public figures accountable for spreading misinformation, especially when it comes to something as crucial as our democracy.     What do you all think? Will this change the way we view political discourse moving forward? And how do you think this will impact Trump's future political ambitions? Let's discuss!
__label__1 I’ve been working on the Seasons.py problem for CS50, and I have to admit, I’m feeling a bit lost. I understand the basic concept of determining the season based on the month and day, but the implementation is where I’m getting stuck.     I’ve read through the problem set description multiple times, but I’m still confused about how to structure my code. I know I need to use conditional statements to check the month and day, but I’m not sure how to handle the edge cases, especially around the transition dates for each season.     For example, how do I account for the fact that spring starts on March 20th or 21st depending on the year? And what about the leap year aspect? I thought I had a grasp on the leap year algorithm, but it seems to complicate things further when trying to determine the exact start of spring.     If anyone has tips on how to approach this problem or can share their thought process, I would really appreciate it! I’m eager to learn and get this right, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Ahem…    ****GONG***    That is all, bell boys unite!
__label__1 I recently picked up my prescription for Zoloft, and I noticed that there are 28 pills in the box, but there are also two pills that are separate from the rest. I’m a bit confused about this. Is this a common practice?     I’ve been on Zoloft for a while now, and I’ve never seen this before. Are those two separate pills meant to be a backup in case I lose one or miss a dose? Or is there some other reason for the extra pills?     I’d love to hear if anyone else has experienced this or knows why it’s done this way. Thanks!
__label__1 Title: Thoughts on the recent market fluctuations?    Hey everyone,    I've been keeping an eye on the market lately, and it seems like we've been experiencing some significant fluctuations in the prices of our gems and sneakers. I wanted to get your thoughts on what might be causing this volatility.     Is it just the typical ebb and flow of the market, or do you think there are specific factors at play? I've noticed some players are hoarding gems, while others are quick to sell off their assets.     Do you think this is a good time to buy, or should we hold off until things stabilize? Let's discuss strategies and share insights on how we can navigate these changes together!     Looking forward to hearing your opinions!

__label__1 Hey everyone! So, I have a bit of a situation. I recently adopted a tiny dog as a surprise for my partner, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed!     First off, I had no idea how much energy this little guy has! He’s a 3-month-old Chihuahua mix and he’s already running around like a little tornado. I want to make sure I’m doing everything right for him, but I’m not sure where to start.     What are some essential tips for caring for a tiny dog? I’ve read about their dietary needs and how to socialize them, but I could really use some advice on training and keeping him entertained.     Also, any recommendations for toys that are safe for small breeds? I want to make sure he has plenty of things to play with that won’t be a choking hazard.     Thanks in advance for your help! I’m excited but also a bit nervous about being a new dog parent!
__label__0 Today, I was ghosted and blocked by someone I was supposed to meet up with from bumble. We made the plan a week in advance and talked all week until the day came to meet up. We had a good time talking so I didn’t think anything was wrong. I noticed her texting habits became somewhat slower about two days before the meetup but I ignored it.     I texted her the day before asking if we were still up for Sunday and she asked what time, I told her noon. However, when I drove 30 minutes out to the town we would meet up at, I ended up waiting at a bench for 40 minutes.     I texted her saying that I was at the restaurant but was no reply. In fact, I saw that my text didn’t even get delivered. I called her and it went straight to voice mail. She even unmatched and blocked me that day too when I tried texting and voice calling her on bumble. Over an hour of my time was wasted because she didn’t have the fucking decency to tell me that she wasn’t interested anymore.     She then has the nerve to block me the day of the meet up because she’s too chickenshit to face the fact that she hurt someone. Instead, she acts like a toddler and decides to cover her ears and close her eyes to pretend like I don’t exist. Is this shit socially acceptable these days or something? Fuck me I guess, I suppose I’m not worth anything if it’s just so easy to pretend like I don’t exist.
__label__0 ... as on the HOTD sub. Whenever I venture there, I see people claiming that Viserys is a rapist. Before the show aired, they argued that he rapes Aemma and forces her to have children. Then they claimed that he rapes Alicent. Now I see them arguing that Alicent's reaction to Aegon's rape of Dyana points to her own experience of marital rape.    I do not remember seeing either Aemma or Alicent not consenting to having sex with Viserys, and I was never under impression that sex one does not enjoy counts as rape. If I am missing something here, please let me know.
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m looking to invest in some workout equipment for my home gym and I thought I’d ask for your recommendations on what to buy from Amazon. I’m trying to create a versatile setup that allows me to do a variety of workouts, including strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises.     Here’s what I’m considering so far:  1. **Adjustable Dumbbells** - I’ve seen a lot of options, but I want something that’s compact and easy to adjust.  2. **Resistance Bands** - I think these are great for adding variety to workouts and they don’t take up much space.  3. **Yoga Mat** - For stretching and floor exercises, I want something with good grip and cushioning.  4. **Kettlebell** - I’ve heard kettlebells are great for full-body workouts, but I’m not sure what weight to start with.  5. **Pull-Up Bar** - I’d love to incorporate pull-ups into my routine, but I need a bar that can fit in my doorway.    If you have any specific products you love or think I should avoid, please let me know! Also, if there are any other pieces of equipment you think are essential for a home gym, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’m a 22-year-old woman and I’ve been seriously considering getting my tubes tied. I know this is a big decision, and I want to make sure I’m making the right choice for myself. I’ve always known that I don’t want children, and I feel like this is the best way to ensure that I don’t end up in a situation where I might change my mind or feel pressured to have kids in the future.    However, I’ve heard that many doctors are hesitant to perform this procedure on younger women, especially if they don’t have children already. I’m worried that I might face pushback or be told that I’m too young to make this decision. I’ve done a lot of research and I’m confident in my choice, but I’m not sure how to approach this with a healthcare provider.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you go about discussing this with your doctor? Any advice on how to advocate for myself and my decision would be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel empowered in my choices about my own body.
__label__0 Hi I'm having trouble getting slides to display all information in edit mode.    My lecturer has provided slides but they have animations that I'm struggling to disable. I wish to be able to view the slides in their entirety in edit mode, meaning I don't have to view them in slideshow mode and click through all the animations. I've attached two images of the same slide to try and show what I mean.    I've tried removing the animations but it deletes the text associated with the animation.

__label__1 Hey there! I'm a 35-year-old guy looking to connect with someone who can appreciate a good sense of humor and maybe share some laughs. I work in a pretty quiet environment, which sometimes feels like an undertaker's after a big news story—definitely not the most exciting place!     I enjoy chatting about everything from movies and music to conspiracy theories and the weird things we all think about but never say out loud. If you're looking for someone to share your thoughts with, or just want to have a good laugh about the absurdities of life, I’d love to hear from you! Let's not be suspicious of each other—just two people looking for a friend.     Feel free to drop a message, and let’s see where this goes!
__label__1 I came across a deal for a brand new Sunfire SDS-12 subwoofer for $400, and I'm trying to decide if it's worth it. I've heard great things about Sunfire's build quality and performance, especially in terms of deep bass and overall sound clarity.     For those who own or have experience with the SDS-12, how does it perform in a home theater setup? Is it capable of handling both movies and music well? Also, how does it compare to other subwoofers in the same price range?     Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__0 For those who aren’t aware, way back in the dark times of Destiny 1, Warlocks had the privilege of their gauntlets also providing shoulder drip. This, as one can imagine, allowed much more freedom in customizing your Warlock’s silhouette. Sure, some gauntlets didn’t have any shoulder bits, but if they didn’t you can bet they had a great design that covered the full gloves.     Which brings me to my example. Look at the King’s Fall gauntlets. LOOK AT THEM! They are silly little spiral arm bands. If you showed that to 100 Destiny players last week I guarantee not a single one would know what theme it comes from, much less the specific set it’s a part of.     Every day, I mourn the loss of Warlock shoulder drip, I hope some of my brethren feel the same.
__label__0 I moved out of a flat about a week ago. The landlord failed to put my deposit into a protection scheme within 30 days of receiving it (he did eventually put it into a protection scheme but not until about two months after he was sent the deposits money).    I have learned (via other posts on this subreddit) that because my landlord broke tendency deposit rules, he is liable to be fined anything between 1 and 3 times the deposit amount as compensation to me.     Do I have to offer my landlord an amount of money I'd accept as a settlement? I've read a few thing online which suggest it's normal to do this. Would offering to settle for 1 times value of the deposit (so the minimum amount he can be fined) be reasonable?
__label__1 I've been having some interesting conversations with my friend about dating and attraction, and I can't help but wonder if he's actually onto something or just spouting off opinions. He claims that confidence is the most attractive trait a person can have, and that it can make up for a lot of other perceived shortcomings. He also insists that the way you carry yourself and your body language can either draw someone in or push them away, regardless of how you look.    He often talks about the importance of being genuine and authentic, saying that people can sense when someone is being fake or trying too hard. He believes that if you can be yourself and show genuine interest in others, it will naturally attract people to you.     Additionally, he mentions that humor is a huge factor in attraction. He says that being able to make someone laugh not only breaks the ice but also creates a connection that can lead to something more.     So, I’m curious—do you guys think he’s right? Is confidence really the key to attraction? How much do body language and authenticity play into it? And what about humor? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!
__label__0 My father has had dementia for a few years. Mostly it has affected his cognitive abilities versus memory.   The last few months his memory has been declining as well. Declining in areas that I think are odd and illogical.    For instance, I found him crying the other day because he found a picture of my mom from 20 years ago and he missed her.  She is alive and living with him (for 58 years) but he doesn't seem to grasp that she is the same person. No matter how hard I try to help him remember or describe his life with her he doesn't seem to get it. He can't remember her name and always asks how long she wl be visiting.      However,  he remembers me, my husband and kids.  He can get our names mixed up but knows who we are.   (I am primary caregiver for my folks although I don't live with them. They are completely dependent on me.).     Is it not odd that the most recent memories (myself and my kids) should go first?  He has known my mom for so long that I would think knowing who she is would be the last to go?    Thoughts or experiences?
__label__1 I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately, and I just need some comfort. It seems like everything is piling up at once—work is stressful, I’m struggling to keep up with my responsibilities, and I feel like I’m constantly letting people down. I know I should be able to handle it, but some days it just feels like too much.     I miss the days when I could just come to you and feel safe, where I could curl up on the couch and you’d wrap your arms around me and tell me everything would be okay. I could really use that right now. I just want to hear that I’m doing my best and that it’s okay to feel this way.     I know you’re busy, but if you could just take a moment to remind me that I’m not alone in this, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for always being there, even when things get tough.
__label__1 Hey everyone! It's that time again for our daily random discussion thread. Whether you want to chat about the latest happenings in Sydney, share your favorite local spots, or just vent about your day, this is the place to do it!    What’s on your mind today? Have you discovered any hidden gems in the city lately? Or maybe you have some tips for navigating the public transport system?     Also, with the weather being so unpredictable lately, how are you all coping? Any fun indoor activities or events happening that you’d recommend? Let’s get the conversation going!
__label__0 This latest announcement is like a 3 minute read. I count FOUR TIMES that they say essentially the same thing, which is nothing, in this announcement.    "More specific details around ticket packages will be announced in July, along with more information about events, panels, special guests, and exclusives you can only get at Magic 30."    "We'll announce even more guests as we get closer to the event."    "We'll share more details on these events as we get closer to 2023."    "...we have many more details to come in July."    There is very little actionable information in this "announcement" and my group chats are livid.    This continues to be among the most frustrating aspects of WotC's approach to everything.

__label__1 I've been thinking about the potential for hitcan mechanics in Brawl Stars and wanted to get the community's thoughts on it. For those who might not be familiar, hitcan refers to a shooting mechanic where the projectile hits the target instantly upon firing, as opposed to traveling over time like most of the current brawlers' attacks.    Imagine a brawler with a hitcan attack that could deal damage instantly, making it easier to hit moving targets. This could add a new layer of skill to the game, as players would need to be precise with their aim and timing.     However, I can also see some balance issues arising from this. Hitcan brawlers might dominate in modes like Showdown or Brawl Ball, where quick reactions can lead to easy eliminations or goals. On the other hand, it could also make for some exciting gameplay in modes like Gem Grab or Siege, where positioning and strategy are key.    What do you all think? Would hitcan mechanics be a good addition to Brawl Stars, or would they disrupt the current balance? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 So the other day, our head cook was in a particularly jovial mood, and he decided to play a little prank on the new line cooks. He told them that we had a secret ingredient that made our sauces extra special, and that it was a rare spice only found in the mountains of Peru. He went on to describe this mythical spice in great detail, claiming it was harvested by monks during a full moon and that it had magical properties.    The new cooks were wide-eyed and eager to learn, and he had them convinced that they needed to go on a quest to find this spice. He even drew a treasure map on a piece of butcher paper and told them it was hidden in the back of the walk-in freezer.     They spent a good half hour searching through the freezer, moving boxes and looking under bags of frozen peas, while the rest of the kitchen staff was in stitches watching them. Finally, the head cook revealed that the "secret ingredient" was just a pinch of salt and a lot of love.     The new cooks were a bit embarrassed but took it in stride, and now they have a running joke about their "expedition to Peru" every time they make sauce. It’s nice to see some humor in the kitchen, especially during the busy dinner rush!
__label__1 I've been playing Overwatch for a while now, but the new ranked system has me really confused. I used to have a pretty good grasp on how SR worked and how to climb the ranks, but with the recent changes, I feel lost.     Can someone explain how the new matchmaking works? I’ve heard about the role queue and how it affects your rank, but I’m not sure how it all ties together. Also, what’s the deal with the new competitive points system?     Any tips on how to improve my rank under this new system would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 This is such an interesting and bizarre scenario to think about! If the next American president were to make a statement like that, I think my initial reaction would be a mix of confusion and disbelief.     First off, the idea of forcing people to take college biology classes based on their looks seems not only impractical but also a bit absurd. It raises a lot of questions about the criteria for being considered "best looking" and how that relates to someone's beliefs about vaccines.     I would probably find myself laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all, but then I’d also be concerned about the implications of such a statement. It feels like it could lead to a slippery slope of government overreach into personal beliefs and education.     On a more serious note, I think it would spark a lot of debate about the importance of education in public health and how to effectively communicate scientific information to those who are skeptical. Maybe instead of forcing classes, there could be more outreach programs that engage with anti-vax communities in a respectful way to address their concerns and misinformation.     Overall, I think it would be a moment that highlights the divide in our society regarding science and personal beliefs, and it would definitely make for some interesting discussions on social media!
__label__0 Hey all,   I've been playing PVZ2 for years now. Massive fan when I was a kid even though I sucked at it. Once the arena update dropped I stopped playing (didn't like the gamemode, got bored, no new levels) and ever since it's been on and off.   However returning to the game and seeing the massive category of strange new plants they added (without any worlds accompanying them...😔) made me want to collect a few (namely Snap Pea, Mega Gatling Pea and Butter Lettuce).  The game only tells me that I can collect it during the long-gone limited time events. Is it impossible to unlock them now? Or do I have to painstakingly pray to RNGsus that I get enough random bonus seed packets to unlock it at level 1? If so, that doesn't sound very fun.
__label__1 The UFC game cover curse is a phenomenon that has plagued several fighters over the years, and I can't help but feel that Israel Adesanya might be the next victim. For those who aren't familiar, the curse seems to strike fighters who appear on the cover of the UFC video games, often leading to a string of losses or setbacks shortly after their big moment.    Adesanya, who has been a dominant force in the middleweight division, recently graced the cover of the latest UFC game. While he’s undoubtedly one of the most talented strikers in MMA history, the pressure of being on the cover could lead to unforeseen challenges. Just look at past cover athletes like Anthony Pettis and Conor McGregor, who faced tough times after their respective covers.    With the upcoming title fight against Dricus Du Plessis, I can’t shake the feeling that the curse might rear its ugly head. Adesanya has already faced some ups and downs in his career, and while he’s a master of mental warfare, the added pressure of being the face of the game could impact his performance.    What do you all think? Is the curse real, or just a coincidence? Will Adesanya be able to break the trend, or are we about to witness another chapter in the saga of the UFC game cover curse?
__label__1 Hey there! I'm a 28-year-old guy looking for a player 2 to join me in this game called life. I’m currently living in the US but I’m open to connecting with anyone, anywhere.     A little about me: I enjoy gaming (big fan of RPGs and co-op games), binge-watching shows, and exploring new places. I love trying out new restaurants and going on spontaneous adventures. I’m also a huge fan of board games and would love to find someone who enjoys them as much as I do.     I’m looking for someone who is fun, easy-going, and has a good sense of humor. Ideally, you should be someone who enjoys chatting and getting to know each other, whether it’s through gaming, video calls, or just texting.     If you’re interested in teaming up for some gaming sessions or just want to chat and see where things go, feel free to reach out! Let’s see if we can create our own little adventure together.
__label__1 I've been having a frustrating time trying to teleport to TheIsland890. Every time I search for it, it just doesn't show up in the session list, and it's really annoying because I know my friends are playing there.     I've tried refreshing the server list multiple times, and even restarting the game, but nothing seems to work. It feels like there are so many servers that just don’t appear when you search, and it makes it hard to join up with friends or find a good spot to play.     Is anyone else experiencing this issue? Is there a fix or workaround that I might be missing? I really want to get back into the game without having to jump through hoops just to find the right server.

__label__0 Anthony Davis in these playoffs:    27.6 pts / 10.9 reb / 4.1 ast / 1.5 blk    58.6 fg% / 39.1 3pfg%    Jokic can challenge AD without help in the post for the most part, but face up at the top of the key or the elbow, the Nuggets will need to bring the double.   AD has improved a lot with reading the floor and passing out of the double probably thanks to Lebron and coach Jason Kidd.   So as much as everyone is talking about who is guarding Jokic, the Nuggets better have a plan to contain AD as well.

__label__1 Hey everyone! I just changed the wheels on my skates for the first time and I’m super excited! I’ve been skating on the stock wheels that came with my skates, but I finally decided to upgrade to some softer wheels for better grip and a smoother ride.    I went with 78A durometer wheels since I’ve heard they’re great for outdoor skating. I also picked a fun color that matches my skates!     I was a bit nervous about the whole process, but it turned out to be pretty straightforward. I watched a couple of YouTube tutorials to make sure I was doing it right, and I think I did a decent job!     I can’t wait to take them out for a spin this weekend. Any tips for breaking in new wheels or things I should look out for? Also, how do you guys feel about the difference in ride quality with softer wheels?     Thanks in advance for any advice!

__label__1 I've been working on developing an original character for a fantasy story I'm writing, and I would love some feedback on the concept and details I've come up with so far.     **Character Name:** Elara Windrider    **Age:** 27    **Race:** Half-Elf    **Occupation:** Skyship Navigator      **Background:** Elara was born to a human mother and an elven father, who was a renowned navigator in the elven fleet. After her father's disappearance during a storm at sea, Elara grew up feeling the weight of expectation to follow in his footsteps. She spent her childhood learning the art of navigation and the secrets of the skies from her mother, who was a skilled cartographer.     **Personality:** Elara is adventurous and fiercely independent, often finding herself at odds with authority figures. She has a deep love for the open skies and a strong sense of justice, which drives her to help those in need, even if it puts her in danger. However, she struggles with feelings of inadequacy and the fear of not living up to her father's legacy.     **Appearance:** Elara has long, wavy auburn hair that she often ties back with a leather strap. Her eyes are a striking green, reminiscent of the forests of her elven heritage. She wears practical clothing suited for life aboard a skyship, often adorned with small trinkets collected from her travels.     **Skills:** Elara is an expert navigator, skilled in reading the stars and weather patterns. She also has a knack for repairing skyship machinery, a skill she learned from her father. Additionally, she possesses a limited ability to manipulate wind, a gift from her elven lineage, which she is still learning to control.     **Conflict:** Elara's journey begins when she discovers a plot to sabotage the skyship fleet, which could lead to a catastrophic disaster. Torn between her desire to prove herself and the fear of failure, she must rally a group of misfits to uncover the truth and save the fleet.     I’m particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on her backstory and personality. Does she feel relatable? Are there any aspects that seem cliché or overdone? Any suggestions for how to deepen her character or make her journey more compelling would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__1 I just wanted to share a little bit of my journey with OCD in hopes that it might help someone else who is struggling. I’ve been dealing with OCD for as long as I can remember, and for a long time, I felt completely overwhelmed by it. My compulsions and intrusive thoughts would take over my life, and I often felt like I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of anxiety and fear.    However, I want to emphasize that it can get better. I started therapy about a year ago, and it has made a world of difference. My therapist introduced me to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), which have been incredibly helpful in managing my symptoms. It was tough at first, facing my fears and learning to resist the compulsions, but with time and practice, I’ve noticed significant improvements.    I still have bad days, and there are moments when the OCD tries to creep back in, but I now have tools to cope with it. I’ve learned to challenge my thoughts and remind myself that just because I feel a certain way doesn’t mean it’s true. I’ve also started journaling my experiences, which helps me process my feelings and track my progress.    If you’re feeling hopeless or overwhelmed, please know that you’re not alone, and there is hope for a better future. It takes time and effort, but with the right support and strategies, it is possible to manage OCD and live a fulfilling life. Don’t hesitate to reach out for help, whether it’s from a therapist, support group, or even just sharing your experiences here. You deserve to feel better.
__label__1 I'm planning to travel from Manhattan to Newark Airport on a Friday morning and I'm looking for the best transit options.

__label__1 I've been diving deep into the mechanics of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and one question keeps popping up in my mind: can you stealth kill every boss in the game?     During my playthrough, I found that while many of the mercenaries and cultists can be taken down quietly, some of the main story bosses seem to have a different approach. For instance, I was able to stealth kill a few of the more minor bosses, but when it came to major characters like Deimos or the final boss, it felt like the game pushed me towards a more direct confrontation.     I’m curious to hear about your experiences! Have you managed to stealth kill any of the major bosses? If so, how did you pull it off? And for those who tried and failed, what strategies did you use? Let’s share our tactics and see if we can figure out the best way to approach these encounters!     Also, do you think the game should allow for stealth kills on all bosses, or does the current design enhance the overall experience? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

__label__1 I've been diving deeper into my home lab setup and I'm starting to get concerned about power usage. I have a mix of servers, networking equipment, and a few Raspberry Pis running various services. I want to make sure I'm not only optimizing performance but also keeping an eye on my electricity bill.    Currently, I have:  - 2 x Dell PowerEdge R710 servers  - 1 x HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen10  - 1 x Ubiquiti UniFi switch  - 3 x Raspberry Pi 4s  - A few external hard drives for backups    I’ve been using a Kill-A-Watt meter to track the power consumption of each device, but I’m curious about what others are seeing in their setups.     What are your strategies for managing power usage in your home lab? Do you have any tips for reducing consumption without sacrificing performance? Also, are there any specific tools or software you recommend for monitoring power usage more effectively?     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__0 i do not understand. sometimes i see these people on the internet completely flabbergasted at the fact that the muslim community does not think highly of them or respect them like they respect other muslims. i saw a tiktok asking gay muslims how they follow a religion that goes against their identity and someone commented that they just see it as a test from allah. right. allah is “testing” you by giving you the urge to do something that is “shameful”. as in ur supposed to be shameful of these urges. what these people don’t understand is that being gay isn’t supposed to be something that is celebrated, broadcasted or even an identity in islam. it’s supposed to a sin which you should be ashamed of and hide. i saw another person saying that “no other muslim will be as insulted or looked down upon than an openly queer person in the muslim community, even tho he does not sin”. right. because you aren’t supposed to be open about it. saw another “progressive muslim” saying that “a muslim who drinks and fucks gets respected but gay muslims are the most insulted”. a muslim who drinks does not go around calling themselves an alcohol drinking muslim and a muslim who has sex does not go around calling themselves a premarital sex having muslim WHAT IS NOT CLICKING?? it always pains me as a gay person seeing gay muslims desperately try to satisfy other muslims. “look guys i’m not acting upon it!!! please accept meeeeee🥺🥺”. they will not. they will not respect you until you get rid of the label all together. i can’t imagine the mind olympics these people have to go through to be this content with their religion. why subject urself to this kinda horrible treatment get out of there bro😭😭.
__label__1 If you're looking to disable the flashlight button on your iPhone 13, there are a couple of methods you can try, although it's important to note that there isn't a direct way to completely remove the flashlight feature from the Control Center. Here are some options:    1. **Remove from Control Center**: You can customize your Control Center settings to remove the flashlight icon, but this will also remove other shortcuts. Go to **Settings > Control Center** and then tap the red minus sign next to the flashlight to remove it from the Control Center. However, this will also remove other features you might want to keep.    2. **Use Guided Access**: If you want to restrict access to the flashlight while using a specific app, you can enable Guided Access. Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access** and turn it on. Set a passcode, then start Guided Access in the app you want to use. This will disable the flashlight button while you're in that app.    3. **Use Screen Time Restrictions**: You can also set up Screen Time restrictions to limit access to certain apps or features, but this is more of a workaround and may not directly disable the flashlight button.    4. **Physical Workaround**: If you find yourself accidentally turning on the flashlight, consider using a case that covers the side buttons or simply being more mindful of how you handle your phone.    Unfortunately, Apple does not currently provide a straightforward way to disable the flashlight button entirely, but these methods can help you manage its accessibility. If you have any other tips or tricks, feel free to share!

__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’ve been playing D&D with my group for a while now, and our DM has been feeling pretty burnt out lately. They’ve been running our campaign for over a year, and I can tell that the excitement has waned a bit for them. I really want to help rekindle their passion for the game and make it fun for them again.      Here are a few ideas I’ve been considering:    1. **One-Shot Adventures**: I thought about suggesting we take a break from the main campaign and run some one-shot adventures. This could give our DM a chance to explore different storylines without the pressure of a long-term commitment.    2. **Player-Driven Storylines**: I want to encourage my fellow players to create backstories or side quests that could be integrated into the main campaign. This way, our DM can focus on what we’re interested in and feel less pressure to come up with everything themselves.    3. **DM Appreciation**: I’m thinking of organizing a little appreciation session where we can all share what we love about the campaign and our DM’s style. Maybe even a small gift or a thank-you card to show our gratitude for their hard work.    4. **Collaborative World-Building**: I’ve heard of some groups that involve the players in world-building. Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas together, allowing our DM to take a step back and let us contribute to the world we’re playing in.    5. **Game Night Themes**: To spice things up, we could introduce themed game nights, like a costume night or a food night where we bring snacks that fit the campaign’s setting.      I’d love to hear your thoughts on these ideas or any other suggestions you might have! How have you helped your DMs when they were feeling burnt out? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 One of my all-time favorite books is "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern. I absolutely love the enchanting atmosphere, the intricate plot, and the beautifully crafted characters. However, if I could change one thing, it would be the pacing in the middle section of the book.     While the beginning and the end are captivating and filled with tension, I found that some parts in the middle dragged a bit, which made it hard to maintain the same level of excitement. I think tightening up those sections or adding more action could enhance the overall flow of the story.     Additionally, I would love to see more character development for some of the supporting characters. They are intriguing, but I felt like they could have had more depth and backstory to make their motivations clearer and their arcs more satisfying.     What about you? What would you change about your favorite book?
__label__0 I was watching animation memes to pass the time when on particular one showed up and I watched it.  I’ve never had any issues watching an epileptic warning video before, but this one made me almost throw up.  Nothing was disturbing or anything like that, I think it was the flask of the video?  I freaked out and didn’t know if I would have a seizure because of the need to throw up, and I panicked and layer on the floor just in case.  I’ve never had a seizure before and have never been diagnosed with anything, I just want to know if anyone has any thoughts on this please.  Thank you for reading.

__label__1 I recently passed a kidney stone about a week ago, and while the intense pain from the stone has subsided, I’m still experiencing persistent discomfort in my kidney area. It’s not as severe as the pain I felt during the stone passage, but it’s definitely noticeable and concerning.     I’ve been drinking plenty of water and following my doctor’s advice, but I’m wondering if it’s normal to have lingering pain after passing a stone. Could this be a sign of another stone forming, or is it possible that there’s some residual irritation or inflammation in the kidney?     Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms after passing a kidney stone? What did your doctor say, and how long did it take for the pain to completely go away? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I want to make sure I'm making a wise investment, especially since BMWs can be pricey to maintain. Any insights on what is covered, any exclusions to watch out for, and whether you think it’s worth the cost would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hi everyone! I'm looking to perfect my oatmeal cookie recipe and would love some advice from the community. I want to achieve that perfect balance of chewy and crispy, with a nice flavor that really highlights the oats.     Here’s the basic recipe I’ve been using:    **Ingredients:**    - 1 cup unsalted butter, softened    - 1 cup brown sugar    - 1/2 cup granulated sugar    - 2 large eggs    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract    - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour    - 1 teaspoon baking soda    - 1/2 teaspoon salt    - 3 cups rolled oats    - Optional: 1 cup raisins or chocolate chips      **Instructions:**    1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).    2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth.    3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.    4. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; gradually blend into the creamed mixture.    5. Stir in the oats and any optional ingredients like raisins or chocolate chips.    6. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets.    7. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.    8. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.    Now, here are my questions:  1. **Texture:** How can I make my cookies chewier? Should I add more brown sugar or perhaps a bit of honey or molasses?  2. **Flavor:** What spices or additional ingredients do you recommend to enhance the flavor? I’ve thought about adding cinnamon or nutmeg, but I’m not sure how much.  3. **Baking Time:** I’ve noticed that my cookies sometimes come out too soft or too hard. What’s the best way to know when they’re done baking?    I’m excited to hear your tips and tricks! Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I (24F) recently graduated from college and have been looking for a job in my field. While I’ve been applying to various positions, I’ve also been working part-time at a retail job to make ends meet. My parents (both in their late 50s) have always been supportive, but they also have a tendency to be a bit controlling about finances.    A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with them about my financial situation. I mentioned that I was struggling to pay my bills and that my part-time job wasn’t enough to cover everything. They offered me some advice on budgeting, which I appreciated, but I felt like they didn’t fully understand how tough things were for me.    In a moment of frustration, I demanded that they help me out financially. I asked for a specific amount to help cover my rent for the next couple of months until I could find a better job. I know this was a lot to ask, and I could tell it caught them off guard. They were upset and said that I should be more responsible and find a way to manage on my own.    I feel guilty for putting them in that position, but at the same time, I feel like they should be willing to help their daughter when she’s struggling. They’ve always said that family helps each other out, but now it feels like they’re not living up to that.     I’ve been thinking about it a lot and I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped by demanding money from them. AITA for asking my parents for financial help?
__label__1 I recently came across a new initiative in the UAE aimed at promoting sustainable living and reducing waste, and I wanted to share some details and gather more insights from the community.     The initiative, called "UAE Goes Green," focuses on encouraging residents to adopt eco-friendly practices in their daily lives. This includes everything from reducing plastic usage to promoting recycling and sustainable transportation options.     One of the key components of the program is the introduction of community workshops and events that teach residents how to compost, create zero-waste kitchens, and even grow their own vegetables. Additionally, there are incentives for businesses that implement sustainable practices, such as discounts on permits and recognition in local media.     I’m particularly interested in hearing from anyone who has participated in these workshops or has experience with sustainable living in the UAE. What tips do you have for someone looking to get started? Are there any local groups or resources you would recommend?     Also, if anyone has insights on how effective these initiatives have been so far, I would love to hear your thoughts. Let’s discuss how we can all contribute to a greener UAE!

__label__0 Most pit nutters I know or have seen are Trump supporters. Today at a store this guy...didn't even try and hide the fact his dog wasn't a service dog with the fake service dog vests you can buy online...he was wearing a pro gun shirt. I know it was a sh\*t bull because of the white spot under its neck. The sh\*t bull was barking and growing at this service dog an older guy had and the old guy had to pick up his service dog and throw it in his basket to protect it. You never see people on the left with these types of dogs. It always seems like pit bulls + republican/Trump supporting owners. Why? Have you not seen the news lately with attacks such as Jacqueline Durand in Texas or Kyle Waltman in South Carolina? Or the countless other maulings by these beasts? I honestly feel if right wing pit bull support went away these deamon dogs from hell would be finally banned and so many lives would be saved.
__label__1 In a world that often demands so much from us, prioritizing our mental health can feel like a daunting task. However, it is essential for our overall well-being and spiritual growth. Here are some strategies that have helped me, and I hope they can assist you too:    1. **Set Boundaries**: Learn to say no. It’s okay to prioritize your needs over others’ expectations. Setting boundaries with work, relationships, and social obligations can create the space you need to recharge.    2. **Practice Mindfulness**: Engaging in mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help ground you in the present moment. These practices allow you to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, fostering a sense of peace.    3. **Connect with Nature**: Spending time outdoors can be incredibly healing. Whether it’s a walk in the park, hiking in the mountains, or simply sitting in your garden, nature has a way of restoring our spirits and providing clarity.    4. **Seek Support**: Don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Whether it’s talking to a friend, joining a support group, or seeking professional therapy, sharing your feelings can lighten the load and provide new perspectives.    5. **Engage in Creative Outlets**: Find activities that allow you to express yourself, whether it’s painting, writing, dancing, or playing music. Creativity can be a powerful tool for processing emotions and finding joy.    6. **Limit Social Media**: While social media can connect us, it can also be a source of stress and comparison. Consider taking breaks or curating your feed to include only positive and uplifting content.    7. **Establish a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and stability. Incorporate activities that nourish your mind and body, such as exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep.    8. **Practice Gratitude**: Take time each day to reflect on what you are grateful for. This simple practice can shift your focus from what’s lacking in your life to the abundance that already exists.    9. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember that it’s okay to not be okay. Allow yourself to feel your emotions without guilt or shame. Self-compassion is a vital part of healing.    10. **Engage in Spiritual Practices**: Whether it’s prayer, meditation, or connecting with a community of like-minded individuals, nurturing your spiritual side can provide comfort and a sense of belonging.    Prioritizing mental health is not a one-time effort but a continuous journey. It’s about finding what works for you and being gentle with yourself along the way. Remember, you are not alone in this journey, and it’s perfectly okay to seek help and support. What are some practices you’ve found helpful in prioritizing your mental health?
__label__1 I recently decided to give my gaming setup a much-needed upgrade, and I’m super excited about it! I installed a new SSD to improve load times for The Sims 4, and I also set up a boot camp on my Mac to run Windows for better performance.     I’ve noticed a significant difference in how quickly the game loads, and the overall gameplay feels smoother. I can finally enjoy building without the annoying lag!     For anyone considering a similar upgrade, I highly recommend it. Just make sure to back up your files before diving into the installation process.     Also, if anyone has tips on optimizing The Sims 4 settings for the best performance on an SSD, I’d love to hear them! Happy simming!
__label__1 Hey everyone!    I’m a 29-year-old guy looking to spice things up a bit in my relationship. My partner and I are interested in finding a unicorn to join us for some fun and adventure. We’re both open-minded, respectful, and excited to explore new experiences together.      A little about us: we’re a loving couple who enjoy traveling, trying new foods, and having deep conversations. We’re looking for someone who is confident, fun, and comfortable in their own skin. Ideally, you should be someone who enjoys both intimate moments and just hanging out, whether it’s watching movies or going out for drinks.      If you’re interested in chatting and seeing if we vibe, feel free to reach out! We’d love to get to know you better and see where things go.      Looking forward to hearing from you!
__label__1 I’m looking for some advice on automating my garage door. Currently, I have a standard garage door opener that is not smart-enabled, and I’d like to add some home automation features to it.     I’ve seen a few options online, like the Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Hub, which seems to be a popular choice. However, I’m also considering a DIY approach using a smart relay or a Raspberry Pi to control the opener.     My main goals are:  1. Remote access to open/close the garage door via an app.  2. Integration with my existing smart home system (I use Home Assistant).  3. Possibly adding sensors to get notifications when the door is open or closed.    For those who have automated their garage doors, what solutions have you found to be the most reliable? Are there any specific products or DIY setups you would recommend? Also, if I go the DIY route, what components should I be looking for to ensure safety and reliability?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 Today has been one of those days where the urge to drink feels overwhelming. I woke up feeling anxious and stressed, and as the day has gone on, those feelings have only intensified. I find myself thinking about how easy it would be to just pour a drink and escape for a little while.     But I know that drinking won't solve my problems; it will only make them worse. I remember the nights I spent regretting my choices, the mornings filled with guilt and shame. I don't want to go back to that place.     Instead, I'm trying to focus on what I can do to cope with these feelings in a healthier way. I went for a walk earlier, which helped clear my mind a bit. I also reached out to a friend who understands what I'm going through. Just talking about it has made me feel less alone.     I’m reminding myself that these cravings will pass, and I don’t have to act on them. I’m committed to my sobriety and to finding better ways to handle my emotions. If anyone else is struggling today, know that you’re not alone. Let’s get through this together.
__label__1 I’m seeking advice regarding a harassment situation I’m currently facing in New York.     For some context, I (30F) have been receiving unwanted messages and phone calls from an ex-coworker (35M) since we both left our previous job about six months ago. Initially, I thought it was just him trying to maintain a friendship, but the messages quickly escalated to inappropriate comments and persistent attempts to meet up, despite me clearly stating that I’m not interested in any form of communication.     I’ve tried to block him on social media and my phone, but he seems to find ways to reach out through different platforms. Recently, he showed up at a local event I was attending, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. I didn’t engage with him, but I noticed he was watching me from a distance.     I’m unsure about what steps I should take next. I’ve documented all the messages and calls, including dates and times, and I’m considering filing a police report. However, I’m worried about the potential repercussions of that action and whether it will actually help my situation.     What are my options in New York regarding harassment? Should I file a police report, or is there another course of action I should consider? Additionally, what kind of evidence do I need to present if I decide to take legal action? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
__label__0 It's been 17 months since I got prescribed Metoprolol Succ ER at 25mg a day and + 12.5mg on bad days.     I'm 18 months in, feel like I'm 70-80% recovered with heart palpitations and blood pressure isn't as bad as it was before (except today, I'm in relapse and got a 136/82 reading)     I got a doctors appointment in a months and will ask to stop using it or at least attempt to.

__label__0 Kind of an odd question, but does anyone know of any cryptids, urban legends, well-known true crime cases, or just interesting/creepy stories from Bloomington?

I'm so interested in the creepy/strange sides of lore/culture in different towns. Thank you all for sharing with me! It's all been very interesting.

Luckily, he's picked up bu a very wealthy Alpha. Mike. Unlike most Alpha's,  Mike is kind and lets Will live with him, giving him access to food, showers and all the blankets he could desire.

__label__0 Hi,     did anybody register a vehicle in the last few month and can tell me how long it took to receive the title, and maybe which RMV they used, if there is a difference for the processing time.    I picked the one in Springfield and I am afraid that this might have been a bad choice for a speedy procedure.    Also had anyone ever luck to try to speed up with the RMV?    I just bought and registered a car in Massachusetts and only realized afterwards that the website of the RMV currently states that titles take 6-8 weeks currently.    I found conflicting information online, some claiming only 7-10 days while others say 3 weeks or some agree with the 6-8 weeks statement.     I have some relatively tight time window that i would really like to receive that title (leaving the country and selling the vehicle again, buyin and selling was just a lot cheaper than renting for someone &lt;25),    and I was wondering if I could increase my sample size on reddit.        Thanks!
__label__1 The question of whether an indoctrinated populace can be held responsible for the actions of their dictators is a complex and nuanced issue that touches on themes of free will, moral responsibility, and the nature of indoctrination itself.    On one hand, it can be argued that individuals who have been subjected to extensive indoctrination may lack the capacity to critically evaluate the actions and policies of their leaders. If a populace has been raised in an environment where dissent is not tolerated, where propaganda is pervasive, and where alternative viewpoints are systematically suppressed, their ability to make informed choices can be severely compromised. In such cases, it may seem unjust to hold them accountable for the actions of a dictator, as their beliefs and behaviors are heavily influenced by external forces beyond their control.    However, one could also argue that moral responsibility is not solely contingent upon the level of awareness or education one possesses. Even in situations of indoctrination, individuals still have the capacity to question and resist the narratives presented to them, albeit at great personal risk. History is replete with examples of individuals and groups who have stood up against oppressive regimes, suggesting that the potential for moral agency exists even in the most repressive environments. This raises the question of whether a complete lack of responsibility can be ascribed to an entire populace, especially when some members may actively oppose the regime.    Furthermore, the concept of collective responsibility complicates the issue. While individuals may be indoctrinated, the actions of a dictator often reflect the values and beliefs of a significant portion of the populace. In this sense, one could argue that a society that allows such a regime to flourish shares some degree of responsibility for its actions, as they may have failed to challenge or resist the status quo.    Ultimately, the question may not have a definitive answer, as it involves weighing the extent of indoctrination against the capacity for individual moral agency. It invites us to consider the broader implications of power, education, and resistance in shaping the moral landscape of a society. How do we balance the understanding of psychological manipulation with the expectation of ethical behavior? This is a rich area for philosophical exploration.

__label__1 I recently made a post about my experiences with BONELAB and some tips I found helpful, but it got removed. I’m not sure why it happened. I followed the subreddit rules, and I thought my content was relevant and engaging. Did I miss something? I’ve seen other posts that seem similar to mine still up, so I’m a bit confused. If anyone has insights on what might have gone wrong or how to avoid this in the future, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks!
__label__0 What could have caused this and do it affect the brewing??    Coffee still tasted rich bold and great which is what counts but if it could be better i want to learn.    I put fresh ground coffee in and leveled with my wdt for espresso to even out the grounds. I dont ever remember having this happen though.
__label__0 I (F44) am a single mom, raising two teenagers (M13 &amp; F15) on my own.   One thing I'm very glad about is my house is the fun house where my kids' friends prefer to get together and visit and hang out. Subsequently I'm always the mom taking them to the movies, shops, driving them around etc. And I don't mind, I really don't. (We live in South Africa, so I chaperone to make sure everyone's kids are safe)   I never ask for petrol money, parking money or even catering money when the kids come visit and have sleep overs.  I do however ask that each kid pay for their own movie and popcorn when I take them to the movies.  Never a problem, all the kids usually pay me their share as soon as they get in the car (I pre-book everything online and pay with my credit card, so then they all pay me back)  Except the one kid, let's call her Stacy (F16) ... Lovely child, she's really a joy to have around. I feel for her, her mom is also a single mom and quite absent (works a lot, travels often, but also does this weird thing where she just disappears and Stacy's aunt has to jump in and get her to school, etc.)  Now Stacy's mom always short pays... Just a R10 here or R5 there, and I just let it go.  I have only met her once, and she seems very sweet too.  This past weekend I took the kids to the movies and this time, Stacy's mom forgot to give her money. I don't want to make it awkward for Stacy so I say, no biggie you can pay me back next week.   AITA for not letting it go? I feel bad for the kid, but I also can't keep funding her.  Or did I shoot myself in the foot here by not asking for the little bits that was short paid from the beginning.  Just to put it into perspective R90 equals the cost of a popcorn and coke at the movies. Although it exchanges to 5 USD    Edited to add: Stacy's mom is loaded... As in drives a sports car, wears Gucci kinda loaded...
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm almost 18 weeks along and I still feel like I'm not really showing. I know every pregnancy is different, but I can't help but feel a bit anxious about it. I see so many other moms-to-be at this stage with noticeable bumps, and I just look like I had a big meal!     Is anyone else in the same boat? When did you start to show? I’m trying to remind myself that it’s normal and that my body is doing what it needs to do, but it’s hard not to compare. Any reassurance or stories would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 Gospel: Matthew 15:21-28    Friends, a long tradition stresses the perseverance of the Canaanite woman we meet in today’s Gospel. Augustine says that we pray in order to expand our will to accept what God is going to give us. Another reading shows how the woman exemplifies the proper attitude toward God, a combination of humility and boldness, of deference and defiance. We are creatures and God is God; nevertheless, God invites us into intimacy with him.    But I want to emphasize the reading conditioned by the "other." The Old Testament speaks insistently of the "stranger, the widow, and the orphan." The ethical life, in a biblical framework, is about the press of these people upon us. They press upon us even when we would greatly prefer them just to go away.    We the Church are the Body of Christ. And so people come to us demanding food, sustenance, friendship, love, shelter, or liberation. Often we are tempted to do what Jesus does initially and what the disciples do: tell them to back off. We are overloaded, busy, and preoccupied. We can’t be bothered.    But the whole of the Christian life consists in remembering the suffering and need of the annoying other.
__label__1 I’m a 19-year-old trans guy, and I’ve been on testosterone for about six months now. I’ve been feeling a lot of excitement about my transition, but I also find myself feeling scared and anxious about it at the same time. I’m not sure if this is normal or if I should be worried about my feelings.    I think part of my fear comes from the changes happening in my body. I’m excited to see the physical changes, but I also worry about how people will perceive me as I start to look more masculine. I’ve had some negative experiences in the past with being misgendered or facing hostility, and I’m scared that those experiences might come back as I transition more visibly.    Additionally, I’m nervous about how my relationships with friends and family will change. Some of my friends have been supportive, but I’m worried about how others will react, especially those who might not understand or accept my transition. I’ve heard stories of people losing friends or family members during their transition, and that scares me.    I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance or advice from others who have been through this. Is it normal to feel scared during this process? How did you cope with those feelings? Any tips on navigating the emotional side of transitioning would be really appreciated.

__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but I genuinely think RGIP (Real Housewives Grape Infused Prosecco) is actually delicious! I was skeptical at first, thinking it was just another gimmicky drink that the housewives would endorse, but I decided to give it a try after seeing some of the ladies rave about it on social media.     To my surprise, it has this perfect balance of sweetness and fizz that makes it super refreshing. I can totally see why they love it for their brunches and parties. Plus, it’s a fun conversation starter when you’re hosting friends!     I’ve tried it with some fruit garnishes, and it elevates the whole experience. I know some people might think it’s too sweet or not sophisticated enough, but honestly, it’s just a fun drink that fits the vibe of a housewives’ gathering.     Am I alone in this? Have any of you tried RGIP and loved it? Or do you think it’s just a fad? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 Hey so I love Marvel and have almost seen everything besides Winter Soldier. But I wanted to do a rewatch of everything but one problem.

I haven’t seen them in a long time and I was wondering if anyone could give a quick summary of them just like the important things so I don’t have to make myself suffer.

It's like I found the cheat code to Reddit!     Honestly, who knew that just existing as a trans person could be such a goldmine for karma?

__label__1 I’ve been feeling really lonely lately, and I think it’s because I’ve been trying to navigate my relationship with my loved one who struggles with alcoholism. It’s such a rollercoaster of emotions, and I often find myself feeling isolated even when I’m surrounded by family and friends.     I know that I’m not alone in this, but sometimes it feels like I am. I’ve been attending Al-Anon meetings, which have been incredibly helpful, but I still struggle with the feeling of companionship. I want to connect with others who understand what I’m going through, but it’s hard to reach out when I’m feeling down.     I find myself longing for someone to talk to who truly gets it—the late-night phone calls, the endless worry, the hope that things will get better, and the frustration when they don’t. I’ve tried to lean on friends, but they don’t always understand the complexities of loving someone with an addiction.     I guess I’m just looking for some encouragement or advice on how to foster connections with others who are in similar situations. How do you all cope with feelings of loneliness while supporting a loved one? What strategies have you found helpful in building a support network?     Thanks for listening. I appreciate this community more than I can express.
__label__1 I need some support right now. I feel like I'm in a deep pit of ugliness and despair. I just looked in the mirror and all I see is a mess. My skin is breaking out, my hair is a disaster, and I can't shake this feeling that I just don't look good enough.     I know we all have our off days, but today feels particularly rough. I keep thinking about all the times I've been judged or made to feel less than because of my appearance. It’s like a constant reminder that I don’t fit into the mold of what society deems beautiful.     I just want to feel okay in my own skin, but it’s hard when I feel like I’m constantly battling against my own reflection. If anyone else is feeling this way, please know you’re not alone. Let’s support each other through this ugly phase.     Sending love to anyone who needs it right now.
__label__1 I'm in a bit of a bind and could really use some advice. I've been trying to get in touch with my legal counsel for the past few weeks regarding an ongoing case, but I haven't been able to reach them. I've left multiple voicemails and sent emails, but I haven't received any response.     Background: I hired this attorney to help me with a personal injury case after an accident I was involved in. We had a few meetings initially, and I felt confident in their ability to represent me. However, as the case has progressed, I've had several questions and concerns that I need to discuss, especially since there are deadlines approaching for filing certain documents.     Current issue: I'm worried that if I can't get in touch with my attorney soon, I might miss important deadlines or not have the necessary information to make informed decisions about my case. I’m also concerned about whether this is a normal situation or if I should be worried about my attorney's availability.     Questions:   1. What should I do if I can't reach my attorney? Is there a formal process for addressing this?   2. Should I consider finding a new attorney, or is it better to wait it out?   3. Are there any steps I can take to protect my interests in the meantime?     Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Stereotypes can be found in every culture, and they often manifest in various ways, including physical features, behaviors, and even fashion choices. In many cultures, certain traits can lead to generalizations that may not reflect reality.     For example, in some Asian cultures, there can be stereotypes associated with skin tone. Lighter skin is often idealized, leading to the stereotype that those with darker skin are less attractive or less successful. This can be seen in beauty standards and advertising, where products for skin lightening are marketed heavily.    In Black culture, there are also stereotypes related to hair texture. For instance, there can be a perception that straight hair is more desirable than natural curls or afros, which can lead to the stereotype that those with natural hair are less professional or less put-together. This has been a significant topic of discussion, especially in the context of the natural hair movement, which seeks to challenge these stereotypes.    Indigenous cultures may also face stereotypes based on traditional attire or physical features. For example, there can be a stereotype that all Indigenous people wear traditional clothing or live in a certain way, which overlooks the diversity and modernity within these communities.    Overall, while hair color may not be as prominent a stereotype in these cultures as it is with blondes in white culture, there are certainly other physical traits and cultural markers that can lead to similar generalizations and misconceptions. It’s important to recognize these stereotypes and challenge them, as they can perpetuate harmful biases and misunderstandings.

__label__1 Growing up with a narcissistic parent, I often felt like I had to be hyper-aware of my surroundings and the emotions of those around me. It was like living in a constant state of alertness, trying to predict their moods and avoid triggering any outbursts. As a result, I developed a pretty strong sense of deduction and intuition about people and situations.    For example, I can often tell when someone is upset or hiding something, even if they’re trying to act normal. I’ve become adept at reading body language and picking up on subtle cues that others might miss. It’s almost like a sixth sense at this point. I can also analyze situations quickly and come up with solutions or responses that might not be immediately obvious to others.    However, I sometimes wonder if this skill is a double-edged sword. While it helps me navigate social situations and relationships, it also makes me overly cautious and anxious. I find myself second-guessing my instincts or feeling guilty for not being able to help others when they’re struggling, even if it’s not my responsibility.    Does anyone else feel like their upbringing has sharpened their powers of deduction? How do you cope with the anxiety that comes with it?

__label__1 Hello everyone! I'm a 32-year-old female looking to expand my circle of friends and connect with interesting people from around the world. I currently live in the USA and work in the tech industry, but I have a wide range of interests that I would love to share and discuss with others.

I also have a passion for travel and love learning about different cultures, so I would be thrilled to hear about your experiences and adventures!    I'm open to communicating through email, snail mail, or even social media if that’s more your style. I believe that everyone has a unique story to tell, and I’m excited to hear yours! Whether you want to chat about books, share travel tips, or just talk about life in general, I’m here for it.    Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in becoming pen pals!

__label__1 I've been playing Valorant on my PC for a while now, and I wanted to share some of my experiences and tips for anyone who might be new to the game or looking to improve their skills.     First off, the graphics and performance on PC are fantastic. I love how smooth the gameplay is, especially when I have my settings optimized. I recommend adjusting your graphics settings to find a balance between performance and visual quality. Lowering some settings can significantly increase your FPS, which is crucial in a competitive shooter like Valorant.    One thing I've noticed is the importance of communication with your team. Using voice chat or the ping system effectively can really turn the tide of a match. Make sure to call out enemy positions and coordinate strategies with your teammates.     Also, practicing your aim is key. I spend some time in the shooting range and use aim trainers to improve my flicks and tracking. It’s amazing how much a little practice can help you land those crucial headshots.    Lastly, don’t forget to experiment with different agents. Each one has unique abilities that can change the dynamics of a game. Finding an agent that suits your playstyle can make the game much more enjoyable.    What are your favorite tips for playing Valorant on PC? Any agents you recommend or strategies that have worked well for you? Let’s share some knowledge!
__label__0 My job requires me to move around between different locations multiple times a day. I rely very heavily on Google Calendar on my phone to tell me where I need to go next and at what time I need to get there. I would love to be able to glance down at a watch and know exactly what my next move is. So my questions are:    1. Can I sync my Google Calendar from Redmi phone onto a Galaxy Watch? Will they play nicely together? I've read through a few threads about this topic in this subreddit, but they are all full of deleted comments.   2. Would someone be able to share with me a photo of what the calendar looks like on their watch? Like via imgur or something like that. I really want to know what I'll be staring at 40 times a day.     Thank you all in advance!

__label__1 I’ve been grinding for weeks, hoping to pull Tighnari, but alas, the gacha gods have not smiled upon me this time. I’ve seen so many amazing builds and gameplay clips from you all, and it’s been inspiring to see how much love the community has for him.     I just wanted to take a moment to say goodbye to my dreams of adding him to my team. I’ll keep farming for primogems and maybe one day I’ll get lucky. Until then, I’ll be cheering you all on from the sidelines!     Good luck to everyone still pulling for him, and may your wishes be blessed! 🌿✨

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 25-year-old female and I'm here to share a bit about myself and see what kind of first impressions I make. I love exploring new places, trying out different cuisines, and I'm a huge fan of hiking and nature. I also enjoy reading, especially fantasy novels, and I dabble in painting during my free time.     I’m currently working in marketing, and I find it really fulfilling to help brands connect with their audiences. I’m also a bit of a nerd when it comes to movies and TV shows, so if you have any recommendations, I’m all ears!     I’m excited to hear your thoughts and any first impressions you might have! 😊
__label__0 I am having an issue with my oculus quest link. It was working fine and then randomly stopped. I checked the Plug Connection, and it was perfectly fine. Whenever i enable oculus to link a message pop up saying, "Hardware Notification" "Oculus Is Not Working"    In the actual headset, it's just the black screen with 3 dots. It does say that a 3.0 USB is recommended, but I don't think that would stop the entire thing from working, since the connection still works. Does anyone know anything about this or have tips to solve it?    I have a ASUS Windows 10 Laptop, NVIDA Ge-Force GTX 1060. Processor I7-7700HQ CPU, with 12GBs of Ram

__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently started a new realm with some friends, and we’re looking to spice things up with some add-ons. I’ve heard that using add-ons can really enhance the gameplay experience, but I’m not sure where to start.     What are some of your favorite add-ons for Minecraft realms? I’m particularly interested in ones that add new mobs, biomes, or gameplay mechanics. Also, if you have any tips on how to install them or any potential issues to watch out for, I’d really appreciate it!     Thanks in advance for your help!     Here’s a screenshot of our current realm setup:    ![Realm Setup](https://preview.redd.it/your-image-link.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=your-image-hash)
__label__0 I'm a 45 year old self-employed single mom with ADHD, and of course my house gets messy. I hated and berated myself for poor housekeeping for most of my life, but over the past few years have been working to accept myself and I'm not really ashamed of how I live anymore. So I don't live in a show home, who gives a shit? Not me.     Last weekend, my landlord announced that he would be by for an inspection in seven days. I finally took my parents up on their offer to "help" tidy up the house as I am very busy at work this week and I wanted the house to be tidy for the visit. I usually reject their offers of assistance as I know that it is just vicious and unrelenting judgement cloaked in the garb of helpfulness. *They* are ashamed of *my* home and I think deep down they believe that if I could just stop being so messy and unkempt I would be able to find a husband, which they view as the pinnacle of a woman's achievement in life. They do not seem to care that I am not interested in having a husband, but that's a topic for another day.    In the past five days they have:    * moved my e-commerce business inventory from the top floor to the bottom floor  * painted the spare bedroom and moved my office furniture into it  * reorganized the furniture in my bedroom  * cleaned all the bathrooms  * purchased and hung new curtains  * painted the upstairs hallway  * cleaned out the garage    Currently my father is cleaning out the laundry room and my mother is washing and sorting all my laundry. I was coping OK — working with all these people in the house is unmitigated hell, but I was keeping it together — but then I went downstairs to say hello in between meetings and my mother threw her hands up at the laundry and just said: "My God, \[my name\]," shaking her head. And now I am broken and deep into a shame spiral.     Let me just say that very little of this "help" was necessary for the landlord visit. The cleaning and organizing they are doing is largely for them, not for me —  they have ideas about how things "should" be organized and how things "should" be cleaned and I finally threw my hands up and was like, "OK, have at 'er, and if God loves me maybe you'll shut up and leave me alone about the house for awhile." I made the decision knowing that I was going to have to deal with some shaming from them. But I really needed the help.     I regret asking for help. I'm so angry and hurt. Their "help" has created a lot more work for me, because there's always sorting and organizing to be done once they've left — you can't really organize other peoples' stuff, right? The worst part, though, is that they are both obviously exhausted and acting like martyrs for coming over and doing all this work, which I did not ask them to do, but which I am expected to be grateful for, and I am also expected to be contrite and ashamed of the condition in which I keep my home, and to listen to my mother give me tips about laundry, i.e., just take it out of the dryer as soon as it's finished drying and fold it *right then* and put it away, and voila, no wrinkles and you're done! And I'm looking at her like she's an alien and being like ... DO YOU EVEN KNOW ME?        They deny my ADHD and view my disorganization as a moral failing and I hate them for it.         Like, FML. I am so done.

__label__1 I wanted to share my experience after the passing of my husband, who was never a Jehovah's Witness. As a lifelong JW, I was raised to believe that the only way to salvation was through the organization, and I had always been taught to view those outside of it with a certain level of skepticism.     When my husband passed away unexpectedly, I was devastated. He was my partner, my best friend, and the love of my life. I reached out to my congregation for support, hoping to find comfort in the community I had always relied on. However, the response I received from some of the members was disheartening.     Instead of offering condolences and support, I was met with comments that felt more like judgment. Some elders suggested that I should focus on my spiritual life and not dwell on my husband's fate, as he was not a baptized JW. I remember one elder saying, "You know, he didn't have the truth, so you shouldn't be too upset. He didn't have a hope for the future like we do."     This really struck me. I was grieving the loss of my husband, and instead of compassion, I was met with a cold reminder of the organization's teachings. It felt like they were more concerned about my spiritual standing than my emotional well-being.     I also had a few family members who are JWs reach out, but their conversations often turned into discussions about how I should be focusing on my faith and not on my loss. It was as if they couldn't separate my grief from their beliefs.     Eventually, I found solace in friends outside of the organization who offered genuine support and understanding. They listened to my feelings and allowed me to grieve without trying to impose their beliefs on me. It was a stark contrast to the responses I received from my JW community.     This experience has made me question a lot about the organization and its teachings. I realized that while I had been taught to prioritize the congregation, it was the love and support from those outside of it that truly helped me heal. I’m still navigating my feelings about being a JW and the way the organization handles grief and loss, but I know that I need to prioritize my emotional health and surround myself with those who truly care.
__label__0 https://www.ebay.com/itm/185400012064    The above link says that the item description has changed but luckily I managed to snap the following screenshot the day after it arrived in my mail box: https://i.imgur.com/58O37pF.png    Here is the message I sent him [9 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/ManicRamblings/comments/vuwi3z/i_love_how_mania_allows_you_to_pwn_other_people/) and he responded to me just earlier today:     &gt; Thanks for your supporting,    &gt; Telescopic means that Thrusting, wich come from Sucking,    &gt; Only you active the sucking function, you will feel the thrusting telescpic function,    &gt; So when you received this item, it can work, only you don't like the function way, right?    &gt; Best Regards    I used to sell a lot of stuff on eBay and I know that eBay always sides with the buyer and screws over the seller even when the buyer is "in the wrong" but I just want to make sure that this seller indeed lied about the sex toy's functionality and that I'm not accidentally de-frauding him?    For reference, here is an Amazon sex toy which has [true Telescoping functionality](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QPQ6GBG/) unlike the eBay product I bought whose alleged Telescopic functionality "comes from the suction" (according to his response) apparently???    ___    **TL;DR:** Looking for some fact-checking advice about a "Telescopic" male Sex Toy I purchased from eBay earlier this month... 😅
__label__1 I recently noticed that my laptop screen dims significantly when I’m playing games while it’s plugged in. This only happens during gaming sessions and not when I’m just browsing or using other applications. I’ve checked the power settings and made sure that the brightness is set to maximum, but it still dims.     I’m using a gaming laptop with an NVIDIA graphics card, and I’ve updated all my drivers to the latest version. I also checked the NVIDIA Control Panel to see if there are any settings that might be causing this, but I didn’t find anything that seemed relevant.     Is this a common issue? Could it be related to power management settings or something else? Any advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been on estrogen for a little over a month now, and I have to say, it's been a rough ride. I started noticing some pretty intense pain in my right leg, and it’s been getting worse. At first, I thought it was just muscle soreness from working out, but it feels different. It’s a deep, aching pain that sometimes makes it hard to walk.    I reached out to my doctor, and they suggested that it could be a side effect of the estrogen. They mentioned that some people can experience issues like this, especially if they have a history of blood clots or circulation problems. I don’t have any known issues, but it’s still concerning.    I’m feeling really frustrated because I was so excited to start my transition and feel more like myself, but now I’m worried about how my body is reacting. Has anyone else experienced leg pain or similar issues while on estrogen? What did you do? Did you have to switch medications or adjust your dosage? I’m hoping to find some advice or support from others who might have gone through something similar.    Thanks for reading, and I hope everyone is doing well on their journeys!
__label__1 Today would have marked 60 days sober for me, but I made the decision to reset my counter. I had a rough week, and instead of facing my feelings, I turned to alcohol. It was a moment of weakness, and I’m feeling a mix of disappointment and determination right now.    I know that setbacks are part of the journey, and I’m trying to remind myself that this doesn’t erase the progress I’ve made. I’ve learned so much about myself in the past two months, and I refuse to let this one slip define my path forward.     I’m back to square one, but I’m committed to taking it one day at a time. I’ve reached out to some friends for support and am planning to dive back into my hobbies to keep my mind occupied.     If anyone has tips on how to bounce back after a reset, I’d love to hear them. I’m ready to get back on track and make this next stretch count. IWNDWYT.
__label__0 OP: She/Her    A short update this time mum, but bitter-sweet. I turned 25 on the 6th, 3 weeks after the anniversary of you passing. It was hard without you, being around family didn't help (you know how they can be, how dad is - I love him but he says some off colour things; I've gotten better at calling him out though!). Luckily my wonderful girlfriend was with me, and going to another friends birthday thing that night really helped.    We dropped the bomb that if shit hits the fan in Australia we'll be off to New Zealand, and luckily I can do my degree online! But the big drop was that long-term we're looking at other countries, like Canada, so my partner has better job opportunities (I can be a psychologist anywhere mum, it's okay! I want her to be able to thrive as a game-dev or programmer).    Just wanted to update you, I love you ❤️
__label__0 Does anyone have this problem? I'm used constantly by several acquaintances and family as a dump for their traumas and issues...my mom does this non stop. I've mentioned multiple times and tried to set boundaries but she just keeps going, like a kettle bubbling over. No one trusts her or will listen to her, so it feels like my responsibility. I keep telling her to get a therapist but my advice goes unheeded (she blows it off, or claims she can't afford, yet will go to the casino and bar multiple times per week).     I'm a quiet introvert and I feel like this leads to me be taken advantage of in this way, especially as a (suspected) Aspie. Everyone expects me to just listen, never care about me or my life but just go on and on and on about their things. I'm so exhausted and sick of it. I also lack the necessary social intelligence to respond in an "acceptable" way. Take for instance, an acquaintance was complaining about how they didn't get a job which they felt was due to certain factors, but couldn't conceive it's because they actually are not as good in that role as the person chosen. I didn't tell them this but I also didn't enable their thought process by telling them they were better and should have gotten the job. I expressed sympathy but I think they wanted me to be like hell yeah you deserved it! Is that what you're supposed to say? I'm so fucking clueless it hurts.     How do you prevent and avoid being pigeon holed as the "one will quietly listen" all the time??

__label__0 I’m on mobile, apologies for any weirdness etc etc.    I (18F) have been talking to a guy (19) for about 3 months now. He’s very sweet, very shy, kind of awkward, and very handsome. I like him a lot, and I would like to see this relationship flourish for longer. However, I have always had a history of becoming so unreasonably resentful and critical of the people that I am close to and love, for literally no reason. I really like him, he’s done nothing to make me overtly upset and has always been kind and conscious of my feelings. But I just find myself unreasonably pissed with him all the damn time.     I journal about my feelings, I meditate on what might be the underlying causes of these problems, and I go to therapy and am medicated for MDD, GAD, &amp; PTSD. I still can’t get over this deep seated hate that grows in me every time I start opening up to people. I adore this guy and I know I’ve upset him with my anger although I really do try my best to be conscious about it.     Has anyone else had similar problems? How do I get over it or at least make it more manageable? I hate that I destroy any close relationships I have with the people around me.
__label__1 I've been working on my core and overall fitness for a while now, and I'm really interested in developing my V lines or Adonis belt. However, I'm concerned about the possibility of widening my waist in the process.     I know that achieving visible V lines is largely about reducing body fat and building the right muscles, but I want to make sure that my waist stays relatively slim while I work on this.     Are there specific exercises or training methods that can help me develop my V lines without adding bulk to my waist? Also, how important is diet in this process? Any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been using my BPI credit card for a while now, and I'm curious about the rewards program. I know they offer points for every purchase, but I'm not entirely sure how to maximize the benefits.     For those who have experience with the BPI credit card rewards, what are some tips you can share? Are there specific categories where you earn more points? Also, how do you usually redeem your points?     I've heard that some people use their points for travel or shopping vouchers, but I'm interested in hearing about the best value options. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been playing Dead by Daylight for a while now, and I've noticed that totem spawn locations can really impact the game, especially when it comes to the perks that rely on them. I wanted to start a discussion about the various spawn points for totems across different maps.     For example, on the MacMillan Estate, I often find totems near the large rock formations or behind the main building. Meanwhile, on the Coldwind Farm maps, they seem to spawn more frequently in the cornfields or near the shack.     I think it would be helpful for newer players to know where to look for totems, especially if they’re trying to cleanse or bless them. What are your go-to spots for totem hunting? Have you noticed any patterns in their spawn locations? Let’s share our findings and help each other out!
__label__0 Coming from a figure skating background I have always had a structured boot. I currently have moxi lolly's. I know they are nice skates but unfortunately I just don't think they are the right skate for me. I miss the support of a more structured skate especially for what my favorite skating type is (artistic)     I just paid so much for them and I'm also kinda disappointed with the plate because for the price point I feel like it should be metal not plastic.     Does anyone else feel this way or am I alone? please no hate comments it's just my current opinion  :)
__label__0 I remember reading an alternate history/mythology in which in the distant past there was an Atlantis type advanced civilization in Siberia. Basically, they were a powerful and extensive empire that ruled a vast area of central and northern Eurasia. They used powerful blood based magic and had a thing for human sacrifice.    Eventually the empire collapsed due to some catastrophe brought on by their magics, or perhaps just from constant infighting and civil war.     Their legacy is ancient relics and residual magic that powers some creepy-pasta type phenomena.    Any idea where this alternate civilization is from? Which fandom, website, creepy pasta or creative writing project might this have been from?
__label__1 I've been dealing with long COVID for over a year now, and it's been a tough journey not just physically but also financially. I was wondering if anyone here has found any financial assistance or resources that have helped them cope with the financial burden that comes with long COVID.    I’ve had to cut back on work hours due to fatigue and brain fog, which has significantly impacted my income. I’ve looked into disability benefits, but the process seems daunting and I’m not sure if I qualify. I’ve also heard about some grants or programs specifically for those affected by COVID-19, but I’m not sure where to start looking.    If anyone has successfully navigated this or found any helpful resources, I would really appreciate your insights. It’s been overwhelming trying to manage everything, and I feel like I’m drowning in bills while trying to recover.     Thanks in advance for any advice or support you can offer. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this struggle.

__label__1 I've been reviewing my financial aid package for this year, and I'm really confused about why I'm receiving such a small amount. I thought my family's financial situation would qualify me for more assistance, but it seems like I'm only getting a fraction of what I expected.     Has anyone else experienced this? What steps can I take to appeal or reassess my financial aid? I’ve already submitted my FAFSA and provided all necessary documentation, but I’m not sure what else I can do. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I'm having some trouble with my WiFi and Ethernet connections on my Windows 10 PC. It seems like both drivers are outdated or possibly corrupted, and I'm not sure how to update or reinstall them properly.     I've tried going into Device Manager and updating the drivers, but it says that I have the latest version installed. I also attempted to uninstall the drivers and restart my PC, hoping that Windows would automatically reinstall them, but that didn't work either.     Can anyone guide me on how to manually download and install the latest drivers for both WiFi and Ethernet? Also, if there are specific websites or tools that you recommend for finding the correct drivers, that would be really helpful.     Thanks in advance for your assistance!
__label__0 I've been crushing on a girl since 3rd grade and now I'm a junior, she rejected me before in 7th grade and I lost interest but as soon as she felt pity on me she tried to text me and we talked and became best friends now.    The first time she texted me I regained my interest very fast and we started texting for 3 years until we talked about me having crush on her in the 7th grade ( we never talked about it because she thought I'd be ashamed) but we talked about it 3months ago and told her that I had a crush on her again on 8th and 9th grade (but not the 10th grade ).     I've hinted it for her more than once but she just seems to be confused and beg me to explain the hint which I hid it in a joke.    I don't know what should I do
__label__1 I was playing a run with my friends last night, and we noticed something interesting with the Out With A Bang card. It seems like the explosive damage from the card was stacking in a way we hadn't seen before.     We had a couple of players using it, and when we triggered the explosions, the damage output was significantly higher than expected. It felt like each explosion was amplifying the next one, almost like they were compounding.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a bug, or is there something in the mechanics that allows for this kind of stacking? I know the card is supposed to give you a bang for your buck, but this felt like a whole new level! Would love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has more info on this!

__label__0 I sometimes feel that way when it comes to Italian. I really like the language because of how it sounds and also think it's cool how it's the closest to latin of today's languages (not counting overly obscure languages because I'm sure there are exceptions). But I feel a bit alienated from the Italian culture and also from other people studying Italian. It seems to me that Italians are warm and outgoing and care about fashion, good food and wine. And it seems that people are learning Italian because they have a passion for Italian food or they idioloze the image of a picturesque Italian village and they want to live there and pick fresh lemons from a tree in a backyard...    Long story short, I don't feel like I relate to the Italian culture or to the people learning Italian and that sort of puts me off from learning. I realize this could just be me having preconceived notions that are based on stereotypes and aren't necessarily true. But nonetheless it is a feeling that I have.     Do any of you also experience this or something similar? For Italian or some other language. I was also sort of interested in learning Japanese but I ended up not doing it and I think part of the reason is that I dislike the whole anime phenomenon. Can anyone relate to that specifically?     This might be a sensitive subject and I might come of as pretty judgemental. I apologize in advance and I hope that you can look past my possible ignorance and we can have an honest discussion.

__label__0 Mandatory didn't happen today but i still cringe to this day when i think about it.  This happened around 12 years back when i visited USA for work. As a 22 year old coming from a South Asian country, i was naive and didn't have much idea about the tipping culture so prevalent in the USA. In my country, tipping is not encouraged and a few and far cases would be a restaurant not a cab for sure.  So one fine Monday morning, i took a cab to work in the lovely city of baton rouge . When i reached my destination, the fare was something like 25.35( made up figure).i paid him something like 30 bucks and waited for my change. He said he doesn't have exact change. I checked my purse but since it was my first day, i didn't have any coins on me. The cabby handed me 5 bucks back and muttered," looks like I'll end up tipping you". Ignorant me thought it was some kind of America humour, smiled, took my money and deboarded. I noticed that the cab guy had a weird half disappointed half annoyed look on his face when he took off.  It's only after many years that i realised how deep the tipping culture is. And dinggg... The entire conversation replayed in my mind and i realised what i did.. So dear cabbie, if you are reading this, I'm so sorry for ruining your day. I didn't know.    TL;DR - Didn't know about the tipping culture in the USA, ended up getting a tip from a cab for riding with him.

__label__1 I've been playing Champion of Caldera for a while now, and I think there are a few areas where the game could really improve to enhance the overall experience. Here are my suggestions:    1. **Map Rotation**: While Caldera is beautiful, it can get stale after a while. Introducing a rotation of maps or even seasonal changes to the existing map could keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.    2. **Weapon Balancing**: Some weapons feel overpowered while others are underwhelming. A thorough balance patch could help level the playing field and encourage more diverse loadouts.    3. **Improved Anti-Cheat Measures**: Cheating has been a persistent issue in Warzone. Strengthening anti-cheat systems would help ensure a fairer gaming environment for everyone.    4. **More Game Modes**: Adding new game modes or limited-time events could keep players engaged. Modes like Gun Game or a Battle Royale with unique twists could be fun.    5. **Better Communication Tools**: Enhancing the in-game communication system, such as adding more ping options or voice chat improvements, could help teams coordinate better.    6. **In-Game Tutorials**: For new players, having a more comprehensive tutorial or training mode could help them understand the mechanics and strategies of the game better.    7. **Quality of Life Improvements**: Small tweaks like better inventory management, clearer UI for loadouts, and improved matchmaking could significantly enhance the player experience.    8. **Community Feedback**: Regularly engaging with the community for feedback and suggestions can help developers understand what players want and need.    What do you all think? Are there any other suggestions you would add to this list?
__label__1 I recently started taking Aurovela FE 1/20 as my birth control method, and I wanted to share my experience so far and see if anyone else has had similar or different experiences with it.    Initially, I was a bit nervous about starting a new birth control pill since I had been on a different one for several years and had some side effects that I didn’t want to repeat. However, my doctor recommended Aurovela FE 1/20 because it has a lower dose of hormones, which might help with some of the issues I was facing.    I’ve been on it for about three months now, and I’ve noticed a few things. First, my periods have become much more regular, which is a huge plus for me. They’re also lighter than they were on my previous pill, which is a relief. I’ve had some mild cramping, but nothing too severe.    On the downside, I did experience some initial side effects like nausea and headaches during the first month. Thankfully, those have mostly subsided, and I feel like my body is adjusting to the hormones. I also noticed a slight change in my mood during the first few weeks, but that seems to have leveled out as well.    One thing I’m still trying to figure out is my libido. I’ve read that some people experience a decrease in sex drive with hormonal birth control, and I think I might be experiencing that too. It’s not a huge drop, but it’s noticeable. I’m hoping it will stabilize as I continue taking the pill.    Overall, I’m cautiously optimistic about Aurovela FE 1/20. I’d love to hear from others who have taken it—what has your experience been like? Did you have any side effects, and did they go away over time? Any tips for managing the initial adjustment period would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been setting up my pfSense firewall and I'm a bit confused about how to properly configure firewall rules when it comes to using "real" IP addresses versus private IP addresses.     In my setup, I have a public IP address assigned to my WAN interface, and I want to allow certain traffic from the internet to reach a specific server on my LAN. I understand that I need to create NAT rules to forward the traffic, but I'm unsure about how to handle the firewall rules that follow.    When creating a firewall rule to allow traffic from the WAN to my server, should I be using the public IP address of the WAN interface in the rule, or should I be using the private IP address of the server on the LAN?     Additionally, do I need to create a separate rule for the LAN interface to allow the server to respond back to the internet, or does the NAT rule take care of that?     Any guidance on how to properly set this up would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 So I was high last night and my mom walked in my room unexpectedly. I had just taken a couple of hits from my vape and was feeling pretty good, you know? The room was a bit hazy from the smoke, and I was just chilling on my bed, listening to music.     When she walked in, I panicked a little. I quickly tried to hide the vape under my pillow, but I think she noticed something was off. She asked me what I was doing, and I just froze. My mind was racing, trying to think of a plausible excuse. I ended up saying I was just listening to music and hanging out.     She seemed a bit skeptical but didn't press further. I could see her looking around the room, and I was just praying she wouldn't find the vape. After a few awkward moments, she left, and I felt a huge wave of relief wash over me.     Has anyone else had a close call like this? What did you do? I’m just glad I didn’t get caught, but it definitely made me rethink my smoking habits at home. Any tips on how to be more discreet or handle situations like this in the future?

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I just had a match where I was absolutely racking up the bloodpoints, and I noticed that I ended the game with over 100,000 bloodpoints! I thought there was a cap on how many you could earn in a single match, but it seems like I went way over that limit.     Is there a new update or something that I missed? I remember there used to be a cap of 32,000 for each category (survivor/killer) in a single match, but it looks like that might have changed.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a specific condition that allows for more bloodpoints to be earned? I’m curious if this is a glitch or if the devs have made some adjustments to the bloodpoint system.     Thanks in advance for any insights!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I finally feel ready to take the plunge. I've been using weed as a crutch for too long, and it's time to let it go. I’ve had some great times, but I’ve also experienced the downsides: missed opportunities, strained relationships, and a general feeling of stagnation in my life.     I’ve tried to quit before, but I always found a reason to go back. This time feels different, though. I’ve had some serious moments of reflection, and I realize that I want more for myself. I want to be present in my life, to pursue my passions, and to build meaningful connections with the people around me.     I know it won’t be easy, and I’m sure there will be challenges ahead. But I’m committed to this journey. I plan to take it one day at a time, focusing on healthier habits and finding new ways to cope with stress. I’m also considering joining a support group to help keep me accountable.    If anyone has tips or experiences to share, I’d love to hear them. I’m ready to embrace this change and see where it takes me. Here’s to new beginnings!     Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support you can offer.
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I'm currently looking to enhance my skills in data analytics and I'm based in Hyderabad. I would love to hear your recommendations for any good courses or training programs available in the city.     Specifically, I'm interested in courses that cover topics like data visualization, statistical analysis, and tools like Python, R, or SQL. If you have any personal experiences or know of reputable institutions or online platforms that offer in-person classes, please share!     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 The firefly Edition is awesome but its sold out all the time and limited like hell. And it costs 20 bucks more.    Amazon had an own Steelbook Edition for Part II which did cost 69,99€ (dollar is the same rn as euro).    I was more than happy with that. I hope this won’t become a trend that we don’t get those exclusive steelbooks anymore for future games.     What do you guys think ?   Is it unnecessary or do you wish that there was another physical edition ?
__label__1 Mouse Cursor Issue    Hey fellow PC enthusiasts,    I’m having a frustrating issue with my mouse cursor that I hope someone here can help me with. I recently built a new rig and everything was running smoothly until I noticed that my mouse cursor has started to lag and stutter, especially when I’m playing games or using graphic-intensive applications.    Here are my specs:  - CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X  - GPU: RTX 3080  - RAM: 32GB DDR4  - Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B550-F  - OS: Windows 10    I’ve tried a few troubleshooting steps:  1. Updated all drivers, including the mouse and GPU drivers.  2. Checked for Windows updates and installed the latest patches.  3. Tried different USB ports for my mouse (it’s a wired mouse).  4. Disabled mouse acceleration in Windows settings.  5. Adjusted the polling rate in the mouse software.    Despite all this, the issue persists. The cursor seems to freeze for a split second every few seconds, which is really annoying during gameplay. I’ve also noticed that it happens more frequently when I have multiple applications open.    Has anyone experienced something similar? Any suggestions on what I could try next? I’m starting to wonder if it could be a hardware issue or if there’s something I’m missing in the settings. Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I just wanted to share a little victory with you all. Last night, I went out for dinner with some friends on a Friday night, and I made it through the entire evening without drinking! 🎉    In the past, Friday nights were synonymous with happy hour and cocktails, and I always felt the pressure to join in. But this time, I decided to stick to sparkling water and a delicious mocktail. It felt empowering to be present and enjoy the company of my friends without the haze of alcohol.     I won’t lie, there were moments when I felt a twinge of temptation, especially when I saw my friends enjoying their drinks. But I reminded myself of all the reasons I chose to stop drinking and how much better I feel without it. I focused on the conversations, the laughter, and the food instead.     I’m proud of myself for making this choice, and it’s moments like these that remind me how far I’ve come. If you’re struggling with similar situations, just know it’s possible to enjoy life without alcohol. Here’s to more sober nights out! 🥳
__label__0 Our 3.5 year old toddler turns into a monster when she is woken from her occasional late nap. Kicks, screams, cries.    Any tips on how to calm them down after waking them up ? It’s making me super anxious so I instigate a very early nap when needed/ it never works/I get frustrated/she feels it/we are both in the worst moods ever.    Note : we really need to wake her from late naps, or she won’t go to sleep before 11pm that night
__label__1 I recently ordered a couple of games from Amazon for my Xbox, and I noticed that I haven't received any confirmation email or shipping updates. Is this normal? I usually get an email right after placing an order, but this time nothing has come through. I checked my spam folder and everything, but still nothing.     Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be worried, or is it common for Amazon to delay sending emails sometimes? Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I went to my local Dunkin' today, super excited to grab my favorite Strawberry Frosted donut, but to my dismay, they were out of stock! 😢 I even asked if they could make one without sprinkles, since I prefer it that way, but they said they couldn't do it today.     Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like the Strawberry Frosted is such a classic, and it’s always a bummer when they run out. What’s your go-to donut when your favorite isn’t available? I might need to try something new next time!
__label__1 I just had my very first college class today, and wow, what an experience! I was super nervous walking in, but as soon as I sat down and the professor started talking, I felt a little more at ease. The classroom was way bigger than I expected, and there were so many people!     The professor seems really cool and laid-back, which is a relief. He even joked about how we should all be prepared for the workload, but he also said he’s here to help us succeed. I love that he encourages questions and discussions.     I also met a few people in my class, and we exchanged numbers to form a study group. It’s nice to know I’m not the only one feeling a bit overwhelmed.     Overall, I’m excited but also a little scared about what’s to come. I can’t wait to see how this semester unfolds! Anyone else just starting college? How was your first class?
__label__1 I've been experiencing a frustrating bug with the radar cue in War Thunder lately. It seems that when I lock onto a target, the radar cue doesn't always display correctly, making it difficult to gauge the distance and trajectory for missile launches.     For instance, I was flying my F-14 in a recent match, and while I had a solid lock on an enemy aircraft, the radar cue was showing a range that was way off. I ended up firing an AIM-54, but it missed by a significant margin, and I couldn't figure out why.     Has anyone else encountered this issue? Is there a workaround or a way to reset the radar system mid-flight? I’ve tried toggling the radar on and off, but that doesn’t seem to help. Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been struggling with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) for a while now, and I wanted to share some information that I’ve found helpful, as well as seek advice from others who might be going through the same thing.    **What is BDD?**    Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a mental health condition where a person becomes preoccupied with perceived flaws in their appearance, which are often not noticeable to others. This can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily functioning.     **Criteria for Diagnosis:**    According to the DSM-5, the criteria for BDD include:    1. A preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others.    2. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (like mirror checking, excessive grooming, or seeking reassurance) or mental acts (like comparing their appearance to others) in response to the appearance concerns.    3. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.    4. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet the criteria for an eating disorder.    **Self-Help Strategies:**    - **Journaling:** Keeping a journal can help track your thoughts and feelings about your appearance. It can also help identify triggers that worsen your BDD symptoms.    - **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This can reduce the power of negative thoughts about your appearance.    - **Limit Mirror Checking:** Try to reduce the amount of time you spend checking your appearance in mirrors or reflective surfaces. This can help break the cycle of negative thoughts.    - **Focus on Positive Attributes:** Make a list of things you like about yourself that are not related to appearance. This can help shift your focus away from your perceived flaws.    **Support Groups:**    Connecting with others who understand what you’re going through can be incredibly helpful. Here are a few resources:    - **BDD Foundation:** They offer support groups and resources for individuals struggling with BDD.    - **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** They provide information on local support groups and resources for mental health issues, including BDD.    - **Online Forums:** Websites like Reddit and other mental health forums can provide a space to share experiences and advice with others who have BDD.    I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with BDD. What strategies have you found helpful? Are there any resources you would recommend? Let’s support each other in this journey.

__label__0 Does anyone know why my dog lets white people and Asians pet him but as soon as he sees a black or Hispanic person he wants to rip there head off
__label__0 Hi there, I burned my hand 5 days ago with steam while cooking. Unfortunately I was holding the lid of a heavy cast iron pot when it happened, and I didn’t want to drop it (expensive and the pot wasn't mine), so I held my hand in the steam for far longer than I should have. The day/night it happened had excruciating pain that wouldn’t cease unless I put it in cool water (and even then it was still burning). However, once blisters formed in the following days, the burning sensation subsided for the most part. Now it’s just super itchy. Just wondering what type of burn this is and how long it’ll take to heal. Attached are photos of an hour after it happened (its wet from soaking it in water) and then today (please excuse the cat hair on my hands!). I haven't seen a doctor (as I thought it's too small to see one), but I've been applying a cream called burnaid every now and then. Is there anything else I should be doing? I've never had a burn this bad before. Thank you!    https://preview.redd.it/p90to252vtm51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67bdecd5d0c41b523bc9de97e868110312611646    https://preview.redd.it/kdzl59vzutm51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da50a047ec6ebe5eb578234ea2c8238d7cf71f55
__label__1 I've been dealing with tinnitus for a while now, and I've been trying to figure out what might have caused it. Recently, I started wondering if it could be related to my blood vessels.     I read somewhere that sometimes blood vessels can grow too close to the eardrums or even become more prominent, which might lead to pulsatile tinnitus or other types of ringing in the ears. Has anyone else experienced this or heard of it happening?     I’m curious if there are any tests or examinations that can confirm if this is the case. I’ve been to an ENT, but I didn’t get a clear answer on whether vascular issues could be a contributing factor to my tinnitus.     If anyone has insights or experiences related to this, I would really appreciate your input. Thanks!

__label__1 I've been eagerly waiting for the "No Way Home: More Fun Stuff Version" to hit theaters, and I was wondering if anyone has any updates on when the tickets will go on sale.

I want to make sure I get my tickets as soon as they drop!
__label__0 Look, positive opening - he doesn't destroy stuff like I was told a 'bored' Jack Russell would. So I'm now able to leave him around the house for a couple of hours while I go out to the gym - which I need to because all of my previous gym gains are gone after a winter of "The Shining" with my pup and I'm starting to get a belly with all the food I have to eat to keep up with him. He's 10 months this week and I honestly thought the teenage phase was behind him after a few good days and a some good behaviour with other dogs.    Nope! Still couldn't give a shit if I'm there or not. Can concentrate on heel-walking for about 5 minutes before "Nope, too hard. I'm off - cya!". Won't eat his food (might be the heat) but will hassle me when I'm making mine, in case there's some bacon in the offering.    I'd be fine with that but I'm trying to get in shape, as I said, and today I'm just exhausted from my first body pump class and I have 0 patience, but the dog needs his enrichment or he might choose violence.    I think the worst part is, he *knows* I'm in a bad mood, so he's on edge and tense. It's not his fault, it's just hormones, I just really would like not to feel like every day is a massive struggle, please.

__label__0 Lets say, I created 100 new Armored Artillery equipments. If I were to add a battalion of them to my tank divison, I would need 300 total to roll them out to the units in the field. Now, all of my tank divisions will not be at full strength, since I don't have enough equipment. Does this matter? Is there a combat penalty for being behind in equipment, or would they just not have all the stats from the missing tanks?

__label__1 I’ve always been a bit different from my peers, and I think that’s what led me to discover my special interest. It started when I was around 7 years old. I remember being fascinated by dinosaurs after watching a documentary on them. I would spend hours reading books, drawing pictures, and even collecting dinosaur figurines.     As I grew older, my interests shifted, but the pattern remained the same. I would latch onto something that sparked my curiosity and dive deep into it. For example, I became obsessed with space and astronomy during my teenage years. I would stay up late at night, gazing at the stars and learning about the universe.     I think what really helped me find my special interests was the freedom to explore without judgment. My parents encouraged my curiosity and allowed me to pursue what I loved, even if it seemed unusual to others.     Now, I have a few special interests that I rotate through, including coding, graphic design, and even a bit of history. Each one brings me joy and a sense of purpose. I often wonder if others have similar experiences in finding their special interests. How did you discover yours?

__label__1 Water retention, or edema, can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to maintain a healthy weight or improve your fitness. Here are some effective strategies to help manage and reduce water retention:    1. **Stay Hydrated**: It may seem counterintuitive, but drinking plenty of water can actually help reduce water retention. When your body is dehydrated, it tends to hold onto more water. Aim for at least 8-10 cups of water a day, and more if you're active.    2. **Reduce Sodium Intake**: High sodium levels can cause your body to retain water. Try to limit processed foods, which are often high in salt, and opt for fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains instead. When cooking, use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt.    3. **Increase Potassium-Rich Foods**: Potassium helps balance sodium levels in the body and can promote fluid balance. Foods rich in potassium include bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados.    4. **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity can help improve circulation and reduce fluid buildup. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, including both cardio and strength training.    5. **Consider Natural Diuretics**: Certain foods and herbs can act as natural diuretics, helping your body expel excess water. Examples include dandelion tea, green tea, and foods like cucumber, watermelon, and asparagus.    6. **Manage Stress**: High stress levels can lead to hormonal changes that may increase water retention. Incorporate stress-reducing activities into your routine, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.    7. **Get Enough Sleep**: Poor sleep can affect your body’s fluid balance. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to help regulate hormones and reduce water retention.    8. **Consult a Doctor**: If you notice persistent or severe water retention, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional. It could be a sign of an underlying health issue that needs to be addressed.    By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can help manage water retention effectively. Remember, it’s always best to approach changes gradually and listen to your body.
__label__1 I (28F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for about two years now. Overall, things are good, but there’s one thing that’s been bothering me lately, and I’m struggling to not let it affect my mood.     My boyfriend has a very demanding job that often requires him to work long hours and be on call. I completely understand that his work is important and that he has to prioritize it, but it often leaves me feeling neglected and unimportant. When he’s busy, he tends to be less communicative, and I find myself feeling anxious and lonely.     I’ve tried to talk to him about it, and he reassures me that it’s not personal and that he cares about me, but when I don’t hear from him for hours or even days, it’s hard not to feel like I’m not a priority in his life. I know he’s working hard for our future, but I can’t help but feel a bit resentful and sad when I see other couples spending time together or being more connected.     I want to be supportive and understanding, but I also don’t want to let this situation bring me down. I’ve been trying to find ways to cope, like focusing on my hobbies, spending time with friends, and practicing self-care, but I still find myself feeling low when he’s unavailable.     How can I better manage my feelings and not let his work schedule affect my mood? I want to be happy and supportive, but I also need to take care of my own emotional well-being. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been playing Dead by Daylight for a while now, and I’ve tried out a bunch of killers, but I have to say that my favorite has to be the Trickster. There’s just something so satisfying about throwing those knives and watching survivors panic as they try to dodge them.     His playstyle is super unique compared to other killers. The ability to throw knives from a distance allows for some really fun mind games, especially when you can predict where the survivors are going to run. Plus, the music and aesthetic of the Trickster really add to the overall experience.     I also love how he can be both a ranged and a melee killer. Once you get a survivor injured with your knives, you can chase them down and finish them off with your basic attack. It keeps the gameplay dynamic and exciting.     What about you all? Who do you think is the most fun killer to play? I’d love to hear your thoughts and maybe some tips on how to improve my Trickster gameplay!
__label__0 * TRIGGER WARNING : SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SELF-HARM*    I have to be in contact with the man who sexually assaulted me in about a month and I’m dreading it because it’s a family wedding that I cannot get out of attending. My family doesn’t know that I was assaulted and I can’t tell them whatsoever. I’ve been really triggered and concerned for my safety. I don’t know how to cope and I’m trying my best to not SH. My nightmares are getting worse each night and idek how to make them stop. I’m currently not on medication, but I am in therapy. I feel really sad over everything. My dad did not have a good reaction to me telling him about my trauma and I can’t trust anyone in my family enough to let them know.
__label__1 Hey everyone! With the NVidia GTC 2022 keynote just around the corner, I thought it would be great to have a megathread where we can discuss all the announcements, updates, and our thoughts on the new technologies that NVidia will unveil.    The keynote is expected to cover a range of topics, including advancements in AI, gaming technologies, and possibly new hardware announcements. I'm particularly excited to see if they will reveal any new GPUs or updates to the RTX series, especially considering the current demand and supply issues in the market.    Feel free to share your predictions, what you hope to see, and any live updates during the keynote! Let’s keep this thread active with all the latest news and discussions.     Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts!
__label__1 I can't believe they removed budget adjustments again in FIFA 23! It feels like every time they make a change, it's one step forward and two steps back. I really enjoyed being able to tweak my budget to fit my team's needs, and now it feels like we're back to square one.     I just wish EA would listen to the community more. There are so many great ideas out there that could really enhance the Career Mode experience. I can't help but think that if a serious contender came along, it would push EA to step up their game.     Has anyone else felt this frustration? What features do you think are essential for a great Career Mode? Let's hope they make some changes in the future!
__label__1 I've been a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! for a while now, but there's one question that I've always wanted to ask and never really found a clear answer to. So here it goes: What exactly is the difference between the TCG (Trading Card Game) and the OCG (Official Card Game)?     I know they both involve the same core gameplay mechanics and cards, but I've heard that there are differences in card availability, ban lists, and even some rules.     For example, I’ve seen some cards that are legal in the OCG but banned in the TCG, and vice versa. I’m also curious about how the release schedules differ between the two.     I hope this question doesn’t come off as too basic, but I’d really appreciate any insights or explanations from the community! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm an Aussie looking to make some new friends and have some good conversations. I love exploring the outdoors, going to the beach, and trying out new foods. I'm also a big fan of sports, especially AFL and cricket.     In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music (huge fan of indie and rock), and reading a good book. I'm always up for a chat about anything, whether it's about life, travel, or just sharing funny stories.     If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out! Looking forward to meeting some new people!
__label__1 I think my reaction would depend on a few factors, including my own values and what I’m looking for in a partner. If she said she wanted to be a housewife and was serious about it, I would respect her choice. Everyone has different aspirations and life goals, and being a housewife can be a fulfilling role for many people.     However, I would also want to understand her reasoning behind that choice. Is it something she genuinely wants, or is it influenced by societal expectations? I’d be curious to know what her vision of being a housewife looks like—does she see it as a full-time commitment, or does she have other interests and passions she wants to pursue alongside it?     Ultimately, I think it’s important to have open conversations about our goals and aspirations, especially early on in a relationship. If her desire to be a housewife aligns with my own values and future plans, then it could be a good match. But if I’m looking for a partner who has career ambitions or a different lifestyle in mind, it might lead to some deeper discussions about compatibility.
__label__0 I have been on Wellbutrin for 8 months. The doctor prescribed it for depression and insomnia. I feel like it may have made my anxiety worse (obsessional thoughts), so I am coming off of it slowly.

Is there a particular time of year that’s best to go? Any tips for making the most of the visit? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 As someone who has identified as an Asian Democrat in the past, I have witnessed firsthand how the progressive agenda is increasingly alienating many in our community. The push for radical policies that prioritize identity politics over unity is not only divisive but also detrimental to the values that many of us hold dear.     Progressives often claim to champion diversity, yet they seem to ignore the voices of those who do not fit their narrative. They label anyone who disagrees with them as a traitor to their race or culture, which is not only insulting but also counterproductive. We need to stand up against this toxic environment that seeks to silence dissent and promote a one-size-fits-all ideology.     It's time for us to reclaim our narrative and advocate for policies that truly benefit all Americans, regardless of race. We should focus on education, economic opportunity, and community engagement rather than being pitted against each other in a never-ending culture war.     Let’s unite and fight back against the progressive agenda that seeks to divide us. We can be proud of our heritage while also embracing the values of hard work, personal responsibility, and freedom that have made this country great. Together, we can build a future that respects our differences while promoting unity and prosperity for all.
__label__0 Just as my question describes, I own a Quest 2 so I plan on saving for a HTC Vive eventually when I get a decent job. I was wondering this because I want to play more Beat Saber and get better at it, it's been helping me allot with getting muscles and losing stress, etc. And making me sore. lol. And I've been playing Skyrim VR also with mods. I like Questing, etc. It's fun. Loving it. \^\_\^ VR Best thing that's ever happened TBH. \^\_\^ I'm completely out of shape and I am currently have social anxiety so it's hard for me to get out and walk about, etc. So VR has been helping me treat my social anxiety and even improved my communication skills in VR Chat too. It changed my life so I am wondering if anyone has any same experiences as me. Thanks! :)
__label__1 My dad has always been my rock, but ever since the pandemic hit, things have taken a turn for the worse. He lost his job due to COVID-19 and has been struggling to find work ever since. We’ve been trying to make ends meet, but it’s been really tough.     I’m currently working part-time, but my income isn’t enough to cover all the bills and groceries. I feel helpless seeing him stressed and worried about our situation. I want to do everything I can to help him, but I’m not sure where to start.     If anyone has any advice on resources for job hunting, financial assistance, or even just ways to support him emotionally during this tough time, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
__label__1 I'm currently working in finance but I'm considering a shift to a fully remote position. I know that many roles in tech, customer service, and marketing offer remote opportunities, but I'm curious about what other fields or specific jobs are available for remote work.     For those of you who have made the transition to remote work, what roles have you found that allow for flexibility and a good work-life balance? Are there any particular companies or industries that are more open to remote positions?     Additionally, if anyone has tips on how to effectively search for remote jobs or any resources that have helped them in their job search, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I recently went through a breakup, and I've been wondering if my ex feels any remorse or sympathy for me. We ended things on somewhat amicable terms, but I can't shake the feeling that they might not care about how I'm doing.     I see them posting on social media, living their life, and it makes me question if they ever think about me or feel bad about how things ended. I know it's not healthy to dwell on this, but I can't help but wonder if they have any regrets or if they feel sorry for how things turned out for me.     Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it's common for exes to feel sorry for their former partners after a breakup, or is it more likely that they just move on without a second thought?

__label__0 title says it all. i had to be hospitalized after having a day where my panic would just not stop, progressively getting worse every time i tried to calm it down. my panic started getting physical and thats NEVER happened before— tight chest, choked up, unable to stop sobbing, i genuinely thought i was dying and having a heart attack. after numerous tests and hours in the hospital, everything came out perfect but now im here two days later, still suffering. no longer panicking but my chest is tight, sometimes it gets harder to breathe, yesterday i couldnt get out of bed at all from how tired and on edge i was.    im not on medications and as much as i know i need them (my anxiety and panic attacks have gotten terrible over the past year), im ridiculously scared of intake. theres just so many things that can go wrong. im making this post in efforts to calm myself and stop the pressure in my chest but its ridiculously difficult and sometimes it feels like it’ll never get better, or something is actually physically wrong with me.      i guess my question is, is all of this normal? these physical symptoms, this fear, this panic hangover that i just cannot shake?
__label__1 I'm working on a Flutter app that uses a WebView, and I need to handle responses from the web content back to my Flutter code. Specifically, I want to execute some Dart code based on certain events or data received from the web page.     I've set up my WebView using the `webview_flutter` package, and I can load the web page without any issues. However, I'm struggling with how to implement a callback mechanism to receive messages from the web content.     Here's a simplified version of my code:    ```dart  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';  import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';    class MyWebView extends StatefulWidget {    @override    _MyWebViewState createState() => _MyWebViewState();  }    class _MyWebViewState extends State<MyWebView> {    late WebViewController _controller;      @override    Widget build(BuildContext context) {      return Scaffold(        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WebView Callback Example')),          body: WebView(          initialUrl: 'https://your-web-page.com',          javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted,          onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController webViewController) {            _controller = webViewController;          },          javascriptChannels: <JavascriptChannel>{            JavascriptChannel(              name: 'Flutter',              onMessageReceived: (JavascriptMessage message) {                // Handle the message received from the web page                print('Message from web: ${message.message}');                // You can also call other Dart functions here              },            ),          },        ),      );    }  }  ```    In my web page, I want to send a message back to Flutter using JavaScript. Here's an example of how I would do that:    ```javascript  function sendMessageToFlutter() {    Flutter.postMessage('Hello from the web!');  }  ```    The issue I'm facing is that the `JavascriptChannel` doesn't seem to be receiving the messages as expected. I've double-checked the channel name and the JavaScript function, but I'm not seeing any output in the console.     Has anyone successfully implemented a callback from a WebView to Flutter? Any tips or examples would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I need some relationship advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years, but he still keeps tabs on his ex-girlfriend via Instagram and Snapchat . They were engaged and lost both their virginities to each other.  They broke up six years ago and had no contact for four years after the breakup. He reached out to her 2 years ago (a month before we started officially dating) and began talking to her. They have each other on social media and I thought nothing about it at first. After one year and a half of dating, we bought a house together which was exciting. I just don’t know if he’s actually moved on. He’s only mentioned our relationship publicly on social media twice and didn’t even include my face, while I’ve frequently posted a lot about us. He’s still been keeping connection with her for the ENTIRE duration of our relationship. He even liked a bikini pic of hers on Instagram.  Is this healthy? Would you consider this to be cheating?

__label__1 I (28F) have been with my partner (30M) for about five years now, and we have a pretty open and honest relationship. However, there’s something from my past that I’ve never fully shared with him. In my early twenties, I went through a phase where I was quite promiscuous. I had a lot of casual relationships and flings, and while I don’t regret those experiences, I’ve always felt a bit embarrassed about that part of my life.    My partner knows that I’ve had relationships before him, but I’ve never gone into detail about how many or the nature of those relationships. I worry that if I tell him about my past, he might judge me or see me differently. I’ve heard stories of people who have been open about their pasts and it has caused issues in their relationships, and I don’t want to risk that.    On the other hand, I feel like it’s important to be completely honest with him. I don’t want to hide a part of myself, especially since we’re planning to get married in the near future. I’m torn between wanting to be transparent and fearing his reaction.     Should I tell him about my past? How do I approach this conversation without making it awkward or uncomfortable? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What was the outcome?
__label__1 I've heard about this sex move where guys supposedly fish hook a girl's mouth during oral sex, and I'm really confused about it. Is this a common thing? What does it even mean? I can't imagine it being pleasurable for anyone involved, and it sounds kind of painful or degrading.     Is this something that people actually do, or is it just a weird rumor? If it is a real thing, what’s the appeal? I feel like I might be missing something here, and I just want to understand if this is a normal part of sexual experiences for some people or if it's just something that should be avoided.     Thanks for any insights!
__label__1 I've been working on a handy cheatsheet for Pathfinder 2e that compiles essential rules, conditions, and actions into a single, easy-to-read format. I thought it might be useful for both new and experienced players at the table!     The cheatsheet includes:  - **Basic Actions**: A quick reference for common actions like Stride, Strike, and Interact.  - **Conditions**: A summary of all conditions and their effects, making it easier to remember what each one does during gameplay.  - **Combat Rules**: Key rules for combat, including critical hits, flanking, and cover.  - **Spellcasting**: A brief overview of how spellcasting works, including spell slots and heightened spells.    I've also included some images that illustrate various aspects of the game, such as the action economy and a visual guide to the different types of actions.     You can find the cheatsheet and images here: [Cheatsheet Link](#) (please replace with actual link).     Feel free to print it out or save it on your device for quick reference during your sessions! I hope this helps streamline your gameplay and enhances your Pathfinder experience. Let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions for improvements!
__label__1 I just took the MCAT on 8/26 and I swear some of the questions felt like they were written in ancient hieroglyphs! 🤯 Like, I was staring at this one passage trying to decipher what they were even asking.     For example, there was a question about a study involving a rare species of fish and its mating habits, and then they threw in some complex biochemical pathways that had nothing to do with the passage! I felt like I needed a degree in archaeology just to understand the context.     Anyone else feel like they were decoding a secret language during the exam? How did you handle those tricky passages? Any tips for future test-takers on how to tackle those confusing questions? Let's share our experiences!
__label__0 So I’m just wondering. Resources wise I don’t have the books or mora to build another character. I really like the 4 stars this upcoming banner and could use their cons. I have Zhong. Should I pull on tighnari banner and build him whenever I get the chance? Or should I pull on zhongs banner? Im mostly just pulling for the 4 star cons. Or should I just save for Kokomi as that’s the character I want?
__label__1 When it comes to badass character introductions, one scene that stands out is from the anime "Attack on Titan" featuring Levi Ackerman. The moment he steps onto the battlefield, the atmosphere shifts. The way he effortlessly takes down multiple Titans with his unparalleled speed and skill is nothing short of jaw-dropping. The animation, combined with the intense music, creates a sense of awe and excitement that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats.     Another iconic intro is from "My Hero Academia" with All Might's first transformation. The sheer power and charisma he exudes when he reveals his true form is electrifying. His larger-than-life persona and the way he inspires hope in others is a defining moment in the series.     What are some of your favorite badass character introductions? Let’s discuss those epic moments that made you shout "YES!" in excitement!

__label__0 Greetings all,    Looking to leverage new line/port-in deals on both T-Mobile and Verizon; long story short my partner and I each maintain two lines (personal and business) on our respective carriers, I'm the Verizon guy and she's the T-Mobile gal....    .... we want to swap the business lines between our accounts so we each have carrier redundancy.  In my case I dual sim an unlocked iPhone 13 Pro, so my end of this is easy (that device currently has two Verizon lines on it), in her case she carries two devices (Galaxy A71 and iPhone 11 Pro) that we'd like to upgrade.    I'm thinking something like this:    1. My business line gets ported from Verizon to T-Mobile.  We purchase a new device under T-Mobile's new line/port-in promo, activate it, then swap sims to move it to her personal line (staying on T-Mobile) and (re)activate my line on my iPhone 13 Pro.  2. Her business line gets ported from T-Mobile to Verizon.  We purchase a new device under Verizon's current promos for new lines/port-ins, which is an "up to $800 credit" for her iPhone 11 Pro (sales says we'd qualify for full amount).  It simply gets activated, no need for device swap here.    My concern is with the sheer number of horror stories I've read in this sub and elsewhere about people getting screwed over by Verizon on device trade-ins.  Sales chat claims we'll get the full $800 of the "up to $800" for her iPhone 11 Pro but they can't tell me which local stores will accept a trade in (apparently some do and others want it done via mail?) and I am utterly terrified to do it via mail due to the aforementioned stories.    Any thoughts/suggestions?  Is there a better way to accomplish the goal (swap the two lines for carrier redundancy and get my partner the best possible deal on new devices) than my idea above?  How can we protect ourselves on the trade-in front if it can't be done locally?    Also, if anyone is curious, I [posted the T-Mobile side of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/vhiy5z/portin_promomoving_devices/) in their sub.

__label__1 I was thinking about how fun it would be to have a Mozambique-only mode in Apex Legends. Just imagine dropping into Kings Canyon or Storm Point with only the Mozambique available! It would definitely change the dynamics of the game and force players to get creative with their strategies.     We could have a limited-time event where everyone has to use the Mozambique, and maybe even add some fun challenges like getting a certain number of kills or revives with it. It would be hilarious to see how players adapt to the challenge and try to outsmart each other with just this weapon. Plus, it could be a great way to give some love to the Mozambique, which often gets a bad rap.     What do you all think? Would you be down for a Mozambique-only mode? How do you think it would play out?
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about the current state of monthly comic book series and how so many of them seem to be written with the trade paperback in mind. It feels like a lot of stories are structured to be collected into a single volume, which can sometimes lead to pacing issues and a lack of immediate stakes in the individual issues.     But are there any series out there that feel like they are genuinely crafted for the monthly format? I miss the days when comics would leave you on a cliffhanger at the end of each issue, making you eagerly anticipate the next installment.     For example, I think of titles like "Daredevil" by Chip Zdarsky, which has had some arcs that feel very much like they are designed to be read month-to-month, with each issue building on the last in a way that keeps the tension high.     What are some of your favorite ongoing series that you feel are written for the monthly format? Do you think the trend of writing for the trade is a detriment to the medium, or do you enjoy the way stories are being told now? Let's discuss!

__label__1 Preparing for the Step 2 CK can be daunting, especially if you're aiming for a score of 250 or higher. Here are some tips that helped me and might help you too:    1. **Create a Study Schedule**: Start by mapping out a 5-month study plan. Break down your subjects and allocate time for each. Make sure to include time for practice questions and NBME exams.    2. **Use High-Yield Resources**: Stick to high-yield resources like UWorld, First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK, and Online MedEd. These materials are well-regarded and cover the essential topics you need to know.    3. **Practice Questions**: UWorld is your best friend. Aim to complete it at least twice. Focus on understanding the rationale behind each question, not just memorizing the answers. Make sure to review your incorrect answers thoroughly.    4. **Take NBME Practice Exams**: Schedule NBME practice exams every few weeks to gauge your progress. This will help you identify weak areas and adjust your study plan accordingly. Aim for a minimum of 3-4 full-length practice exams.    5. **Active Learning Techniques**: Engage in active learning by teaching concepts to others, discussing cases with peers, or using flashcards. This helps reinforce your understanding and retention of material.    6. **Clinical Vignettes**: Familiarize yourself with clinical vignettes as they are a significant part of the exam. Practice integrating clinical knowledge with basic science concepts.    7. **Stay Healthy**: Don’t neglect your physical and mental health. Exercise regularly, eat well, and ensure you get enough sleep. Taking care of your body will help you stay focused and energized.    8. **Join a Study Group**: If possible, join a study group. Discussing topics with peers can provide new insights and help clarify difficult concepts.    9. **Simulate Exam Conditions**: When taking practice exams, simulate real exam conditions. Time yourself and avoid distractions to get used to the pressure of the actual test.    10. **Stay Positive and Motivated**: Keep a positive mindset. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and remind yourself of your goals. Celebrate small victories along the way to keep your motivation high.    Remember, consistency is key. Stick to your study plan, and don’t hesitate to adjust it as needed. Good luck with your preparation!

__label__1 I've been trying to get my hair healthier and shinier, and I've heard that oiling can really help with that. However, I'm a bit confused about the best practices for oiling my hair.     1. **What type of oil should I use?** I've heard good things about coconut oil, argan oil, and castor oil, but I'm not sure which one would be best for my hair type. I have straight, medium-thick hair that tends to get oily at the roots but dry at the ends.    2. **How often should I oil my hair?** Is it okay to do it every week, or should I space it out more?     3. **How do I apply the oil?** Should I focus on the scalp, the ends, or both? And how much oil should I use?     4. **How long should I leave it in?** Is there a recommended time for letting the oil sit before washing it out?     5. **Any tips for washing it out?** I’ve heard that sometimes it can be hard to get all the oil out, so any advice on that would be appreciated!    Thanks in advance for your help! I'm excited to start this journey to healthier hair!

__label__1 Has anyone else had a near-death experience with Lidl's new trolleys? I swear, they must have been designed by someone who hates shoppers!     First off, the wheels are so wobbly that I feel like I’m steering a dodgy go-kart rather than a shopping trolley. I nearly took out an entire display of baked beans the other day because the thing just veered off to the left without warning.     And don’t even get me started on the size! They’re so narrow that I can barely fit my shopping in without it spilling out all over the floor. I had a loaf of bread and a pack of biscuits go flying last week, and I’m pretty sure I heard someone snicker as I scrambled to pick them up.     I get that they’re trying to save costs, but come on! I’d rather pay a bit more for a trolley that doesn’t feel like it’s going to throw me into the frozen food aisle at any moment. Anyone else feel like they’re risking life and limb just to grab a few groceries?      What’s the deal, Lidl? Can we get some trolleys that don’t feel like they’re out to get us?

Here are a few specific questions I have:    - **Drum Patterns:** What kind of kick and snare patterns are typically used in these genres? Do you have any tips on layering sounds to achieve that punchy feel?  - **Bass Lines:** How do you create those groovy bass lines that seem to drive the track? Any specific techniques or plugins you recommend?  - **Chords and Melodies:** What kind of chord progressions work well in classic house and disco? How do you approach melody writing in this style?    Any advice, tutorials, or resources you could share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 Just finished this Neo Japanese style tattoo! I had a blast working on this piece, which features a koi fish swimming upstream surrounded by cherry blossoms. The colors really pop, and I love how the flow of the design captures the movement of the water.     This was done by me, Fava.tattooer, in Brooklyn, NY. I’m always inspired by traditional Japanese art, and I try to bring a modern twist to it in my work. Let me know what you think!     #tattoo #neojapanese #koi #cherryblossom #tattooartist #brooklyn

__label__1 Hey fellow degenerates!     I thought it would be fun to create a little dictionary to help newcomers (and maybe some veterans) understand the unique vocabulary we use here on WallStreetBets. Let’s build this together! Here are some terms to get us started:    1. **Diamond Hands** - Refers to someone who holds onto their stocks through thick and thin, no matter how volatile the market gets. They’re not selling, even if the price drops like a rock.    2. **Paper Hands** - The opposite of diamond hands. This is someone who sells their stocks at the first sign of trouble. They’re often seen as weak or cowardly in the WSB community.    3. **YOLO** - You Only Live Once. This is the mantra for making risky trades, often with a significant portion of one’s portfolio. It’s all about going big or going home!    4. **FOMO** - Fear Of Missing Out. This is the anxiety that comes from seeing others make money and feeling like you need to jump in on a trade before it’s too late.    5. **Tendies** - Refers to profits or gains from trading. The term comes from the idea that making money in the stock market is like earning chicken tenders as a reward.    6. **Stonks** - A humorous misspelling of stocks, often used to describe a stock that is going up or to mock the absurdity of the market.    7. **Apes** - Refers to retail investors who band together to support a stock, often used in the context of meme stocks like $GME or $AMC. "Apes strong together!"    8. **Short Squeeze** - A situation where a heavily shorted stock’s price rises sharply, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, which in turn drives the price even higher.    9. **HODL** - Originally a misspelling of "hold," it has become an acronym for "Hold On for Dear Life." It’s a rallying cry for those who refuse to sell their assets, no matter what.    10. **Gamma Squeeze** - A phenomenon that occurs when a stock’s price rises sharply due to options trading, particularly when market makers have to buy shares to hedge their positions.    Let’s keep adding to this list! What other terms do you think should be included? Drop your suggestions below and let’s make this the ultimate WSB vocabulary guide! 🚀💎🙌
__label__0 I (18nb) have been dating my boyfriend (18m) for a month now and things between us have been doing great with the exemption of me wanting to break up.     I met my boyfriend (let’s call him J) on one of my friends birthday party’s. He’s one of his classmate’s and was a real help to me since I felt really nervous to meet everyone there since most of the people at the party where my friends classmates and I have never met them in person before. He helped easing me up a bit and the alcohol helped with the rest.  We got so drunk that we ended up laying on the couch, holding hands and talking gibberish till we fell asleep.    After that we decided to add each other on Snapchat and go hangout some times. We did just that and went out sometimes and me being the idiot that I am though we were just hanging out but apparently J thought we were going out on dates. I only found this out through my friend who was asking me how things were doing between us. At fist I thought “wow! So he’s actually interested in me that’s amazing!” So I went along with it, after all J is a pretty sweet guy!   He’s fun to talk to, understood quickly that meeting new people made me anxious and has been nothing but respectful to me.   For example his parents asked me if I wanted to join them for a family trip, I said sure and there we went. I was very nervous to meet them but throughout the trip J made sure that I was comfortable and made sure that I was alright.    So after constantly going out on dates for two weeks I really thought I have found the guy for me. We’ve hold hands, cuddled, shared our first kiss so when he asked me to be his partner I, without thinking instantly said yes. I was so excited, after all J is my very first boyfriend but after dating for a while I wasn’t so sure anymore.    For the past view week I’ve been busy trying to settle things with the state and trying to get a job since I decided to quit school and haven’t had the time to meet up with him. J has tried to ask on multiple occasions if I had time to go out with him again and I constantly had to decline since I was socially burnt out by having to go to multiple appointments. I knew he was disappointed with the lack of contact we had now so i tried to force my social battery to let me function for a bit more to call him and play an online game with him.     Throughout that time I started to feel overwhelmed? With my mom constantly nagging me to finish some papers so I can send them out to the state to feeling the need to satisfy my boyfriend for the lack of contact. With me starting to feel guilty for not being able to meet up with J, it fells like I’m carrying something heavy on my shoulders and with that came the thoughts of regretting(?) being in a relationship.     With every call with J I fell more like I’m pretending to be alright with our relationship and to be honest the thought of breaking up has been plaguing my mind. I came to realize that maybe I’m not ready for a relationship or that our relationship has moved on to quickly. I honestly feel like crying for wanting to break up with him because he’s been nothing but good to me, from introducing me to his parents and easily getting along with mine I can’t bare the thought of breaking up but I don’t want him to be with someone who is feeling the need to pretend to be his partner.    I feel like such an huge asshole but I don’t know what else to do.  Please help.    P.s. I’m not sure if I wrote this correctly or not but I hope that people can still understand the situation I’m stuck in.

__label__0 22 Female 155lbs 5’3”  Tennessee       Hi all,     I’m struggling with severe head pain. I was having a bit of weird brain fog, pins and needles, nausea, fatigue and moderate headaches over the last 5 days. I do suffer from chronic migraines, this is not the same. Well today, I woke up and had severe pain and suffering from head pressure as if my brain is swollen and needs to pop. If I press on a part of the back of my head, I get pins and needles in my head and face. I felt like I was in a dream-like state and was absolutely suffering, I was freaking out and my chest/breathing was tightened. I went to the ER scared I was having a stroke or aneurysm, but I had a CT scan and I was cleared of any abnormalities or bleeding. My vitals were checked and they were also cleared from being a cause. I swear what I am feeling is not normal!! I asked for a blood test in case I had an infection, nothing. I’m still suffering, 9 hours later. I’m not in severe pain since the ER gave me strong meds but I still feel a huge amount of pressure in my head, as if my brain is ready to jump out of my skull.   I’m not sure what’s going on.
__label__0 Howdy folks, I recently purchased some very expensive, very high quality potting soil and neglected to read that it is for outdoor use. I repotted a number of my -indoor- plants and within a week, I’d been overwhelmed with hoards of fungus gnats! Even weeks later with treatment and many nematodes, I still find a few flying around daily. I have accepted my fate, they are permanent house guests now.
__label__1 I just uploaded a new video showcasing my latest manga drawings and I think you all will really enjoy it! 🎨✨ I had a blast creating these characters and bringing them to life on the page. Your feedback on my last video was amazing, and it really motivates me to keep going!     In this video, I dive into my creative process, share some tips on character design, and even do a little speed drawing. I’d love to hear what you think, and if you have any suggestions for future videos or characters you'd like to see, let me know in the comments!     Thanks for all the support, and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it!     [Link to video]     Let’s keep the manga love going! ❤️
__label__1 I've been browsing Reddit for a while now, and I've noticed that there seems to be a significant number of autistic individuals participating in various subreddits, especially in communities like /r/autism. It got me thinking about why this platform attracts so many people on the spectrum.    For one, Reddit offers a level of anonymity that can be really appealing. Many autistic individuals might feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences online rather than in person, where social interactions can be overwhelming or anxiety-inducing. The ability to engage in discussions without the pressure of face-to-face communication can be a huge relief.    Additionally, Reddit is a place where people can find like-minded individuals. The autistic community on Reddit is incredibly supportive and understanding, which can be hard to find in real life. It’s a space where people can share their experiences, seek advice, and connect with others who truly understand what they’re going through.     I also think that the diversity of subreddits allows for a wide range of interests to be explored. Many autistic individuals have specific passions or hobbies, and Reddit provides a platform to dive deep into those interests, whether it’s gaming, art, science, or something else entirely.     Lastly, the wealth of information available on Reddit can be invaluable. From personal stories to research articles, users can educate themselves about autism and related topics, which can be empowering.     So, what do you all think? Why do you believe there’s such a large autistic userbase on Reddit? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently went through a breakup where I was the dumpee, and I’ve been reflecting on how my ex (the dumper) has been portraying me since we split. It feels like they’ve turned the narrative completely around, painting me as the villain in our story.     Throughout our relationship, I tried my best to be supportive and understanding, but now it seems like they’re telling mutual friends that I was the one who caused all the problems. I’ve heard from a few people that they’ve said I was too demanding or that I didn’t appreciate them enough. It’s really hurtful to hear this, especially since I thought we had a good understanding of each other.     I know that breakups can be messy and emotions run high, but is it common for dumpers to shift the blame onto the dumpee? It feels like a way to justify their decision to leave, but it’s also making it harder for me to heal. I’m trying to focus on moving forward, but the way they’re framing things is really affecting my self-esteem.     Has anyone else experienced this? How did you cope with being painted as the bad guy after a breakup?

__label__0     I am going in depression day after day. I don't know why, I don't know how. I just hate it, I hate myself now. It is bothering me so much. I have very few limited friends but I really don't know if I can share it with them. Or will they understand me, even a little.     Thankfully I have a very good boyfriend. Who is helping me fight this state of mind. But I dont know how long can he keep it together. My bad stage of life is effecting him as well. I just don't want to see him miserable because of me and I don't want to leave him either.     My classes are messing up, I am lacking behind, I am unable to focus, I don't know what to do. I am tired of faking it that it's all good. When it is not. I feel like I am burden on my boyfriend. To make it even worse, I am getting addicted to porn as it releases high Domaine which makes me feel good. But that is NOT HEALTHY at all.     Can someone talk to me, can you help me by just listening or letting me something good. i will be great full for each one of you!
__label__1 There have been discussions and rumors regarding Kim Yoo-jung's treatment at Sidus Entertainment, particularly during her early career. Some fans and netizens have expressed concerns about how she was managed, especially during her transition from a child actress to an adult star.     Many believe that the agency did not provide her with enough support or opportunities to showcase her talent fully, which led to her taking a break from acting for a while. However, it's important to note that these claims are largely based on speculation and personal opinions from fans rather than confirmed reports.     Kim Yoo-jung has since moved on to other projects and has been receiving a lot of love and support from her fans, which suggests that she is in a better place now. It’s always tough to hear about the struggles that our favorite stars go through, but it’s great to see them thriving despite the challenges.     What are your thoughts on this? Do you think agencies should do more to support their young talents?

__label__1 I've been eyeing the Digital Deluxe version of Sonic Frontiers, and I'm curious if it's really worth the extra cash. For those who have already played it, what do you think?     From what I've seen, the Digital Deluxe version includes some extra content like additional cosmetics, a few extra in-game items, and maybe some exclusive music tracks. But I'm wondering if these extras really enhance the gameplay experience or if they feel more like fluff.     For those who have played both versions, do you feel like the Digital Deluxe version added enough value to justify the price difference? Or would you recommend just sticking with the standard edition?     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__1 Android Development    Hello everyone,    I'm currently working on an Android app and I've noticed that the Toolbar does not have a shadow by default. I want to add a shadow effect to my Toolbar to give it a more elevated look.     Here’s the code I’m currently using for my Toolbar in XML:    ```xml  <androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar      android:id="@+id/toolbar"      android:layout_width="match_parent"      android:layout_height="wrap_content"      android:background="@color/colorPrimary"      app:popupTheme="@style/AppTheme.PopupOverlay" />  ```    I’ve tried adding elevation directly in the XML like this:    ```xml  android:elevation="4dp"  ```    But it doesn’t seem to work as expected. I also tried setting the elevation programmatically in my Activity:    ```java  Toolbar toolbar = findViewById(R.id.toolbar);  toolbar.setElevation(4f);  ```    However, the shadow still doesn’t appear.     Is there a specific way to enable shadows for the Toolbar, or do I need to use a different approach? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!    Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate my wife’s new husband on his recent book release! It’s a wild ride, but I’m really proud of him. I mean, who would have thought that after all those years of marriage, I’d be sharing my wife with a guy who writes books?     It’s a bit of a strange situation, but honestly, I think it’s great. He’s got this whole literary vibe going on, and I can’t help but feel a little inspired. I mean, I’ve never written a book, but maybe I should start?     Anyway, I’m just here trying to navigate this new dynamic. I guess I’ll have to get used to sharing the spotlight with my wife’s new husband. Who knows, maybe we’ll even collaborate on a book together someday!     But for now, cheers to him and his literary success! I hope he remembers to keep the fridge stocked with snacks for when I come over to visit.
__label__1 Hey Guardians,    So my birthday is coming up soon, and I've been thinking about how much I want to dive deeper into the Stasis subclass. I’ve been having a blast with my other subclasses, but I feel like Stasis could really add a new layer to my gameplay, especially in PvP.    I was jokingly asking my mom if I could get Stasis as a birthday gift, but it got me thinking—what are your thoughts on Stasis? Is it worth it? How does it compare to the other subclasses in terms of versatility and fun?     Also, if you have any tips for mastering Stasis, I’d love to hear them! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been playing a lot of unrated matches lately, and I've noticed something interesting. It seems like my solo queue games often have more strategic depth than my competitive matches.     In unrated, I find that players are more willing to experiment with different agents and strategies without the pressure of ranks on the line. People seem to communicate better, trying out unique team compositions and working together to execute plays. I’ve had games where we’ve coordinated ultimates and set up crossfires, and it felt like we were really working as a team.    On the other hand, in competitive matches, I often encounter players who are more focused on individual performance rather than team strategy. There’s a lot of pressure to win, which sometimes leads to players picking meta agents and playing for themselves instead of collaborating. I’ve seen people go rogue, trying to clutch rounds solo instead of playing for the team, which can be frustrating.    Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think the pressure of ranked play affects how players approach strategy in the game? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently purchased an iPhone with AppleCare+ in the US, but I'm planning to travel to Europe for an extended period. I was wondering if I can still use my AppleCare+ coverage for any repairs or service while I'm abroad.     I've heard mixed things about this, with some saying that AppleCare+ is only valid in the country of purchase, while others mention that it can be used internationally.     Has anyone had experience with this? Can I walk into an Apple Store in Europe and get service for my device covered by AppleCare+? Any insights or official information would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Today marks 40 days since I decided to stop drinking, and I just wanted to share my journey so far. It hasn’t been easy, but I can honestly say it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made for myself.     In the beginning, I was filled with doubt and fear. I worried about how I would cope in social situations, how I would handle stress, and whether I would miss the taste of my favorite drinks. But as the days went by, I started to notice some incredible changes.     My energy levels have skyrocketed! I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day instead of dragging myself out of bed with a hangover. I’ve also been sleeping better, which has made a huge difference in my mood and overall outlook on life.     I’ve found new hobbies to fill my time, like hiking and reading, and I’ve even started cooking more. It’s amazing how much time I have now that I’m not spending it drinking or recovering from drinking.     Social situations have been challenging, but I’ve learned to navigate them. I bring my own non-alcoholic drinks, and I’ve found that I can still have fun without alcohol. I’ve also discovered a supportive community of friends who respect my choice and encourage me to stay on this path.     I still have moments where I crave a drink, especially during stressful times, but I remind myself of all the reasons I chose to stop. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next.     Thank you to everyone in this community for your support and inspiration. IWNDWYT!
__label__1 I'm looking for some creative ideas for a physics investigatory project for my class. I want to explore something that is both interesting and feasible to conduct with the resources I have. Here are a few ideas I've thought of:    1. **The Effect of Temperature on the Resistance of a Wire**: Investigate how the resistance of different materials changes with temperature. This could involve heating a wire and measuring its resistance at various temperatures.    2. **Solar Oven Efficiency**: Build a simple solar oven using cardboard and aluminum foil, and test how different designs affect its ability to cook food or heat water. This could tie into discussions about renewable energy.    3. **Pendulum Motion**: Explore how the length of a pendulum affects its period. You could create a simple pendulum and measure the time it takes to complete a certain number of swings at different lengths.    4. **Magnetic Levitation**: Investigate how magnets can be used to levitate objects. You could create a simple setup using magnets and test how different configurations affect the stability of the levitation.    5. **The Physics of Sound**: Experiment with different materials to see how they affect sound absorption. You could create a soundproof box and test how well different materials (like foam, cardboard, etc.) reduce sound.    6. **Projectile Motion**: Create a simple catapult and measure the distance a projectile travels at different launch angles. This could lead to discussions about the physics of motion and angles.    7. **Water Rocket Launch**: Design and build a water rocket and investigate how the amount of water and air pressure affects the height it reaches.    If anyone has additional suggestions or has worked on similar projects, I would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with my controller settings in Monster Hunter Rise on PC. Every time I launch the game, it seems to reset my controller configuration, and I have to rebind my buttons each time. I use a DualShock 4, and while it works fine in other games, Rise just doesn't seem to hold onto my settings.    I've tried verifying the game files through Steam, and even reinstalled the game, but nothing seems to stick. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, did you find a solution?     Also, are there any specific settings or configurations that you recommend for using a controller with Rise? I want to make sure I'm getting the best experience possible without having to deal with constant resets. Thanks in advance for any help!
__label__1 It's interesting to think that communication has become so reliant on visual cues, especially lip reading. With masks covering our mouths, people are not just missing out on the words being spoken, but also the expressions and nuances that come with them. It's a reminder of how much we take for granted in our everyday interactions and how important non-verbal communication is in understanding each other.

I wore earplugs, but I guess they didn’t help much.     What do you guys do to protect your ears at concerts? Any tips for next time? Also, what’s the loudest concert you’ve ever been to?

__label__1 I was just re-listening to some of the older episodes and I can't help but remember the one where they discussed "A Cure for Wellness." It was such a wild ride! The way they broke down the film's bizarre plot and the visuals was hilarious. I mean, who thought a movie about a wellness center could be so creepy and surreal?     I loved how they pointed out the absurdity of the whole premise, especially the scenes with the eels. Like, what was up with that? It’s like they were trying to make a statement about health and wellness but ended up just making us all question our life choices.     Also, the cinematography was stunning, but the story was just all over the place. I remember one of them saying it felt like a fever dream, and honestly, that’s the best way to describe it.     Did anyone else find themselves laughing at the ridiculousness of it all? I’d love to hear your thoughts on that episode and the movie itself! What did you guys think of the ending? It left me with more questions than answers!

__label__1 I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I genuinely don’t care about the privacy of my data. I understand that data privacy is a hot topic, especially with all the news about breaches and companies misusing personal information. However, I feel like the convenience and benefits of sharing my data far outweigh the potential risks.    Every time I use an app or a service that requires my data, I get a more personalized experience. Whether it’s getting tailored recommendations on Netflix or having my favorite songs curated on Spotify, I appreciate the way these platforms use my data to enhance my experience. Plus, I’m not doing anything illegal or particularly sensitive, so I don’t see the harm in sharing my information.    I also think that the fear surrounding data privacy is often exaggerated. Most companies are more interested in using data to improve their services rather than exploiting individuals. I trust that the benefits of technology and connectivity are worth the trade-off.     In a world where everything is interconnected, I believe that being overly protective of our data can hinder innovation and progress. So, while I understand the concerns, I’m okay with my data being out there. It’s just part of living in the digital age.

__label__1 I wanted to give an update on the situation with our neighbor's kid that I posted about a few weeks ago. For context, this kid has been a real handful, constantly causing trouble in our yard and being disrespectful to my children. I was at my wit's end trying to figure out how to handle it without escalating things further.    After some thought, I decided to approach the parents directly. I was nervous about it, but I felt it was necessary to address the behavior. I knocked on their door and explained the situation calmly, sharing specific examples of what had been happening. To my surprise, they were very receptive and seemed genuinely unaware of their child's actions. They apologized and promised to have a talk with him about respecting boundaries and playing nicely.    Since then, things have improved significantly! The kid has been much more respectful when he comes over, and I’ve even seen him playing more cooperatively with my kids. It’s such a relief to see them all getting along better. I think having that open line of communication made a huge difference.    I just wanted to share this update in case anyone else is dealing with a similar situation. Sometimes, a direct conversation can lead to positive changes. Thanks for all the advice and support from this community!
__label__0 I'd argue if you gave every Celtic fan truth serum they'd kind of admit that Kyrie is fun to hate. He's a worthy opponent when he actually decides to play. He has 0 self awareness. He exacerbates the rivalry intentionally and unintentionally.     Draymond just sucks to watch he makes the game like a rock fight in a mud pit. And for some reasons officials defer to him.

__label__1 I recently decided to customize my keyboard and went for a Jett theme to match my favorite Valorant agent! 🎨✈️ I painted the keycaps in her signature colors: a mix of blue, white, and a touch of purple. I also added some subtle cloud designs to mimic her abilities.     It was a fun project, and I think it turned out pretty well! I love how it adds a personal touch to my gaming setup.     Here are some pictures of the process and the final result! Let me know what you think or if you have any tips for future projects!     [Insert images here]      Also, if anyone else has done similar customizations, I’d love to see your work!
__label__1 I've been getting into manga recently and I'm curious about how everyone else reads it. Do you prefer physical copies or digital versions?     For me, I started with digital because it’s more convenient and I can access a wider range of titles without having to hunt down physical copies. I use a couple of apps that have a good selection, but I sometimes miss the feel of holding a book in my hands.     I’ve also noticed that some people really enjoy collecting physical volumes and displaying them on their shelves. It seems like a great way to support the creators and have a tangible piece of the story.     What about you all? Do you have any recommendations for where to read or buy manga? And do you think one format is better than the other? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

__label__1 I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about my dating preferences and I’ve come to a realization that’s been weighing heavily on my mind. I don’t want to date within my race anymore.     Growing up, I was always told that I should stick to my own kind, that it would be easier to relate to someone who shares the same cultural background and experiences. But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that love and connection can transcend those boundaries.     I’ve met so many amazing people from different races and backgrounds who have opened my eyes to new perspectives and experiences. I find myself drawn to their stories, their cultures, and the way they see the world. It’s refreshing and exciting, and I can’t help but feel that limiting myself to just one race is doing a disservice to my own happiness.     I know this might not be a popular opinion, and I’m sure some people will have their judgments, but I’m tired of feeling confined by societal expectations. I want to explore love in all its forms, without the constraints of race. I want to embrace the beauty of diversity and find someone who truly resonates with me, regardless of their background.     I just needed to get this off my chest. It feels liberating to acknowledge this shift in my mindset, and I hope that others can find the courage to break free from the norms that don’t serve them. Here’s to new beginnings and the endless possibilities that love can bring.
__label__0 I just thought I would share this in case it might help someone else.     My pmdd has gotten so severe the last year (depression, suicidal ideation, rage, etc. about a week before my period) and I’ve tried everything and nothing has helped. But this month I managed to have barely any symptoms, just a bit weepy some days, I’ll take that over laying bed depressed for a week! I’m cautiously optimistic because my pmdd was getting unbearable, so I thought I would share what I did differently this month in case it can provide some relief to anyone else.    - the main thing is red raspberry leaf tea. I drink it every night and really think this is the main game changer. I’m using the Yogi brand, you can find it at Walmart.     -probiotics and yogurt. This sounds weird but there’s a lot of research on receptors in the brain being linked to your stomach, and I definitely notice I have upset stomachs a lot during my hell week. I eat a yogurt everyday for the good bacteria and add seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, flax).     -cutting out dairy, less meat and eggs. You might be confused from the one above but I eat almond milk yogurt, they have all different kinds (oat, soy, etc.). Lara Briden talks about this, I guess it’s something to do with the hormones in lactating cows. I also cut down on my meat/egg consumption a lot, but no completely, since they often use artificial hormones to promote growth and production.     I know everyone’s different and just because it helped me doesn’t mean it will help you, but finding any relief is amazing.     For context, I’ve tried birth control, antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, supplements, lifestyle changes (exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc.)antihistamines, progesterone cream and nothing has worked, my pmdd kept getting worse, so currently the above is the only things I’m doing for relief.     I was considering surgery. Still might if this relief doesn’t last, I’ll post an update in a few months.
__label__1 I've been stuck in Gold 3 for a while now and I'm really eager to climb to Platinum. I feel like I have a decent understanding of the game, but I know there are areas I can improve on. Here are a few things I've been focusing on:    1. **Map Awareness**: I try to keep an eye on the minimap, but I often find myself missing opportunities to help my teammates or avoid ganks. What are some effective ways to improve my map awareness?    2. **Wave Management**: I understand the basics of freezing and slow pushing, but I struggle to execute it consistently. How can I practice this in my games? Are there specific champions or situations where I should focus on this more?    3. **Champion Pool**: I currently play a mix of champions, but I feel like I might be spreading myself too thin. Should I focus on mastering a few champions instead? If so, how do I choose which ones to stick with?    4. **Decision Making**: Sometimes I hesitate during crucial moments, like whether to engage in a fight or back off. How can I improve my decision-making skills in-game?    5. **Communication**: I try to communicate with my team, but I often feel like my pings and messages go unnoticed. What are some effective ways to communicate without being toxic or annoying?    Any advice or tips on these areas would be greatly appreciated! I'm really looking to improve and make that jump to Platinum.

__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of discussions about the upcoming MW2 open beta, and I'm curious if anyone knows if you can access it without having to preorder the game. I know some betas require a preorder to get in early, but I've heard that this one might be different.     If anyone has any info or past experiences with betas in the COD franchise, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Can we expect to jump in without a preorder, or is that just wishful thinking?
__label__1 Cats have a unique charm that draws many people to them. For starters, their independent nature is refreshing; they don’t require constant attention like some other pets. You can leave them alone for a few hours, and they’ll be just fine, which is perfect for those of us with busy lives.    Their personalities are incredibly diverse. Some are playful and energetic, while others are calm and cuddly. It’s like having a little furry roommate with their own quirks and habits. Plus, the way they purr when they’re content is one of the most soothing sounds in the world.     Cats also have a certain elegance and grace that’s mesmerizing to watch. Whether they’re stalking a toy or simply lounging in a sunbeam, there’s something captivating about their movements. And let’s not forget their playful antics! Watching a cat chase after a laser pointer or pounce on a feather toy can bring endless joy and laughter.    Additionally, many cat lovers appreciate the companionship they provide. Cats can be incredibly affectionate, often forming strong bonds with their owners. They may not always show it in the same way dogs do, but when a cat curls up on your lap or nudges you for attention, it feels special.    Lastly, there’s a certain comfort in having a cat around. They can be great stress relievers, and their presence can make a home feel warmer and more inviting. Overall, loving cats is about appreciating their unique personalities, the joy they bring, and the companionship they offer.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 20-year-old single white girl looking to meet new people and have some fun.

__label__1 My friends and I recently found an old, weathered piece of paper while cleaning out my grandmother's attic. The paper is covered in what looks like a mix of handwritten notes and some sort of code or cipher. We can make out a few words here and there, but the majority of it is completely illegible or seems to be in a language we don't recognize.     We’re curious if anyone has experience with deciphering old texts or codes. The paper has some strange symbols and drawings alongside the text, which might be clues. We’ve tried searching online for similar symbols but haven’t had much luck.     If anyone has any tips on how to approach deciphering this or if you can help us figure out what it says, we would really appreciate it! We can share images of the paper if that would help. Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Does anyone have any thoughts on what this pull could mean in regards to someone’s feelings about me?  The Queen of Swords is throwing me off a bit here!  What I’m taking notice of here is the Two of Wands and The World are both facing the Queen of Swords. I also noticed that in the Two of Wands the man is holding the world in his hands, and then right after I pulled The World card. Which I think def can’t be a coincidence!   I feel like the pull here is overall positive. But for some reason I can’t pinpoint exactly what it might mean. I’m thinking this person might feel indecisive about something regarding me here (something more physical than emotional). But their feelings about me are pretty solid, and they feel really positive about me. With the man holding the world in his hands, and then me pulling The World card in thinking maybe that’s how they view me. Like their world revolves around me rn, I’m their main focus, idk lol!   If anyone has any more insight I’d be so appreciative!    Deck: Rider Waite   Artist: Pamela Colman Smith
__label__1 I just had to share this adorable moment with you all! My dog, Max, has been waiting all day for me to come home from work. As soon as I walked through the door, he couldn't contain his excitement! He started jumping up and down, wagging his tail so hard I thought he might take off!     He ran in circles around me, barking happily and bringing me his favorite toy, a squeaky bone. It was like he was saying, "Finally! You're home! Let's play!"     I couldn't help but laugh and give him all the belly rubs he wanted. It's moments like these that remind me how much joy our furry friends bring into our lives. I hope this brings a smile to your face just like it did for me! 🐾❤️

__label__0 So, I'm getting a notebook after a looong time using a chromebook. It's mainly for work but I do want to play my old Harry Potter game collection, and I remember I had problem running the first three games because apparently it needed something (sorry, I don't know much about PC's) that only older systems had.     So, I'm after a model with 8GB RAM, Intel I5 + Geforce MX110 (2GB).     Will I necessarily need to run a virtual machine (Windows XP) or something to play the older games? If so, can those specs handle it?

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm currently planning my course load for next year and I'm a bit torn about how many AP classes to take versus honors classes. I know that AP classes are weighted more heavily in GPA calculations and can look great on college applications, but I also want to make sure I'm not overwhelming myself.     I’m considering taking 3 honors classes and only 1 AP class. Is this a good balance? Will colleges look down on me for not taking more APs, or is it more important to have a strong GPA and perform well in my classes? Any advice or experiences you can share would be really helpful!
__label__1 I was browsing through some forums and came across a thread where someone referred to DCS as a "religion". At first, I chuckled, but then I started to think about it more deeply.     In many ways, DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) does have some cult-like qualities. The dedication of its community is impressive, with countless hours spent mastering aircraft systems, flight dynamics, and combat tactics. You have the die-hard fans who will defend the realism of the sim to the death, often engaging in heated debates about the accuracy of flight models or the best way to employ a certain weapon system.     Then there are the rituals: the pre-flight checks, the briefing sessions, and the post-mission debriefs that mirror real-life military procedures. And let’s not forget the almost religious reverence for the developers and the constant hope for new modules and updates, akin to waiting for a divine revelation.     But what really struck me is how DCS fosters a sense of community. Just like a congregation, players come together to share knowledge, tips, and experiences. Whether it’s through multiplayer sessions, Discord servers, or YouTube channels, there’s a strong sense of belonging among DCS enthusiasts.     So, is DCS a religion? Maybe not in the traditional sense, but it certainly has its own culture, beliefs, and community dynamics that resemble one. What do you all think? Are we just a bunch of flight sim nerds, or is there something more profound at play here?

__label__1 Ruth Bader Ginsburg was such a monumental figure in American history, and her passing feels like a significant loss not just for the Supreme Court, but for the entire country. For me, it symbolizes the end of an era of fierce advocacy for gender equality and civil rights. RBG was a trailblazer who fought tirelessly for the rights of women and marginalized groups, and her legacy will continue to inspire future generations.    Her passing also raises concerns about the future of the Supreme Court and the potential shifts in legal precedents that could affect women's rights, healthcare, and social justice. It makes me reflect on the importance of continuing her work and fighting for the values she stood for.     On a personal level, I feel a mix of sadness and motivation. Sadness for the loss of such a powerful voice, but motivation to carry on her fight for equality and justice. I think it’s crucial for us to honor her legacy by staying engaged in political and social issues, advocating for change, and supporting leaders who align with her vision.     What does her passing mean for you? How do you think we can best honor her legacy?
__label__1 I recently did a bed and ISA transaction, and I’m trying to understand how it affects my Capital Gains Tax (CGT) allowance. For those who might not be familiar, bed and ISA is a strategy where you sell shares outside of an ISA and then immediately repurchase them within an ISA to shield future gains from CGT.    My question is, after executing a bed and ISA, do I still retain my annual CGT allowance for the tax year? I know that the gains from the shares sold will be subject to CGT, but what about the allowance itself?     For example, if I sold shares that resulted in a gain of £10,000 and my CGT allowance is £12,300 for the year, would I still have the full allowance available for any other potential gains I might have later in the year? Or does the gain from the bed and ISA transaction reduce my allowance?    Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I've been working closely with a younger guy (9 yrs younger than me) I hired for our company for the last two years. I've felt an energy there, but he's very respectful as I'm married (context...it's an open one, but he doesn't know this. I'm strictly business with him). He's recently out of a marriage and now dating a woman ten years younger than him. Here's the things I am picking up...   - he deliberately makes time for our meetings, and will move his schedule if needed - always prefers face to face if we can  - always compliments my work, my style, my art/interests and successes  - Always pays for business lunches even when I invite  - Never talks about his girlfriend - but will with my other staff   - Gives me small thoughtful gifts like a book he thought I'd like  - shows a real care for my goals and team like a partner (not a vendor) goes above and beyond   I'm kind of attracted to him (he's very fit and stylish), but I have a rule about dipping into the company ink. However, I feel these vibes and don't know if he's being just a really nice guy or if I am denying my intuition. I'm also horny as fuck most of the time and this could be my imagination :) I'd love your opinions.   Would you break the rule?

__label__1 I just had the most unbelievable experience in class today, and I need to vent!     So, I was teaching a lesson on the importance of kindness and empathy, and I thought it was going really well. The kids were engaged, and we even had a great discussion about how to treat each other with respect. But then, out of nowhere, one of my students raised their hand and said, "But what if someone is just really annoying? Can we be mean to them?"     I was taken aback! I mean, I get that kids can be brutally honest, but I was not expecting that kind of question after such a heartfelt discussion. I tried to steer the conversation back to kindness, but it felt like I was losing them.     Then, another student chimed in with, "Yeah, like what if they just keep talking during the lesson?" I couldn't help but laugh a little because, well, it was true! But I also realized that I needed to address this behavior in a constructive way.     I ended up turning it into a teachable moment about how we can express our frustrations without being mean and how to communicate effectively with each other. But seriously, are you kidding me? Sometimes I feel like I’m trying to teach them about the world, and they’re just trying to figure out how to navigate their own little social jungle!     Has anyone else had a moment like this? How do you handle unexpected comments from students that throw you off your game?

__label__1 I need some advice on how to handle a small but persistent issue in my marriage. My husband has a habit of leaving his dirty shoes on the dining chairs and other furniture around the house. I’ve mentioned it to him a few times, but it seems to slip his mind.     I understand that we all have our quirks, and I don’t want to come off as nagging, but it bothers me because I feel like it’s unsanitary and it makes the house look messy. I’ve tried to gently remind him, but I’m not sure if I’m approaching it the right way.     How do you all handle similar situations? Should I be more direct, or is there a way to make it a light-hearted conversation? I want to maintain a positive atmosphere in our home without letting this small issue become a source of tension. Any tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I recently came across the proposal to replace Columbus Day with a holiday honoring Florence Scala, a prominent figure in Chicago's history. For those who may not know, Florence Scala was a pioneering Italian-American activist who fought for workers' rights and played a significant role in the labor movement during the early 20th century.     I think this is a fantastic idea! Not only does it recognize the contributions of Italian-Americans to our city, but it also shifts the focus from a controversial historical figure to someone who truly fought for social justice and equality.     What do you all think? Do you support this change? How do you feel about the impact of such a holiday on our community? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 Hey everyone! Just received my pair of 310Y Mars Yard 2.0 and I wanted to get your thoughts on the quality.

__label__1 Hi everyone,    I’m curious about the costs associated with owning a car in the Greater Toronto Area. With the rising gas prices, insurance rates, and maintenance fees, I’m trying to get a better understanding of how much people typically spend on their vehicles each year.    Could you share your yearly expenses, including:  - Fuel costs  - Insurance premiums  - Maintenance and repairs  - Parking fees (if applicable)  - Any other costs you might incur (like tolls or car washes)    I’m looking for a rough estimate to help me budget better, so any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__0 I'm very proud of myself today. I'm 3 months sober from cocaine and today was my second day back at school. School for me has always been hell, I'm constantly burnt out, excruciatingly miserable and bored and the only thing that just barely got me through it last year was drugs, specifically cocaine. It helped me survive until it ultimately was part of the reason I no longer wanted to, and as addiction goes, everything quickly turned around until I was forced to stop myself or die. It was easily one of the hardest things I had ever done, but I must say it was worth it. Being back at school has brought all of those feelings back as if they were thawing there until I returned, just to consume me all over again. I did trips around my head going back and forth on whether or not I should do cocaine once more just to get through the next couple of days. After a deep think, I realised that it was the addiction talking, it was trying to suck me in again and I was the only thing that could stop myself from going back. If I did it once more and cut the streak, how many more 'once mores' would I allow? I didn't want to know the answer. I have 2 more years left of high school education and cocaine is the last thing that will get me through it. I cannot repeat the same mistake twice. These past few years have been very traumatic for me and cocaine has this special way of distancing you from them to the point that it feels like they barely exist.     My dealer said he had a kilo of 999 heroin on him. Heroin has always been something so mysterious to me, something I've craved to do for so long. I had done it before, but not by itself. It was mixed in with a batch of cocaine I'd bought a while back and honestly I must say it was that batch that I genuinely believe had ruined my life forever. I felt I needed something, just something to take the edge off of school and cocaine was something I just would not let myself do...heroin was the next best thing, I just had to have it. So I called my dealer and told him to sell me a gram. He agreed and we'd made arrangements, he was to be here within the next hour. I planned out my affair with the gram I was about to purchase and it was the perfect escape in my head. I was desperate. The second I got off the phone, I froze and said "No" out loud. I suppose you could say it was my inner-monologue or intuition vocally begging me not to let life slip away again. I tried hard to ignore it and go through with the plan, but then I remembered everything that I'd done as a result of ignoring myself. Reluctantly, I called him back with an excuse and told him I couldn't go through with it. I hung up the phone and found myself crying, it was so hard, unimaginably hard but I did it. I'm so proud of myself that I did but part of me is filled with regret. I still want it so badly but I won't let myself. Sorry for my lengthiness, I just had to tell someone who understands or put it out there somewhere, it's so hard.
__label__1 Paradox psychosis is a fascinating concept that has been touched upon in *The Umbrella Academy*, especially with the time travel elements and the consequences of altering timelines. I wanted to dive into how this phenomenon might affect our favorite characters and their mental states.    **Five**: As the most experienced time traveler, Five has faced the consequences of his actions more than anyone else. His time in the apocalyptic future and the subsequent jumps back to the present have likely contributed to a form of paradox psychosis. He’s seen the end of the world and the death of his family, which must weigh heavily on his psyche. The pressure of trying to fix timelines while dealing with the trauma of his past could lead to a fragmented sense of self, making him question what is real and what is a result of his time travel.    **Klaus**: Klaus’s ability to communicate with the dead already puts him in a unique mental space, but add in the complications of time travel and paradoxes, and it’s a recipe for chaos. He often struggles with his own reality, and the idea of paradox psychosis could amplify his existing issues with substance abuse and denial. If he were to encounter alternate versions of himself or his siblings, it could lead to a deeper existential crisis.    **Vanya/Viktor**: After discovering their powers and the truth about their past, Viktor has had to grapple with their identity and the implications of their abilities. If they were to experience paradox psychosis, it could manifest as a struggle between their past self and the person they are trying to become. The fear of becoming a destructive force again could lead to a split in their personality, where they might question their intentions and actions.    **Allison**: Allison’s journey has been heavily influenced by her powers and the choices she’s made. If she were to experience paradox psychosis, it could stem from the guilt of using her powers on her loved ones and the consequences of those actions. The idea of alternate realities where she made different choices could haunt her, leading to a fractured sense of self and a struggle to reconcile her past with her present.    **Diego**: Diego’s desire to be a hero and his relationship with his siblings could be complicated by paradox psychosis. If he were to encounter alternate versions of himself who made different choices, it could lead to feelings of inadequacy and confusion about his own identity. The pressure to live up to the expectations of being a hero while dealing with the consequences of time travel could push him to the brink.    **Ben**: As a ghost, Ben already exists in a liminal space, but if he were to experience paradox psychosis, it could manifest as a struggle between his past life and his current existence. The idea of being trapped between timelines and unable to influence the outcomes could lead to a deep sense of frustration and despair.    Overall, the concept of paradox psychosis adds another layer of complexity to the characters in *The Umbrella Academy*. It raises questions about identity, reality, and the consequences of their actions across time. How do you think each character would cope with the psychological effects of their time-traveling adventures? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been trying to fully remap my hotkeys in Age of Empires IV, especially for buildings like the Council Hall and King's Palace, but it seems like some of the hotkeys just won't take effect. I can change most of them without any issues, but these specific buildings always revert back to their default settings.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a workaround or a specific setting I might be missing? I really want to customize my controls to fit my playstyle better, and it's frustrating that these key bindings aren't sticking. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been thinking about the potential for Ironback Boars to be added to the Greenskins roster in a future Lord Pack. These massive, armored boars would not only fit the aesthetic of the Greenskins but also provide a unique unit that could add some interesting dynamics to their playstyle.    Imagine a unit that could serve as a heavy cavalry option, charging into enemy lines with high armor and decent speed, disrupting formations and causing chaos. They could also have a special ability that allows them to trample through infantry, dealing damage and knocking them aside, similar to how the War Boar units operate but with a more armored twist.    Additionally, Ironback Boars could be tied to a new legendary lord or hero, perhaps a more beastly character who specializes in beast units and has unique mechanics that enhance their effectiveness on the battlefield. This could open up new strategies for Greenskin players, focusing on a more beast-centric army composition.    What do you all think? Would Ironback Boars be a welcome addition to the Greenskin roster? What kind of abilities or mechanics would you like to see with them?
__label__1 I’m selling my Holosun HS510c red dot sight along with the HM3X magnifier for a total of $385. Both items are in excellent condition and have been well taken care of. The HS510c has a clear sight picture and features a solar panel for extended battery life, while the HM3X magnifier provides a great boost in range without sacrificing too much weight.    I’ve used them on my AR for a few range days, but I’m switching up my setup and no longer need them.     Price includes shipping within the continental US. Payment via PayPal (FF) or Zelle preferred.     Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want more pictures!     Thanks for looking!
__label__0 I posted on here a few weeks ago about being burnt out as an NAIA freshman and got some great responses so I thought I would share something else. So to those who didn’t see my last post, I suffered a stress fracture back in January just 2 days after my first indoor meet. I cross trained like crazy, lost 7 pounds, and actually was in halfway decent shape. I attempted to come back to running and did a workout in mid February that just killed me. And injured me even more. Although I was in a walking boot at this point, my coach still decided to take me to indoor nationals with the team. I’m glad I got to go, but people on the trip sort of treated me as if I didn’t deserve to be there. During that trip, I found out that many of the other freshman were extremely pissed off at me for going to nationals because they wanted to go. We have 22 guys on our team and only 8 get to travel to nationals for cross country. I was our 8th guy last year, and all anyone can talk about it being in the top 8. I just know that it I go to nats again they’ll be really upset. At this point I’m considering not even going to nats even if I’m scoring points for our team. Is there any advice on how to deal with this?
__label__1 I try to be happy for you. I really do. I see you thriving, moving on, and it feels like a punch to the gut every time I catch a glimpse of your new life. I want to cheer you on, to celebrate your victories, but instead, I find myself grappling with a mix of emotions that I can’t quite untangle.    You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I hope you find it. I hope you wake up every day with a smile, knowing that you are loved and cherished. I want to be the person who can genuinely say, "I’m so proud of you!" without feeling the weight of my own heartache.    But it’s hard. It’s hard to watch you move forward while I feel stuck in the past, replaying our memories like a broken record. I remember the laughter, the late-night talks, the dreams we shared. I remember how we thought we could conquer the world together. And now, it feels like I’m just a spectator in your life, watching from the sidelines as you build a future without me.    I try to be happy for you, but sometimes it feels like I’m just pretending. I put on a brave face, I smile, I nod, but inside, I’m still processing the loss of what we had. I wish I could let go of the hurt and embrace the joy of your success, but it’s a journey I’m still navigating.    So, here’s to you. I hope you find everything you’re looking for. I hope you find love, laughter, and all the beautiful things life has to offer. And maybe one day, I’ll be able to look back and feel nothing but happiness for you, too.
__label__1 I'm currently a sophomore in college and I've been struggling with my GPA this semester. I started off strong, but a combination of personal issues and a heavy course load has really taken a toll on my grades. I'm worried about how this will affect my future, especially when it comes to applying for internships and graduate schools.    I wanted to ask if anyone has tips on how to improve my GPA moving forward. Are there specific strategies or resources that have worked for you? Also, how much do you think a single bad semester can impact my overall GPA and future opportunities?     Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I'm 19 and was diagnosed with PCOS recently, so I was told to start the pill and come back in 6 months from now to see if there were improvements in my ovaries. The one which was prescribed to me is 3mg/0,02mg. I'm scared to take it because the chances of getting serious side effects such as blood clots and strokes freak me out. If the chances were 1 in 100.000 or even 1 in 10.000 I wouldn't be worrying so much, but the pamphlet from the pill I was prescribed says that 1 in 1000 women get these issues. 1 in 1000 does not sound like a low chance to me! I know millions and millions of women take the pill but reading all these serious side effects that could arise freaks me out so much. Reading all these terrible stories on the Internet isn't helping. Should I be feeling this scared? Is the risk worth it?
__label__1 I don’t know what it is, but there’s just something about girls with muscular thighs that drives me absolutely wild. 😩 Like, I can’t help but admire the strength and confidence that comes with it. Whether they’re into sports, fitness, or just have that natural athletic build, it’s seriously attractive.     I mean, have you seen those girls who can squat like a beast or run for miles? It’s not just about the looks; it’s the dedication and hard work they put into their fitness that makes them even more appealing. Plus, muscular thighs just look so powerful and strong!     I’ve been trying to get into fitness myself, and I can only hope to achieve that kind of strength one day. Anyone else feel the same way? What do you think about girls with muscular thighs? Let’s talk about it!
__label__1 As we eagerly await the announcement of the next Pokémon region, speculation is running wild about its theme and name. One intriguing theory suggests that the Gen 9 region will be named after light, and there are several reasons why this could be the case.    Firstly, the Pokémon franchise has a history of naming regions after natural elements or concepts. For instance, the Galar region is inspired by the UK, while Alola draws from Hawaiian culture. A region themed around light could symbolize hope, positivity, and new beginnings, which aligns perfectly with the overarching themes of many Pokémon games.    Additionally, light has been a recurring motif in Pokémon lore. Legendary Pokémon like Solgaleo and Xerneas embody the concept of light and life, suggesting that the next generation could explore these themes further. Imagine a region where light plays a crucial role in the environment, perhaps with unique mechanics involving day and night cycles or special light-based moves that could change the dynamics of battles.    Moreover, the visual aesthetics of a light-themed region could be stunning. Think of vibrant landscapes illuminated by dazzling sunlight, bioluminescent Pokémon, and cities that glow at night. This could provide a fresh and captivating experience for players, making exploration feel magical and immersive.    Finally, with the advancements in graphics and gameplay mechanics, a light-themed region could introduce innovative features, such as puzzles that require manipulating light or shadow to progress. This would not only enhance the gameplay but also deepen the connection between the player and the environment.    In conclusion, naming the Gen 9 region after light could open up a world of possibilities for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and visual design. It would be a fitting tribute to the enduring themes of the Pokémon series while also providing a fresh and exciting experience for both new and veteran players.

__label__1 Beatrix is a versatile marksman with a unique playstyle that can be quite rewarding once mastered. Here are some tips to help you improve your gameplay with her:    1. **Understand Her Skills**: Beatrix has four different weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Spend time in practice mode to get a feel for each weapon's range, damage, and mechanics. Knowing when to switch weapons can turn the tide of battle.    2. **Positioning is Key**: As a marksman, positioning is crucial. Always try to stay at the backline during team fights. Use your mobility to dodge skill shots and reposition yourself to deal damage safely.    3. **Farm Efficiently**: Beatrix scales well with items, so make sure to farm minions and jungle camps effectively. Prioritize last-hitting to maximize your gold income, and don’t be afraid to rotate to help your teammates secure kills or objectives.    4. **Map Awareness**: Keep an eye on the minimap. Beatrix can be a target for assassins due to her squishiness. Always be aware of enemy positions and avoid overextending without vision.    5. **Itemization**: Build items that complement your playstyle and the game situation. Items like Berserker's Fury and Blade of Despair are great for increasing your damage output. Adapt your build based on the enemy team composition.    6. **Practice Your Aim**: Beatrix's skills require good aim, especially her sniper mode. Spend time practicing your aim in custom games or against bots to improve your accuracy.    7. **Communicate with Your Team**: Use pings and chat to communicate with your team. Let them know when you’re ready to engage or if you need assistance. Teamwork is essential in Mobile Legends.    8. **Watch Replays and Guides**: Check out gameplay videos or streams of high-level Beatrix players. Observing their decision-making and positioning can provide valuable insights.    9. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**: In intense situations, it’s easy to panic. Try to stay calm and focus on your mechanics. Remember, practice makes perfect!    10. **Have Fun**: Lastly, enjoy the game! The more you play and experiment with Beatrix, the better you’ll become. Don’t be afraid to try new strategies and learn from your mistakes.    Good luck, and may your shots always hit their mark!
__label__1 After the recent match where Rahul Tewatia had a tough outing, I think it's time we address the elephant in the room. Tewatia, who has been a fan favorite for his explosive performances in the IPL, faced a lot of criticism for his performance in the last game.     He took to social media to express his feelings and apologize to the fans for not living up to expectations. In his post, he mentioned how much he values the support from the fans and how he is working hard to improve his game.     It's important to remember that every player has off days, and the pressure of performing at the highest level can be immense. Tewatia has shown his potential in the past, and I believe he will bounce back stronger.     Let's show him some love and support in this thread! What are your thoughts on Tewatia's performance? Do you think he can turn it around in the upcoming matches? Share your views!

I want to be able to access my PC from another location, but every time I try to connect, I get an error message saying that the remote desktop can't connect to the computer.

__label__1 I don’t even know where to start. My family has always had a way of making me feel like I’m the black sheep, but today it hit a new low. We were all sitting around the dinner table, and out of nowhere, my uncle said I was a curse on the family. He said that everything bad that happens is somehow my fault, and that I bring negativity wherever I go.     I was just sitting there, stunned. I’ve always tried to be supportive and helpful, but it feels like no matter what I do, I can’t escape this label they’ve put on me. I’ve struggled with my mental health for years, and I thought they understood that. Instead, they just see me as a burden.     It hurts so much to hear that from the people who are supposed to love you unconditionally. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, trying to avoid conflict, but it never seems to be enough. I don’t know how to change their perception of me, and honestly, I’m starting to believe it myself.     I just want to be accepted and loved for who I am, but instead, I feel like I’m just a mistake. I don’t know how to cope with this feeling of being a curse. It’s suffocating, and I don’t know how to break free from it.
__label__1 I’ve been trying to avoid all spoilers for the upcoming God of War game, but I stumbled upon some gameplay leaks that have been circulating online. I’m curious if anyone else has seen these and if they think they might be legitimate spoilers or just fan-made content.     From what I gathered, the leaks show some intense combat sequences and possible new mechanics that could change the way we play. There are also hints at new characters and locations that could tie into the Norse mythology we’ve been exploring.     I’m torn because I want to stay in the dark and experience everything fresh when the game drops, but I also can’t help but be intrigued by what’s out there. For those who have seen the leaks, do you think they reveal too much? Or are they just teasers that leave a lot to the imagination?     Let’s discuss! And for those who haven’t seen anything, how are you managing to stay spoiler-free? Any tips would be appreciated!
__label__1 I’m heartbroken to share that one of my guinea pigs passed away unexpectedly. I have two pigs, and now I’m worried about the one that’s left. They were always together, and I can’t help but think about how lonely my surviving piggy must feel.     I’m looking for advice on how to help my remaining pig cope with the loss. Should I consider getting another companion for her? I’ve heard mixed opinions about introducing a new pig after losing one.     Also, how can I tell if she’s grieving? She seems a bit quieter than usual, but I’m not sure if that’s just her personality or if she’s affected by the loss.     Any tips on how to support her during this time would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I've been diving deeper into my home lab setup and I've been wondering about the "cutoff" date for older hardware. Specifically, when do you all think it's time to retire older servers, switches, or other components?     For context, I have a mix of hardware ranging from a few years old to some that are pushing a decade. I still have a couple of Dell PowerEdge R710s that I use for virtualization, and while they still run fine, I’m starting to question their efficiency and reliability compared to newer models.     I know that performance is one factor, but what about support for newer technologies, power consumption, and security updates? At what point do you decide that the cost of keeping older hardware running outweighs the benefits?     I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Do you have a specific age or performance metric that you use to determine when to upgrade or retire hardware? Any advice on how to approach this decision would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I recently watched a YouTube video that featured a song I can't seem to identify. The video had a really vibrant and colorful aesthetic, with a lot of fast-paced editing. I remember there were scenes of people dancing in a club and some outdoor festival shots. The music had a catchy beat, and I think it was a mix of pop and electronic elements.     One part of the song had a female vocalist singing something that sounded like "we can dance all night" or something similar. I can't recall the exact lyrics, but it was super upbeat and made me want to move.     If anyone has any idea what this song might be, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!

__label__1 I've been reflecting on the concept of repentance and I'm a bit confused about what it truly means. Is repentance primarily an action, a thought, or perhaps a combination of both? I understand that it involves turning away from sin and seeking forgiveness, but I often wonder if I have truly repented in the right way.    Sometimes I feel like I might not have done it properly. I worry that my understanding of repentance might be too shallow or that I haven't fully grasped the weight of my sins. How do we know if we have genuinely repented? Is there a specific way we should approach it, or is it more about the sincerity of our hearts?    I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Thank you for taking the time to read my post!

__label__1 So, I (25M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about a year now. Overall, our relationship has been great, and we have a lot of fun together. However, something happened recently that has really hurt my feelings and made me question things.    During a private moment, we were joking around, and I made a comment about my size, trying to be light-hearted about it. Instead of being supportive or reassuring, she laughed and made a joke about it, saying something like, "Well, I guess size does matter!" I know she didn’t mean to hurt me, but it stung.     I’ve always been a bit self-conscious about my size, and her reaction made me feel embarrassed and inadequate. I tried to brush it off at the moment, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like it’s affected my confidence, both in and out of the bedroom.     I want to talk to her about how her comment made me feel, but I’m worried it might lead to an awkward conversation or make her feel bad. I don’t want to come off as overly sensitive, but I also don’t want to ignore how I feel.     How should I approach this conversation? Should I bring it up directly, or is there a better way to handle it? I really care about her, and I want to make sure we can communicate openly about things like this.

__label__1 Is it just me, or has this sub become a bit too serious lately? I mean, I get that we need moderation, but when I see posts about gym farts or waffles getting removed while actual British problems are being overlooked, it makes me wonder what the point is.     I used to love scrolling through the funny, relatable content that made me chuckle about our quirks as Brits, but now it feels like a chore. I miss the days when we could share a laugh over the little things that annoy us, like the weather or the tube being late.     Has anyone else noticed this shift? Are we all just supposed to be miserable about our problems without the light-hearted banter? I hope the new mods can find a balance because right now, it feels like we’re losing the fun of what this sub was all about.
__label__1 I came across a heartwarming story that really got me thinking about the way we attribute life-saving events to divine intervention rather than human action. A young boy reportedly saved his grandfather from choking by performing the Heimlich maneuver, and the family was quick to credit this miraculous event to their "sky daddy"—essentially attributing the boy's quick thinking and learned skills to a higher power.    While I can appreciate the sentiment of gratitude, it frustrates me that we often overlook the importance of education, training, and the boy's own instincts in such situations. The Heimlich maneuver is a learned skill, and the boy's ability to save his grandfather was a direct result of knowledge and practice, not divine intervention.     This kind of narrative perpetuates the idea that we should rely on faith rather than our own abilities and the resources available to us. It diminishes the value of human agency and the importance of teaching life-saving skills.     I wonder how many other stories like this exist where human effort is overshadowed by the need to attribute outcomes to a deity. It’s a reminder of how deeply ingrained these beliefs are in our culture, and how they can sometimes lead us to ignore the real heroes in our lives.
__label__0 Hi all! I'm graduating with my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in 3 weeks from a CACREP accredited university. I currently reside in Virginia, and I was actually able to sit for the NCMHCE in November 2021, and I passed! My husband and I are moving, and I'm applying for licensure in Ohio. From what I've gathered about licensing in Ohio, in order to get your LPC license, you need to have taken the NCE. After a few years of supervision and after passing the NCMHCE, THEN you can become an LPCC. Would anyone happen to know if me already passing the NCMHCE would matter in Ohio? Would I still need to take the NCE?

__label__1 I’ve been rewatching season 4 of Stranger Things, and I can’t help but wonder about the significance of the salt from Surfer Boi Pizza. When the gang was trying to figure out how to defeat Vecna, they mentioned needing a lot of salt. It got me thinking: why salt?     In many cultures, salt is often associated with protection and purification. It’s used in rituals to ward off evil spirits, which makes sense given the supernatural elements of the show. Plus, it’s a common ingredient in various spells and potions in folklore.     But beyond the mystical aspect, could it also be a nod to the idea of preserving memories? The kids are trying to hold onto their childhood and the bonds they’ve formed, and salt has been used historically to preserve food and, metaphorically, moments in time.     What do you all think? Was the salt just a quirky detail, or is there a deeper meaning behind it? I’d love to hear your theories!

__label__1 Hey fellow Travelers!     I wanted to share my current Abyss team compositions and get your thoughts on them. I’ve been struggling a bit with the higher floors, and I’m curious to see what teams you all are using to tackle the Abyss.     **My Current Teams:**    1. **Team 1:** Hu Tao (DPS), Xingqiu (Sub-DPS), Albedo (Shield/Support), and Bennett (Healer/Support)       - This team has been working well for me in terms of damage output, especially with Hu Tao’s burst. I love how Xingqiu’s Hydro application helps with Hu Tao’s reactions.     2. **Team 2:** Raiden Shogun (DPS), Fischl (Sub-DPS), Zhongli (Shield), and Barbara (Healer)       - Raiden’s burst is a game-changer, and with Zhongli’s shield, I feel a bit more secure. Fischl’s Electro application is great for triggering reactions, especially with Raiden’s abilities.     I’m currently on Floor 11 and struggling with the enemies there. Any tips on how to optimize these teams or suggestions for different characters? I’ve also been considering swapping out Barbara for another character, but I’m not sure who would fit best.     Looking forward to hearing your team compositions and strategies! Let’s help each other out in conquering the Abyss!

__label__0 A couple day ago, while i opened bluestacks 5, and none of the images for any of the games i had installed loaded. I thought it was odd but ignored it an continued as normal playing summoners war (a game that requires internet connection). When i get off the app and try to use Google my computer, it tells me i have no internet. I checked if the internet was down, but my computer said it was connected to the router with full bars. I tryed looking at task manager to see if bluestacks was open still, doing background possesses or something, but no. There wss nothing open, nothong but the system itself.  I restarted the computer 3 times, still no internet.  I didnt know what to do. so i thought i would just uninstall it, cause it had been the only one with internet. I thought maybe i just glitched it and it was taking the internet somehow, so i uninstalled it. But i still have no internet on my computer. Im not sure what to do now... So im here asking for advice.  I you would, please tell me how i can fix the issue. I'd really appreciate it.

__label__1 With the rise of streaming services and various online platforms, there are now plenty of ways to watch sports in South Africa without relying solely on DStv. Here are some alternatives that might interest you:    1. **Streaming Services**: Platforms like Showmax Pro offer live sports streaming, including soccer, rugby, and cricket. They often have packages that include both live sports and on-demand content.    2. **YouTube**: Many sports leagues and teams have official channels where they stream games or provide highlights. You can catch up on matches and even watch live events depending on the league.    3. **Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook and Twitter sometimes stream live sports events. For example, certain matches or highlights may be available for free on these platforms.    4. **Local Sports Apps**: Check out apps like SuperSport, which provide live scores, updates, and sometimes live streaming of games. They also offer highlights and analysis.    5. **Radio and Podcasts**: If you’re not too keen on watching, you can always listen to live commentary on radio stations or through sports podcasts that cover your favorite teams and leagues.    6. **VPN Services**: If you’re looking for international sports coverage, using a VPN can help you access streaming services from other countries that might have different sports broadcasting rights.    7. **Community Sports Bars**: If you enjoy the atmosphere of watching sports with others, consider visiting local sports bars or pubs that show live games. It’s a great way to enjoy the game and meet fellow fans.    What are your favorite ways to catch sports without DStv? Any recommendations for specific apps or services?

__label__1 Hi everyone!     I'm currently looking for the lowest interest rates available for personal loans in the Philippines. I've heard about some crowd-sourcing platforms that might offer competitive rates, but I'm not sure which ones are the best or most reliable.     If anyone has experience with these platforms or knows of any specific lenders that offer low rates, I would really appreciate your insights! Also, if you could share any tips on how to improve my chances of getting approved for a loan, that would be great too.     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I recently started experimenting with using GPT-3 to generate news stories specifically focused on artificial intelligence. The idea is to create engaging and informative articles that reflect current trends, breakthroughs, and discussions in the AI field.     I’ve been using a variety of prompts to guide the model, such as asking it to summarize recent AI research papers, report on AI ethics debates, or even create fictional news stories about future AI technologies. The results have been quite fascinating, but I’ve also encountered some challenges.     One major issue is ensuring the accuracy of the information. While GPT-3 can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, it sometimes produces statements that are misleading or factually incorrect. I’ve been implementing a verification step where I cross-check the generated content against reliable sources, but this can be time-consuming.     Another challenge is maintaining a consistent tone and style that aligns with reputable news outlets. I’ve been experimenting with different training techniques, such as fine-tuning the model on a dataset of actual news articles, but I’m curious if anyone else has had success with this or has other strategies to recommend.     I’d love to hear your thoughts on using GPT-3 for news generation, any tips you might have for improving accuracy and style, or examples of your own projects in this area. Has anyone else tried similar approaches? What were your experiences?
__label__1 I've been playing Lee Sin for a while now and I’m looking for some tips to improve my gameplay with him. I know he’s a high-skill champion with a lot of mobility and potential for outplays, but I often find myself struggling to make the most of his kit.     Here are a few specific areas where I could use some advice:    1. **Early Game Strategy**: What’s the best way to utilize Lee Sin in the early game? Should I focus on ganking lanes or farming?     2. **Skill Order**: What’s the optimal skill order for Lee Sin? I’ve seen different builds, and I’m not sure which one maximizes his potential.    3. **Combo Execution**: I often find myself fumbling my combos in team fights. What are some effective combos to practice that can help me secure kills or peel for my team?    4. **Ward Jumping**: I know Lee Sin can use wards to jump around, but I’m not very confident in my ward placement. Any tips on how to effectively use this mechanic in both offensive and defensive situations?    5. **Team Fight Positioning**: How should I position myself in team fights? I want to be able to engage effectively without getting blown up immediately.    Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I recently had an experience that I can only describe as a close encounter of the third kind, but instead of the typical alien abduction narrative, it was more about love and connection.     It all started one night when I was stargazing in my backyard. I’ve always been fascinated by the cosmos, and that night, the sky was particularly clear. As I was lying there, I noticed a bright light moving erratically across the sky. At first, I thought it was just a satellite or a plane, but it was moving in ways that defied conventional flight patterns.     Intrigued, I grabbed my phone to record it. As I focused on the light, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and warmth wash over me. It was as if the light was communicating with me, not through words, but through emotions. I felt a deep sense of love and acceptance, something I had been longing for in my life.     Suddenly, the light blinked and then shot off into the distance, leaving me in awe. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was more than just a random sighting. It felt personal, as if the universe was reminding me of the love that exists all around us, even if we can’t always see it.     In the days that followed, I found myself more open to love in my life. I reached out to friends I hadn’t spoken to in a while, and I even started dating someone I had been interested in for ages. It was as if that encounter had shifted my perspective, allowing me to embrace connections that I had previously overlooked.     I know this might sound a bit out there, but I truly believe that my experience was a reminder that love is a universal force, one that transcends our earthly existence. Has anyone else had a similar experience where they felt a connection to something greater, perhaps even extraterrestrial, that led to a deeper understanding of love in their lives?

Anyway been able to strengthen the wrists at all?     I know I should rest but I can’t get away from work and having to re-rack stuff. I’ve stopped training for 4 days and it seems to be getting better.     Any advice would be great.
__label__1 Is there anything more gut-wrenching than the moment you hold your brand new phone, all shiny and perfect, only to have it slip from your fingers and smash on the tile floor?     You can practically hear the collective gasp of everyone around you as you watch it fall in slow motion. The anticipation of that first crack, the dread of what you’ll find when you pick it up. And of course, it’s always the screen that shatters, isn’t it?     Now I’m left with a phone that looks like it’s been through a war zone, and I’m just here trying to figure out how to explain to my mates why I’m suddenly using a phone that looks like it’s been in a blender.     Why do we even bother with these sleek designs when they’re so prone to disaster? I swear, I need a phone that can survive a drop or two without turning into a jigsaw puzzle.     British problems, am I right?
__label__1 I've recently started exploring the SWIFT model (Structured Writing Instruction for Focused Teaching) in my classroom, and I'm curious if anyone else has experience with it.     For those who might not be familiar, the SWIFT model emphasizes structured writing instruction that helps students develop their writing skills in a more focused and systematic way. It breaks down the writing process into manageable steps, which I find particularly helpful for my students who struggle with writing.     I've been implementing it in my 5th-grade class, and I've noticed that my students are becoming more confident in their writing abilities. We start with brainstorming ideas, then move on to organizing those ideas into an outline, and finally, we draft and revise. I also incorporate peer reviews, which has been a great way for them to learn from each other.     However, I’m still figuring out how to best adapt the model for different learning styles and needs. I’d love to hear from others who have used the SWIFT model. What strategies have worked for you? Have you faced any challenges? Any tips on how to make it even more effective in the classroom?     Looking forward to your insights!
__label__1 Hello everyone! I'm a complete newbie to Dungeons & Dragons and I'm looking for a friendly group to join online. I’ve always been fascinated by the game and I’m eager to learn the ropes while having some fun adventures with others.    A little about me:  - I’m in my late 20s and I’m excited to dive into the world of roleplaying.  - I’m open to playing any class or race, and I’m particularly interested in exploring character development and storytelling.  - I’m available most evenings during the week (PST) and flexible on weekends.  - I’m a quick learner and I’m ready to soak up all the knowledge I can from more experienced players.    I would love to find a group that is patient and willing to help a first-timer get started. I’m looking for a campaign that balances roleplay and combat, and I’m open to both homebrew and established settings.    If you have a spot for a newbie in your campaign or know of a group that welcomes beginners, please reach out! I’m excited to embark on this journey and make some new friends along the way. Thanks for considering me!

__label__0 I want to upgrade from my EOS R, and the $3.9k R5 makes the most sense for my needs. I bid for one on Ebay assuming I'd be outbid, but ended up with the winning bid at $3150.

__label__0 Hello! I've posted in here before, but thought I'd give it a go once more.     **ONLY LOOKING FOR WOMEN**    I'm a 28 year old woman living in the eastern midwest of the US. I have a partner and three kids. I work in manufacturing and work long hours. I'm 5'2 and chubby/midsize. Got that mom bod. My hair is short. I shaved it for two head tattoos and to start over with healthier hair. Speaking of tattoos, I have close to 40 with more planned. I love to play Pokémon on my switch (unite and story line). I am a big anime fan. I am queer. I'm looking for a potential girlfriend with all of the prerequisites involved. Long distance is okay with me, as well as a time difference, but I'm not looking to be catfished. So once comfortable with each other I'd like to video chat.     If any of that resonates with you, message me.

__label__1 I’ve been in a relationship for a little over a year now, and while I care about my partner deeply, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be rushing things. We’ve talked about moving in together and even getting engaged, but every time I think about it, I feel this knot in my stomach.     I love him, but I also feel like I haven’t fully explored who I am as an individual. I’ve always been the type to jump into things headfirst, but this time, I want to be more cautious. I want to make sure that I’m not just settling down because it feels like the next step.     I’ve been thinking about taking a step back and focusing on myself for a while. I want to travel, pursue my hobbies, and just enjoy life without the pressure of a serious commitment. But I’m terrified of what that might mean for my relationship.     What if he doesn’t understand? What if he thinks I don’t love him enough? I don’t want to hurt him, but I also don’t want to lose myself in the process. I feel so conflicted.     I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I’m not sure what the right decision is, but I think I need to wait and figure things out for myself before making any big moves.

__label__1 I’ve been playing a lot of Shadow Royale lately, and I’ve noticed a frustrating trend that I think we need to address as a community: the constant thirsting of knocked players.     I get it, it’s a competitive game and every kill counts, but in Shadow Royale, where players can come back as shadows, it feels like a waste to finish off a downed opponent. Instead of thirsting, why not let them get revived and have a fair fight? It adds to the fun and chaos of the mode, and honestly, it’s more enjoyable to have a full squad to battle against rather than just picking off the weak.     Plus, it can lead to some epic moments when you let someone revive and then you all end up in a crazy showdown. I think we should encourage more of that spirit of fun and camaraderie, even in a battle royale setting.     What do you all think? Are you team thirst or team revive? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__0 So my graduation is this summer. It was delayed because of covid. Originally my university said we would only be getting two guest tickets each and I decided those two tickets would be going to my parents, who are coming from abroad to see me graduate.       Last week i got an email saying i’d been awarded two extra guest tickets so now so have 4, meaning my grandparents can come. My grandma has been asking if there is any way for me to get them tickets and the answer was no but now they could come. I haven’t told anyone yet about the extra tickets.       Here’s my dilemma, because i don’t really want my grandparents coming for these reasons:  - They are very racist and I am worried my grandma will make racist comments about, or to, other graduates or staff. They’ve done this before to my friends.   - During covid I couldn’t fly home but when my lease was up they refused to let me move back in with them, which effectively made me homeless and my friends had to take me in. In this time they were still seeing friends and breaking rules all the time.   - My Grandmas husband spent most of my time at uni making fun of my degree.   - They aren’t very good at following rules in formal events (getting up and wandering around, inappropriate cheering, starting convos with random people etc)      My grandma also spent the last month threatening to come in anyway and cause problems despite me asking her not to.   I know they will be upset that they can’t come, but considering they don’t know there are tickets WIBTA for not telling them and giving the tickets away?      EDIT: They are old and I feel bad because they try to be nice and they do really want to come

In PvP, the marks don't seem to trigger consistently, and I often find myself getting outgunned by other snipers.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is the Mantis broken, or am I just not using it to its full potential? Any tips or insights would be appreciated!

__label__0 The difference between 20 years ago and 10 years again seems pretty obvious, 10 years ago and today much less to, at least to my eye. Technologically, what advances are there really left to be made? At least in terms of what matters for film--resolution, color and lighting accuracy, motion, etc. If I do some cursory googling about the latest tech, it's all about relatively irrelevant features like capture in the dark, size and cost, things like that.    Is the video produced by state-of-the-art cameras not yet, for all intents and purposes, perfection, at least with relation to capturing a two-dimensional image meant to be presented on a limited two-dimensional display such as a television or theater screen? It seems resolution is already pretty much maxed out, insofar as I can sit closer to my 65" 4K display than it is wide and barely tell the difference compared to 1080p in most cases. Or is that actually evidence that cameras don't *truly* do a good job of capturing a full 4K or detail in motion?

__label__1 I just wanted to share my thoughts on the current pay rates in the trucking industry. I recently came across a job listing that offered $20 an hour for local driving, and it got me thinking about how far we've come and how much things have changed.    When I first started driving, it was common to see pay rates that were significantly higher for OTR drivers, especially considering the long hours and time away from home. Now, it seems like many local jobs are offering rates that are barely above minimum wage, especially when you factor in the wear and tear on your vehicle and the rising costs of living.    I understand that local driving can have its perks, like being home every night, but $20 an hour just doesn’t seem to cut it anymore. With the rising fuel prices, maintenance costs, and the general cost of living, it feels like we’re undervaluing our work.     What are your thoughts? Is $20 an hour a fair wage for local drivers, or should we be pushing for better pay? I’d love to hear what others in the community think about this.

The story revolves around a young boy who has a unique ability to see people's emotions represented as clouds. Each emotion has a different color and shape, which allows him to understand how others are feeling. I remember it being a touching and insightful read, exploring themes of empathy and connection. If anyone knows the title or similar books with a focus on emotions and perception, I would really appreciate your suggestions!
__label__0 Been looking for weeks on and off about 100 in game hours for my perfect home planet. Am in Eissentam galaxy.    I want and I found a planet with all this:  Emerald green grass  Blue water (not teal)  Blue sky  Bovinesque animals - none that aggro   No sentinels  No weather  BUBBLES  View of ringed planet  Bioluminescent   Settlement near water and can build base overlooking.    I love it! I looked so hard for it.    But it is in a one star system so that sucks.  Should I keep looking? Am still building a base here and getting my settlement going.    Can’t help but feel I might find all this in a higher tier system if I put in the time.    Pics in comments
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m really interested in starting my own dispensary and I’m looking for some advice on how to get started with supply. I know that sourcing quality products is crucial, but I’m not sure where to begin.      1. **Finding Suppliers**: What are the best ways to find reliable suppliers for both flower and edibles? Are there specific trade shows or online platforms that you recommend?      2. **Quality Control**: How do you ensure that the products you’re sourcing meet quality standards? Are there certifications or testing processes I should be aware of?      3. **Legal Considerations**: What legal aspects should I keep in mind when sourcing products? I want to make sure I’m compliant with all regulations in my state.      4. **Building Relationships**: How important is it to build relationships with suppliers? Any tips on how to approach them and negotiate terms?      I’d love to hear your experiences and any advice you have! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 It's a range attack is called Rock...it is not called Thrown attack.    First off where would a giant ape get rocks from? Rocks that fits the palm of a huge creatures just doesnt randomly lie around in most terrains. Especially if we go by the steriotype that these creatures lives in jungles/forest.    This means that the crearure actually shoots rocks from its body just like a Manticore shoots spikes from its tail.    Imagine a monkey with either like rocks potruding from its back and shoots it like an artillery or that one of its arms is like a cannon or something that lobs rocks like a organic grenade caster
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m looking to level up quickly and was wondering what the fastest race and class combination is for a level 1 character. I’ve heard that certain races have racial abilities that can help with leveling speed, and I want to make sure I pick the best combo to get through those early levels as fast as possible.     Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I've been thinking about how EA seems to have a pattern when it comes to pack luck, especially for those of us on the EA Play Pro subscription. It feels like right before your subscription is about to expire, the game suddenly decides to bless you with some insane pack luck.     I mean, how many times have you opened a pack and pulled a top-tier player just days before your subscription runs out? It’s almost like they want to keep you hooked and make you feel like you need to renew to keep that luck going.     I’ve seen countless posts from players who have experienced this phenomenon, and I can’t help but wonder if there’s some sort of algorithm at play here. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, or maybe EA is subtly nudging us to keep that subscription active.     Has anyone else noticed this trend? What’s the best player you’ve packed right before your subscription expired? Let’s hear your stories!
__label__1 I've been following the developments around Luna Classic and its trading on Binance, and I wanted to share my thoughts and hear what others think.     Binance has been a major player in the crypto exchange space, and their support for Luna Classic has been crucial for its liquidity and trading volume. However, I've noticed some fluctuations in the trading pairs and the overall sentiment in the community.     Recently, there have been discussions about potential listings and delistings, which can significantly impact the price and accessibility of LUNC. I believe that if Binance continues to support LUNC and possibly even introduces new trading pairs, it could lead to a resurgence in interest and investment in the token.     On the flip side, if they decide to delist or reduce support, it could have a negative effect. I'm curious to hear how everyone else feels about Binance's role in the future of Luna Classic. Do you think their support is enough to drive the price up, or are we at risk of losing momentum? Let's discuss!
__label__0 Is it controlling to ask my boyfriend to respect my request that they just meet in a public place or at least not chill at eachothers houses alone together? They can study at Starbucks or somewhere else. Would you honor your partner by asking the friend to make boundaries ? Edit: he knows I get annoyed when they see each other cuz me and her had a falling out recently and don’t like each other at all. I found out he saw her twice this week and didn’t tell me. One of the times she came over. And he lied about all of it until I found out by asking more questions
__label__1 I was involved in a car accident a few months ago and I was awarded a settlement from the insurance company. However, I have not received the payment yet, and it has been over a month since the settlement was agreed upon. I have tried contacting the insurance company multiple times, but I keep getting the runaround.     I’m wondering if I have any legal recourse to sue for the settlement winnings. Is there a specific process I need to follow to initiate a lawsuit against the insurance company for not paying the settlement? Also, would it be advisable to consult with a lawyer before taking any action? Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I recently came across a manga called "Wildman's Book Scam" and I can't stop thinking about it! The story follows a young man who discovers a mysterious book that grants him the ability to manipulate reality through the stories he writes. At first, he uses this power for fun and personal gain, but things take a dark turn when he realizes that every change he makes has unintended consequences.    The art style is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that really bring the world to life. The characters are well-developed, each with their own motivations and struggles, which makes the story even more engaging. I love how the manga explores themes of power, responsibility, and the impact of one's choices.    Has anyone else read this? I’d love to hear your thoughts on the plot twists and character arcs! Also, if you have any recommendations for similar manga, please share!

__label__1 I've been using the "Kukulkan's Wrath" hammer lately, and I have to say, it's quickly becoming my favorite! The design is just stunning, and the elemental damage it deals is a game changer in fights against monsters like Magnamalo and Goss Harag.     The ability to stun monsters with the charged attacks is so satisfying, especially when you see them stagger and fall over. Plus, the extra damage from the elemental effects really helps in those tougher hunts.     I also love how versatile the hammer is; I can switch between focusing on raw damage and elemental damage depending on the monster I'm facing.     What about you all? What’s your favorite hammer and why? Any specific builds or strategies you recommend? Let’s share some tips!
__label__0 I love part royale. About six months ago I had like two rare emote and they were flapper and praise the tomato. Now that came back I haven’t really had any fun in party royale! Sucks am. Cause I could do gotten fresh and rambunctious back then but my dumbass didn’t ugh. My only rare thing at the moment and I’m holding it on for dear life is the black widow skin but that’s it everything else isn’t hitting right. Do I have a problem I think about this all the tile and how I didn’t buy fresh and rambunctious back then.

__label__0 My 6 year old did the glitch to keep the light bow. He followed that up with the glitch that, when visiting links house, lets you duplicate them and now he has 6 light bows. The problem is that now all the monsters have disappeared from the game. You can’t drop the bows and going back to a previous save point isn’t an option.     Any ideas?
__label__1 I recently started making my own leggings and I'm looking for the best way to hem them. I've heard that a coverstitch machine is ideal for this type of project, but I'm not entirely sure how to use it effectively for hemming leggings.     Can anyone share their experiences with using a coverstitch machine for this purpose? What settings do you recommend? Are there any tips or tricks to ensure a professional-looking finish? Also, do you think it's worth investing in a coverstitch machine if I plan to make a lot of activewear?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 When it comes to starting a new project or venture, I believe in a few key strategies that have helped me along the way. Here’s what I typically follow:    1. **Define Your Goals**: Before diving into anything, I take the time to clearly define what I want to achieve. This could be anything from launching a blog, starting a business, or learning a new skill. Having specific, measurable goals helps keep me focused.    2. **Research and Plan**: I spend time researching my chosen field or niche. This includes understanding the market, identifying my target audience, and analyzing competitors. I create a rough plan outlining the steps I need to take to reach my goals.    3. **Start Small**: I believe in starting small and scaling up. Instead of trying to launch a fully-fledged product or service right away, I often begin with a minimum viable product (MVP) or a pilot version. This allows me to test the waters and gather feedback without a huge upfront investment.    4. **Consistency is Key**: I make it a point to work on my project consistently, even if it’s just a little bit each day. This helps build momentum and keeps me engaged with my goals.    5. **Seek Feedback**: I actively seek feedback from peers, mentors, or my target audience. Constructive criticism is invaluable and can help me refine my approach and improve my offerings.    6. **Adapt and Iterate**: I stay flexible and open to change. If something isn’t working, I’m not afraid to pivot or adjust my strategy based on what I learn from feedback and results.    7. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Finally, I make sure to celebrate small milestones along the way. This keeps me motivated and reminds me of the progress I’m making.    Overall, the key is to just start, take action, and be willing to learn and adapt as you go. What strategies do you follow? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been playing WoW since the early days, and I have to say, Dragonflight has left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. I wanted to share some of my thoughts and see if anyone else feels the same way.    First off, the story feels a bit disjointed. While the concept of exploring the Dragon Isles is exciting, the execution seems lacking. The quests often feel repetitive, and I find myself zoning out during the cutscenes. I miss the days when the lore felt more cohesive and engaging.    Secondly, the class balance seems off. I’ve noticed that some classes are just dominating in both PvE and PvP, while others are struggling to find their place. It’s frustrating to see the same few specs being favored in raids and arenas, making it hard for players who enjoy off-meta choices to find groups.    Also, the new talent system, while it has potential, feels overwhelming. I appreciate the customization, but it can be hard to figure out the best builds without extensive research. I miss the simplicity of the old system where you could just pick a few talents without having to worry about a million different combinations.    Lastly, the community feels a bit fractured. With the introduction of new systems and features, it seems like players are more focused on their own progression rather than helping each other out. I remember when the community was more tight-knit, and players would band together to tackle challenges.    I really want to love Dragonflight, but these issues are making it hard for me to fully enjoy the expansion. What do you all think? Are there aspects of Dragonflight that you feel are lacking, or am I just being overly critical?
__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but I genuinely think oatmeal and oatmeal raisin cookies are disgusting. The texture of oatmeal is just unappealing to me; it’s mushy and bland, and I can’t understand why people rave about it as a breakfast option.     As for oatmeal raisin cookies, they’re the worst kind of cookie. You expect a chocolate chip cookie, and then you bite into a chewy, raisin-filled disappointment. Raisins are just dried-up grapes that have lost all their flavor and texture, and they ruin what could be a perfectly good cookie.     I get that some people love them, but I just don’t see the appeal. Give me a chocolate chip cookie any day over those sad, raisin-filled imposters.
__label__0 This is the 237843rd time I made this shitty comment.  I hate this job.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm planning a trip to Turkey in November 2022 and I'm really excited to explore the techno and EDM scene in Istanbul and Cappadocia.     I’ve heard that Istanbul has a vibrant nightlife with some amazing clubs and events, but I’m not sure where to start looking for gigs. If anyone has recommendations for clubs, artists, or specific events happening in November, I would love to hear about them!     Also, I’m curious about Cappadocia. I know it’s more known for its stunning landscapes and hot air balloon rides, but are there any underground parties or smaller events that feature electronic music?     Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to experiencing the music culture in Turkey!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about Erika Jayne and her behavior this season on RHOBH. It’s hard to watch someone who seems so detached from the struggles of others, especially when her own life is in such turmoil. I mean, she’s been through a lot, but her lack of empathy towards her castmates is really off-putting.     When she dismisses their feelings or makes snide comments about their problems, it just feels like she’s completely lost touch with reality. I get that she’s trying to protect herself and maybe even put on a brave face, but it’s hard to feel sorry for someone who doesn’t show any compassion for others.     I think it’s fair to say that if she can’t extend a little kindness or understanding, then why should we feel any sympathy for her? It’s a two-way street, and right now, she’s driving in the wrong lane. What do you all think? Are you still rooting for Erika, or has her attitude turned you off completely?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm trying to decide between taking BCH 361 B with the B session or with Professor Chen. If anyone has experience with either option, I would love to hear your thoughts on the course structure, workload, and teaching style. Any insights on which might be a better choice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I recently started the process of applying for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) using Form W-7, and I have a few questions that I hope someone here can help me with.    1. **Supporting Documentation**: I understand that I need to provide original documents or certified copies to prove my identity and foreign status. Can anyone clarify what types of documents are acceptable? I have a passport, but do I need to include anything else?    2. **Filing Status**: I’m unsure about how to indicate my filing status on the form. I’m applying for an ITIN because I’m a non-resident alien and need it for tax purposes. Should I select ‘Single’ or is there a different option that applies to my situation?    3. **Processing Time**: How long does it typically take to receive the ITIN after submitting Form W-7? I’ve heard varying reports, and I’m trying to plan accordingly since I need it for my tax return.    4. **Where to Send the Form**: I’ve seen different instructions online about where to send the completed Form W-7. Should I send it to the address listed on the form, or is there a specific IRS office that handles ITIN applications?    5. **Renewal of ITIN**: If I already have an ITIN but it has expired, do I need to fill out a new Form W-7, or is there a different process for renewing it?    Any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 With the upcoming Sumeru region, I can't help but hope for a new mechanic that introduces a genie-like character who grants us three wishes! Imagine the possibilities: we could wish for unique weapons, rare materials, or even special character skins.     It would be such a fun twist to the gameplay, allowing us to strategize our wishes based on our current needs or future plans. Plus, it would fit perfectly with the mystical and magical themes of Sumeru.     What do you all think? What would your three wishes be if this mechanic were to be introduced? Let's get creative!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm an 18-year-old guy just looking for someone to chat and chill with. I'm open to talking about anything, whether it's movies, music, gaming, or just life in general.

__label__0 As is tradition it seems, the Whale Apes stir up the excitement, to circle in the gullible Minnow Apes for a feeding frenzy. Works every time, shoulda learned from the GME/AMC days, now BBBY goes on the board for dark days. I think I've finally got the hint that MEME stocks are about as reckless and insanely irresponsible to get dooped into as it gets...
__label__0 I’m not talking 6-weeks - I’m more like giving the mother a reasonable amount of time to decide, so either end of the first or second trimester? Anything past that has to be exceptional and approved by a board of doctors, which is how most late term abortions work now anyway.     I just want to see how we can meet in the middle on this.
__label__1 I've been on the hunt for a good sunscreen that provides a matte finish and is suitable for my combination acne-prone skin. I’ve tried a few options, but I’m looking for recommendations that are lightweight, non-comedogenic, and preferably invisible on the skin.     Currently, I’ve been using a gel-based sunscreen, but it still leaves a bit of a sheen that I’m not a fan of. I’ve heard that mineral sunscreens can sometimes be heavy and leave a white cast, which is something I want to avoid.     If anyone has found a sunscreen that fits the bill—matte finish, invisible, and works well with acne-prone skin—I would love to hear your suggestions! Also, if you have any tips on how to layer it with other products in my routine, that would be super helpful too! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’m curious to hear about others’ experiences with therapy and how their narcissistic parents handled it. My N-parent sent me to therapy when I was a teenager, but it was never for my benefit. It was more about controlling the narrative and making sure I didn’t talk about the real issues at home.     I remember my first session vividly. My mom insisted on coming with me, claiming she wanted to support me. But as soon as we got there, she started talking over me, telling the therapist how I was the problem and how I needed to change. It felt like I was being put on trial instead of receiving help.     The therapist tried to get me to open up, but I felt so pressured to agree with my mom’s version of events. I was terrified of what would happen if I said anything that contradicted her. After a few sessions, I realized that I wasn’t getting any help; I was just being further manipulated.     Eventually, I stopped going. I told my mom I didn’t want to go anymore, and she flipped out, saying I was just trying to avoid facing my issues. It was so frustrating because I felt like I was being punished for wanting to speak my truth.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? Did your N-parent send you to therapy, and if so, how did it go? Did you find a way to get the help you needed despite their interference?
__label__1 I recently built my PC, and I'm having an issue with the CPU fan not spinning at all. I’ve double-checked all the connections, and everything seems to be plugged in correctly. The fan is connected to the CPU fan header on the motherboard, and I’ve also tried connecting it to a different fan header just to rule out a faulty header.    Here are some details about my build:  - CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X  - Motherboard: MSI B550 Gaming Plus  - CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212  - PSU: Corsair 650W    When I power on the system, the motherboard lights up, and I can hear the PSU fan spinning, but the CPU fan remains completely still. I’ve tried the following troubleshooting steps:  1. **Checked BIOS settings**: I entered the BIOS and checked the fan settings. The CPU fan is set to run at a minimum speed, but it still doesn’t spin.  2. **Reseated the cooler**: I removed the cooler and reattached it, ensuring that it’s seated properly and that the thermal paste is applied correctly.  3. **Tested the fan**: I connected the CPU fan to a different PC to see if it spins there, and it works fine, so the fan itself is not the issue.  4. **Checked for shorts**: I made sure there are no shorts between the motherboard and the case.    I’m starting to think it might be a motherboard issue, but I’d love to hear if anyone has experienced something similar or has any other suggestions. Thanks in advance!
__label__0 So I’ve never posted here, but I think it’s time..  First, some back story; I’ve been working for a regional pool and recreation company for the last year, working as their lead chemical (pools and hot tubs) salesperson for a year. I was named “rookie of the year” at our end of year banquet, and given 2 (small) raises while there. I was praised for my work.  Well around May, the work load was starting to be too much, I was taking care of all the inventory, selling, and educating in my department, I had reached my “cap” for my position, and they were bringing in another guy from another store to completely change my entire department.   I’d had enough and put in my notice. They let me leave before my two weeks were up but a few days after leaving, the regional manager called and essentially begged me to stay with the company, told me the ceo was upset I was gone blah blah blah.   I am a people pleaser to a fault, so it was nice to feel wanted..  Well they basically offered me another, better position. No selling, better pay, etc.   In our meeting, the COO asked what I needed pay-wise to be comfortable and not worried about finances. I told him my number and he and another person agreed that that was pretty standard starting out in this position.  3.5 weeks go by, I haven’t started yet. I am so broke at this point, because they said it was supposed to be 4 days.  Finally!! They give me a start date and I’m expected to drive 4 hours away to be put up in a hotel for 3 days to shadow someone in my position.   &amp; when I get there, they finally send me the offer letter.  And it’s the hourly I had before I left..  Not even close to what we discussed.  I bring it up to my new boss, and he comes back to me saying they can’t change anything now. And that once I’m done training, and are on my own, I’d get the raise….  Is this right?? I’m so frustrated but had no other choice but to accept because I’ve now been out of work for a month.  Ugh.
__label__1 With the recent success of Disney+ series like "WandaVision" and "Loki," I think it's the perfect time for Marvel to explore a new series centered around Agent Peggy Carter and Captain America, particularly focusing on their relationship from the 1940s all the way to the 2010s.     Imagine a show that dives deep into their adventures during World War II, showcasing not only their battles against Hydra but also the personal moments that defined their bond. We could see Peggy's evolution as a leader in S.H.I.E.L.D. and how she coped with Steve's absence after he was frozen.     Fast forward to the modern era, and we could explore how Peggy's legacy influenced the Avengers and how she navigated the changing world after Steve's return. This could also be a great opportunity to introduce flashbacks or alternate timelines, especially with the multiverse being a significant theme in the MCU now.     Plus, with Hayley Atwell's return as Peggy and the potential for Chris Evans to reprise his role in some capacity, it could be a nostalgic yet fresh take on their story.     What do you all think? Would you be excited to see a series that captures the essence of their relationship over the decades?

__label__1 I recently encountered a frustrating issue with my AOC monitor's built-in speakers. They were working perfectly fine, but suddenly they vanished from the sound output list on my computer. I've tried a few troubleshooting steps, but nothing seems to work.     Here’s what I’ve done so far:  1. **Checked Connections**: I made sure that the monitor is properly connected to my PC via HDMI, as that’s how the audio is transmitted.  2. **Restarted Everything**: I rebooted both my monitor and my computer, hoping it would reset any glitches.  3. **Updated Drivers**: I checked for any updates for my audio drivers and the monitor’s firmware, but everything is up to date.  4. **Sound Settings**: I went into the sound settings on my PC to see if the monitor was just disabled, but it’s not listed at all.  5. **Different Ports**: I tried using different HDMI ports on the monitor and even switched cables, but still no luck.    Has anyone else experienced this issue with their AOC monitor? Any suggestions on how to get the speakers back in the sound output list? I’d appreciate any help or advice!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’ve been thinking a lot about a conversation I had recently, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. Someone mentioned that they believe certain phrases or jokes about gender identity can be inherently transphobic, even if the person saying them doesn’t intend to be harmful.     For example, they pointed out that jokes about someone being ‘confused’ about their gender can invalidate the experiences of trans and nonbinary individuals. It made me wonder if there are certain phrases or attitudes that we should be more aware of, especially in casual conversations.     I’m curious to hear your perspectives. Do you think there are specific things that are inherently transphobic, or is it more about the context and intent behind the words? How can we better educate ourselves and others to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes?    Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!     Best,    Jamie

__label__1 I've been on a weight loss journey for a few months now, and I'm feeling really frustrated. I've been consistently eating less than 1500 calories a day, tracking everything meticulously, and yet the scale just won't budge.     I’m a 30-year-old female, 5'5", and I started at 180 pounds. I’ve been trying to stick to a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. I also make sure to drink plenty of water and limit my intake of processed foods and sugars.     I exercise about 4-5 times a week, mixing cardio and strength training. I thought that with the calorie deficit and regular workouts, I would see some progress, but it feels like I’m stuck in a rut.     Has anyone else experienced this? I’m wondering if there’s something I might be missing or if my body is just adjusting to the lower calorie intake. Should I consider changing my approach, maybe increasing my calories slightly or switching up my workout routine? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 Hey everyone!      I wanted to share a recent post we created about building a GraphQL API using NestJS. If you're interested in modern web development practices, especially with TypeScript and Node.js, this might be a great resource for you.      In the post, we cover:    - Setting up a NestJS project    - Integrating GraphQL with Apollo Server    - Creating resolvers and schemas    - Handling queries and mutations    - Best practices for structuring your API      Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with GraphQL or an experienced developer wanting to refine your skills, I think you'll find some valuable insights.      Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts! Any feedback or questions are welcome.      Happy coding!
__label__1 I just had the craziest experience in a UDL! I was running through the dungeon, and everything was going smoothly until I stumbled upon a room that seemed impossible to clear.     There were so many enemies packed in there, and they just kept spawning! I tried to kite them, but it felt like I was fighting a never-ending wave of mobs. I even used my abilities, but it was like they were all immune to damage or something.     Has anyone else encountered a UDL like this? I thought I was going to get a sweet loot drop, but instead, I just ended up running for my life! It was both terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.     If anyone has tips on how to handle these situations or if you’ve found a similar unbeatable UDL, I’d love to hear your stories!
__label__1 I’ve been playing Weekend League for a while now, and I can’t help but notice that it feels like everyone is using the same players and strategies. It’s like I’m facing the same team over and over again, just with different names. I get that certain players are meta, but it’s getting a bit stale.     I mean, why even bother with names when it’s just a sea of the same top-tier cards? I’d love to see more variety in the teams we face. Maybe they should consider a system where you can’t use the same top 10 players or something to encourage creativity.     Anyone else feeling this way? What do you think could be done to shake things up in Weekend League?

__label__1 When it comes to sharing information with friends, there are certain topics that can lead to complications, misunderstandings, or even damage to relationships. Here are some types of information that might be best kept private:    1. **Financial Details**: Sharing specifics about your income, debts, or financial struggles can lead to awkwardness or jealousy. Money can be a sensitive topic, and discussing it too openly might change how your friends perceive you.    2. **Personal Relationships**: Details about your romantic relationships, especially if they involve conflicts or intimate issues, can be risky. Friends may feel uncomfortable or take sides, which can strain friendships.    3. **Health Issues**: While it’s important to have a support system, sharing too much about your health problems or mental health struggles can sometimes lead to unwanted advice or pity. It’s okay to share what you’re comfortable with, but be mindful of how much you disclose.    4. **Family Problems**: Family dynamics can be complicated, and sharing too much about family issues can lead to gossip or judgment. It’s often better to keep these matters private unless you’re seeking specific advice.    5. **Secrets of Others**: If someone confides in you, it’s crucial to respect their privacy. Sharing someone else's secrets can break trust and damage relationships.    6. **Future Plans**: Sometimes, sharing your big dreams or plans can lead to skepticism or negativity from others. It might be better to keep your aspirations to yourself until you’re ready to act on them.    7. **Personal Insecurities**: While it’s healthy to talk about insecurities with close friends, oversharing can lead to them viewing you differently or feeling uncomfortable. It’s important to find a balance.    8. **Controversial Opinions**: If you have strong opinions on sensitive topics (politics, religion, etc.), sharing them can lead to heated debates or rifts in friendships. It’s often wise to gauge the room before diving into these discussions.    Ultimately, the key is to know your friends well and understand their boundaries as well as your own. Trust your instincts about what feels right to share and what might be better kept private.
__label__1 I’m in my thirties and I’m finding it increasingly challenging to navigate my relationship with my parents. They still seem to have a strong hold on my life decisions, and while I appreciate their concern, it often feels like they don’t respect my autonomy as an adult.     For example, they frequently offer unsolicited advice on my career choices, relationships, and even my living situation. I know they mean well, but it can be overwhelming and frustrating. I often feel like I’m still that child who needs to seek their approval, even though I’ve been independent for years.     I’ve tried to set boundaries, but it often leads to guilt trips or them feeling hurt. I want to be able to share my life with them without feeling like I’m under a microscope or that I need to justify my choices.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do you manage the balance between wanting to maintain a close relationship with your parents while also asserting your independence? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.
__label__1 It’s funny how the phrases "It’s all uphill from here" and "It’s all downhill from here" can both imply that things are going to get more difficult. One suggests a struggle against gravity, while the other implies a loss of control. Yet, they both convey a sense of impending challenge. It’s a reminder that perspective can completely change the meaning of a situation, even when the words seem to contradict each other.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm 13 and looking for a long-term gaming buddy to play Apex Legends with whenever we can. I usually play in the evenings and on weekends, and I'm currently sitting around Silver 2. I main Wraith and sometimes play Lifeline, but I'm open to trying new legends too!    I just want someone chill to hang out with, have fun, and maybe even grind some ranked games together. I have a mic and would love to chat while we play, but it's totally fine if you don't have one.     No toxicity, please! I just want to enjoy the game and improve together. If you're interested, feel free to add me! Looking forward to making some new friends!
__label__0 I’m relatively new to Photoshop so maybe this is nothing more than a simple fix, but everything I’ve tried searching to fix this issue has come up with no promising results.    For context, I use Layer Masks ALOT especially Solid Color ones however recently when I use the brush tool on the inverted Layer mask the brush ends up transparent. My layer opacity is on normal, it’s at 100% opacity. My brush itself is 100% opacity, 100% Flow 0% Smoothing and 100% hardness. I’ve tried everything from trying new files to resetting every tool I have, I still can’t find a fix.    Does anyone have any suggestions?
__label__1 Hey plant lovers!    I’ve been trying to keep spider plants healthy for a while now, but I just can’t seem to get it right. I’ve had a couple of them, and they always end up looking droopy and sad after a few weeks. I’ve tried different watering schedules, varying light conditions, and even repotting them, but nothing seems to work.      I’ve read that spider plants are supposed to be pretty hardy, so I’m feeling a bit defeated.      Here are a few things I’ve noticed:    - I usually water them when the top inch of soil feels dry, but I’m worried I might be over or under-watering.    - They’re placed in a spot with bright, indirect light, but I’ve also tried moving them to a shadier area.    - I’ve noticed some brown tips on the leaves, which I think might be a sign of either too much fluoride in the water or underwatering?      If anyone has tips or advice on how to keep these little guys thriving, I would really appreciate it! What’s your secret to happy spider plants? Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I’ve struggled with my shoulder and arms (both) getting a really swollen and inflamed and it’s incredibly painful. I’ll feel it in my breast, chest, shoulder, elbow, deep in my bicep, and the length of my forearm. I have deep painful knots in my deltoids. The pain often radiates up my neck and into my jaw.   Of course, these flare ups never happen when I go to doctors appointments. But the pain is excruciating. The swelling is noticeable to the eye and I almost had to cut a ring off once if was so painful to have it around my engorged fingers.   Does anyone else struggle with this?
__label__0 so yesterday i decided to get my own overflux to do eman slayer, and decided to give my mana flux to my coop as a little gift instead of keeping the money from it. they wanted to do t4 revs to access crimson isle, but keep dying to it so i thought the mana flux would help out. i had previously thought it was soulbound since i never planned on selling it anyway, so i gave it to him thinking he’d put it to use. immediately after, i saw him put it on ah, which upset me cuz yknow i gifted him the items, not the coins. i took it off immediately and soulbound it then gave it back. he started yelling at me over how he needed the coins (despite the fact that he made more than the cost of mana flux in a day of f6) and how im a horrible coop. soon after he settled down, he started to ask me to carry him in dungeons. so AITA?
__label__0 Male, with more extreme and obvious natural side curves. My chest area is skinny and just the same size as my (not so obvious) big hips. My waist is smaller in proportion to my shoulders, chest, and hips so I have that "twink" figure that isn't obvious at all with my shirt on. I also started on my abs roughly 2 months ago so they're only vaguely visible, but they're not seeable yet — all just like Link. AMA.
__label__1 My girlfriend and I have both noticed that we've gained some weight recently, and it's been on my mind a lot. I love her just the way she is, but I also want us to be healthy together. I’m not sure how to approach this topic without hurting her feelings or making her feel self-conscious.     I’ve thought about suggesting we start cooking healthier meals together or going for walks, but I’m worried that she might take it the wrong way. I don’t want her to think I’m criticizing her or that I’m unhappy with her appearance.     Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? What are some gentle ways to encourage each other to be healthier without making it a big deal? Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 Hi everyone! I'm currently analyzing a piece of music and I've come across a chord that I'm having trouble identifying. The chord in question appears in the context of a progression, and I want to make sure I understand its function and name correctly.    The notes in the chord are: C, E, G#, and B.     At first glance, it seems like it could be a Cmaj7#5, but I'm not entirely sure. The presence of the G# is throwing me off a bit.     Could this chord also be interpreted as an A minor 6 (Am6) in first inversion? Or is there another way to look at it?     Additionally, I’d love to hear your thoughts on how this chord might function within the progression. Is it acting as a leading tone to a D minor chord, or does it serve a different purpose?     Thanks in advance for your help! I'm excited to learn more about this!
__label__0 Am I the only one who doesn't upgrade cards to infinity split whatsoever?    1. It makes the card look worse. Instead of a unique and fitting background you get a blend and generic bright rainbow-y background, which doesn't fit the character or his artstyle. Further than that: all of the infinity splits look almost the same. So during a match it takes individuality away from your deck.     2. Getting a shiny card with an effect like this was cool when you could get it randomly from a pack of physical spiderman cards. It was random and super-rare, so even if it didn't look that good, you'd still be intrigued to see someones' shiny card. In MS getting a shiny card is no difficult task, so you can't really flex with you lucky or hard-earned infinity splits.    3. It makes your collection full of useless and too colorful cards. This just doesn't look as satisfying.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm in the market for a new PC and came across a build that I'm considering. Here are the specs:    - **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X  - **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060  - **RAM**: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz  - **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD  - **Motherboard**: MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi  - **Power Supply**: 650W 80+ Bronze  - **Case**: NZXT H510    I'm planning to use it for gaming (mostly AAA titles) and some light content creation. My budget is around $1,200.     Do you think this build is good for my needs? Any suggestions for improvements or alternatives? Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been doing some research on Maca and its effects, especially in comparison to cannabinoids like THC. I find it fascinating how two substances can have such different effects on the body and mind, despite both being used for their potential health benefits.    Maca, a root vegetable native to the Andes, is often touted for its ability to boost energy, enhance mood, and improve libido. It’s considered an adaptogen, which means it may help the body adapt to stress and promote balance. Many users report increased stamina and improved mental clarity after taking Maca, which is quite different from the effects of THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis.    THC, on the other hand, is known for its euphoric effects, but it can also lead to anxiety and paranoia in some users. While THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system, primarily binding to CB1 receptors in the brain, Maca does not have a direct interaction with this system. Instead, Maca is believed to influence hormone levels and may help regulate the endocrine system, which could explain its mood-enhancing properties without the psychoactive effects associated with THC.    Interestingly, some users report that Maca can have a calming effect, which seems to be the opposite of the sometimes stimulating or anxiety-inducing effects of THC. This could be due to Maca's ability to balance hormones and support overall well-being, rather than altering perception or mood in a way that THC does.    I’m curious to hear if anyone else has experience with both Maca and cannabinoids. How do you feel they compare in terms of energy, mood, and overall cognitive function? Have you noticed any specific benefits or drawbacks when using them together or separately?
__label__1 I know this might ruffle some feathers, but I genuinely believe that hockey is the worst sport to watch on television. First off, the puck is so small and moves so fast that it’s nearly impossible to follow the action unless you’re a die-hard fan. The camera angles often don’t do justice to the game, and it can be frustrating to miss key plays because the puck is off-screen or hidden behind players.    Additionally, the constant stoppages in play for penalties, fights, and reviews can break the flow of the game, making it feel disjointed. Unlike sports like basketball or soccer, where the action is more continuous and easier to follow, hockey can feel like a series of chaotic moments that don’t always translate well to the screen.    And let’s not forget about the ice rink itself. The bright lights and the glare off the ice can make it hard to see the puck, especially for casual viewers. I get that hockey has its loyal fanbase, but for those of us who aren’t as invested, it can be a confusing and frustrating experience.     In my opinion, there are far better sports to watch on TV that offer more engaging and visually appealing experiences. I know this might not be a popular take, but I stand by it!
__label__1 I recently came across some discussions regarding the Tesla battery warranty, specifically about the Battery Management System (BMS) and its exclusion from the warranty coverage. It seems that while Tesla offers an impressive warranty on their batteries, the BMS is not included in that coverage, which has raised some concerns among owners.    For those who might not be aware, the BMS is crucial for monitoring the health and performance of the battery pack. It manages charging, discharging, and overall battery health, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. If the BMS fails, it could potentially lead to significant issues with the battery's performance and longevity.    I wanted to hear from the community:   - Have any of you experienced issues with your BMS?   - How do you feel about the exclusion of the BMS from the warranty?   - Do you think Tesla should reconsider this policy, given the importance of the BMS in battery performance?    Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!

__label__1 I've been working on my bodyweight training for a while now, and I've been focusing on perfecting my form for inverted rows and pushups. I have a few questions that I hope the community can help me with:    1. **Inverted Rows:**      - What is the ideal body angle for inverted rows? I’ve seen people do them at various angles, but I’m not sure what’s best for targeting the back effectively.     - Should I be focusing on squeezing my shoulder blades together at the top of the movement? I want to make sure I'm engaging the right muscles.     - How low should I go? Is it better to keep my body straight or allow a slight bend in the knees?    2. **Pushups:**      - I’ve been trying to keep my elbows at a 45-degree angle from my body, but I find it hard to maintain that position. Is it better to let them flare out a bit or keep them tucked in?     - What’s the best way to progress if I can do standard pushups comfortably? Should I move to decline pushups, or is there another variation you recommend?     - I’ve heard about the importance of hand placement. Should my hands be wider than shoulder-width, or is shoulder-width the best for overall strength?    I appreciate any tips or resources you can share! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 So, since starting hormones I've grown a noticeable chest (thanks progesterone!) and I am a little bit infamous in my circles for never wearing a bra. With that though, I often wear button ups and keep them mostly open. Specifically, you can almost always see the bottom crease and side of my boobs, and if I'm not careful my nipples can sometimes make an appearance too.     My best friend, also trans, had a more modest upbringing and she's happy that I feel comfortable baring so much of my chest, but she worries about how it reads to others. She's concerned that it veers too close to sexual when in public, especially if there are children here. Additionally, she feels that it reads as masculine to have so much of my chest exposed, comparing it to dudes who wear really deep v necks.     My friend truly takes no issue with my dress and will be the first to admit that she's got a tendency to be a prude, but I am genuinely curious, how does it read to have so much out there? I feel like it's no big deal but my friend disagrees, and even others have told me that it's not an issue, but it is noticeable in a way that I had no idea. I'm curious to get a trans perspective on this question.
__label__1 I've noticed a lot of discussions in this subreddit about DoorDash drivers smoking weed while on the job, and it seems to really stress some people out. I get that safety and professionalism are important, but I’m curious about why this topic seems to trigger such strong reactions.    For some, it might be about the perception of reliability. If a driver is high, they might not be as alert or focused, which could lead to mistakes like getting lost or mishandling food. Others might worry about the image of the service as a whole—if customers see drivers smoking, they might think less of DoorDash and choose not to use it.    On the flip side, I think it’s important to remember that many people can handle their cannabis use responsibly. Just like alcohol, it can be used in moderation without affecting performance. Plus, some drivers might use it to manage stress or anxiety, which could actually help them perform better.    What do you all think? Is it a valid concern, or are people overreacting? I’d love to hear different perspectives!
__label__0 Literally everything that can go wrong in my life does.   My father is abusive when im born, my mother splits up with him, he refuses to leave the house, my mum gives him her life earnings to leave, he then has a shitty flat that had the roof collapse on me.   My mother then gets a boyfriend and only when he moves in begins to be abusive just like my father and she had to pay him to leave also.   Police refuses to help in both situations.   Get bullied at school for being skinny and gay.   Get sexually harassed by a guy on a bus and then get the front of my skull cracked open by a guy at school the next day and I needed surgery.   School teachers constantly used to belittle me and make fun of me.   Go into college with all my classmates being assholes.  Get physically attacked by someone on a train for "bumping into them" when I didn't   My dad gets blinded by 6 people and proceeds to blame it all on me and then tries to make me convince me into visiting him out of pity.  Then I get into a car crash and break my ankle badly.  Then my house has a GARBAGE TRUCK drive into it.  Takes 2 years to get compensation from both the car crash and the garbage company.   My at the time girlfriend then cheats on me with a friend.   Throughout all this my mum shouts at me and calls me horrible things while treating my sister like an angle despite her being rude and unhelpful.   Most my friends talk about me behind my back and I can't seem to ever be happy.     Just fuck my life man
__label__1 As we approach the holiday season, I can't help but feel the excitement building for the Lions' upcoming games. It’s like the night before Christmas, where anticipation fills the air and anything feels possible. With the team showing promise this season, I find myself daydreaming about what it would be like to see the Lions make a deep playoff run.     Just like kids waiting for Santa, we’re all hoping for that special gift of a winning season. The energy in Detroit is palpable, and I can’t wait to see how the team performs in the next few weeks.     What are you all hoping for this holiday season? Any predictions for the rest of the season? Let’s spread some cheer and talk about what we love most about our Lions! 🦁🎄
__label__1 I recently came across a claim that has left me feeling confused and uncertain. It was about a popular health trend that suggests certain foods can significantly boost your metabolism and help with weight loss. I’ve seen various articles and social media posts promoting this idea, but I’m not sure how much of it is backed by science.     I’m looking for advice on how to discern whether something I read online is true or just a fad. What are some reliable sources I can check? How can I tell if a health claim is legitimate? Any tips on navigating the overwhelming amount of information out there would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I was at the Western Fair yesterday and noticed a group of people protesting outside the entrance. It seemed to be related to animal rights, as they were holding signs and chanting about the treatment of animals in fairs and exhibitions. I couldn't catch all the details, but it looked like they were advocating for better conditions for animals used in shows and rides.     Has anyone else seen this? What do you think about the protests? I understand the importance of animal welfare, but I also enjoy the fair experience. It’s a complex issue for sure. Would love to hear your thoughts!

Ideally, I'm looking for something in the 24-27 inch range with at least 1080p resolution, but I'm open to other options as well. If you have something available, please let me know your asking price and any details about the condition. Thanks!
__label__1 As I approach my late twenties, I often find myself pondering the question of when one truly stops being considered 'young.' Is it a specific age, like 30, when society seems to shift its perception? Or is it more about life experiences and responsibilities?     I remember when I was a teenager, I thought anyone over 25 was practically ancient! But now, I see people in their thirties and forties who still seem vibrant and youthful.     For me, I think it’s less about age and more about mindset. Some people in their fifties have a youthful spirit, while others in their twenties can seem quite mature.     What do you all think? Is there a certain age when you feel you’re no longer considered 'young'? Or is it more about how you feel and live your life?
__label__0 We're starting a new campaign with an old school DM. He's the only one in our group that has played previous additions. A player wants to multiclass armorer artificer and bladesinger wizard.     The DM has already ruled that bladesingers have to be elves, or there will be consequences in the world. Now he's ruling that the Armorer requires metal armor because the subclass states "metallurgical pursuits", and studded leather isn't enough metal. Because the bladesinger can't wear medium or heavy armor, he has essentially ruled that these two subclasses can't multiclass.     The player is arguing that the armor is magic regardless, and even the small amount of metal in studded leather should enough to meet the DM's requirement while also being light for bladesinging.     The group is split in their support.

__label__1 I was walking along the riverfront downtown today and noticed a lot of activity involving fire trucks and police boats. It seemed like there was some sort of emergency response happening, but I couldn't quite figure out what was going on.     The fire trucks were parked along the street, and I saw several firefighters getting equipment ready. Meanwhile, the police boats were patrolling the river, and it looked like they were searching for something.     I couldn't help but feel a mix of concern and curiosity. Does anyone have any information about what was happening? I hope everything is okay and that it was just a precautionary measure. It’s always a bit alarming to see such a strong emergency response in the city.     If anyone has updates or saw what was going on, please share!
__label__1 I live in a suburban neighborhood in California, and I have a neighbor who has been making increasingly aggressive threats towards me and my family. It started with verbal confrontations over minor disputes, but recently, they have escalated to direct threats of physical harm. I have tried to resolve the issues amicably, but it seems to be getting worse.    I’m concerned for my safety and the safety of my family. I have documented the incidents, including dates, times, and what was said, and I have also recorded some of the interactions on my phone.     What steps should I take to protect myself legally? Should I file a police report, or is there a different legal action I should consider? I want to ensure that I handle this situation appropriately and protect my rights. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 When it comes to the Dark Souls series, opinions on which game is the best can vary widely among fans, but I’d argue that Dark Souls III stands out as the pinnacle of gameplay experience. Here’s why:    1. **Refined Combat Mechanics**: Dark Souls III takes the combat mechanics from its predecessors and polishes them to near perfection. The addition of the weapon arts system allows for more diverse combat strategies, giving players unique moves that can turn the tide of battle. The fluidity of the combat feels more responsive, making each encounter feel intense and rewarding.    2. **Stunning Visuals and Atmosphere**: The game is visually stunning, with beautifully designed environments that are both haunting and captivating. From the gothic architecture of Lothric Castle to the eerie beauty of the Untended Graves, each area is meticulously crafted, enhancing the overall atmosphere that the series is known for.    3. **Tight Level Design**: Dark Souls III features some of the best level design in the series. The interconnected world feels cohesive, with shortcuts and hidden paths that reward exploration. Each area flows into the next seamlessly, making the journey feel like a grand adventure rather than a series of disconnected levels.    4. **Challenging Yet Fair**: The difficulty in Dark Souls III is a hallmark of the series, but it strikes a balance between challenge and fairness. Boss fights are memorable and require players to learn patterns and adapt strategies, but they never feel insurmountable. The sense of achievement after defeating a tough boss is incredibly satisfying.    5. **Rich Lore and Storytelling**: While the story is often told through item descriptions and environmental storytelling, Dark Souls III ties together many threads from previous games, providing a sense of closure for long-time fans. The lore is deep and engaging, encouraging players to piece together the narrative as they progress.    6. **Multiplayer Elements**: The multiplayer aspects, including co-op and invasions, are well-integrated into the gameplay. The ability to summon friends for tough bosses or engage in PvP adds a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the experience.    In conclusion, while each Dark Souls game has its own merits, Dark Souls III combines refined gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and rich lore to create an unforgettable experience. It’s a game that not only challenges players but also rewards them with a sense of accomplishment and immersion in its dark, beautiful world.

__label__1 I'm relatively new to the world of bondage and I'm looking for some tips and references to help me get started safely and effectively. I want to explore this aspect of BDSM with my partner, but I want to make sure we approach it with care and respect for each other's boundaries.    Here are a few specific areas where I could use some guidance:    1. **Safety First**: What are the essential safety precautions I should take when practicing bondage? Are there specific tools or equipment that are safer than others?    2. **Types of Bondage**: I’ve heard about different styles like rope bondage, cuffs, and even more elaborate setups. What are some beginner-friendly techniques or styles that you recommend?    3. **Communication**: How do I ensure that my partner and I are on the same page about our limits and desires? What are some effective ways to discuss boundaries before we start?    4. **Resources**: Are there any books, websites, or videos that you would recommend for someone just starting out? I’m looking for both instructional content and also material that covers the psychological aspects of bondage.    5. **Aftercare**: What should I keep in mind for aftercare once the bondage session is over? How can I make sure my partner feels safe and cared for afterward?    I appreciate any advice or resources you can share! Thank you!
__label__0   I am not usually the jealous type, when I am with someone I put my trust in them and hope they fulfill it. I woke up to a call on my girlfriends phone at 3 am. She lives across the country for the summer, so Initially I got worried because she never calls me that late. I was about to hang up when I heard multiple men talking in the background along with her and one of her female friends. Nothing happened within the call besides a bunch of voices that I’ve never heard before. It just made me super uneasy. I waited around 2 hours and asked her what she was up to. She responded she was trying to get a ride home. She told me earlier that she was going out with her friends, which i was totally cool with and told her to have fun. She never mentioned anything about these strangers that she was hanging out with. I called her and told her I was uncomfortable with the situation and I felt it pushed my boundaries a bit. We’ve talked about this before she’s told me that she would be uncomfortable if I did something along these lines. She kept apologizing for making me feel that way and insecure, but it felt really back handed. I don’t think she cheated, but I felt very disrespected. Come to find out she was also driving another male friend to the bar to meet with her girlfriend that she doesn’t even really like. All that together made me break up with her. I just feel my boundaries were stepped on, and she never mentioned any of these male associates would be involved in partying that night. It is hard for me to think I’m being insecure because I really love myself. I am also not afraid to be single again. She wants to talk about later today again.      What do you guys think I should do?

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm new to the YouTube community and have been experimenting with creating Shorts. I love the format, but I have a specific question. Is there a way to upload Shorts without them being visible to my subscribers?

If anyone has tips or knows of any settings I can adjust to achieve this, I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!

I set up the xbox one, added my xbox/microsoft account and tried to link up with my friends, but it seems to keep telling me games are unavailable &amp; also tells me im not in the same gen pool as if im still using my series S even though im not. I've looked everywhere &amp; can't find a fix, please help, thanks in advance.
__label__1 I recently purchased a Razer Blade 15 with an Nvidia 2060, and I've been diving into the world of Linux, specifically Arch. However, I came across some information on the Arch wiki that suggests the Blade series has a pretty rough reputation when it comes to Linux compatibility.     I'm curious if anyone here has experience using a Razer Blade 15 on Linux. How has your experience been? Are there specific issues I should be aware of, particularly with the Nvidia drivers, battery life, or hardware support?     I've heard mixed reviews about the touchpad and keyboard functionality as well. Any tips or workarounds would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I just found out that I've been shadow banned from Warzone, and honestly, I'm at a loss for words. I haven't done anything against the rules, no cheating, no exploiting glitches, just playing the game like everyone else.     I logged in today, and I noticed my matches were filled with players who were clearly way above my skill level. After some digging, I realized that I was shadow banned. I’ve seen some posts about this happening to others, but I never thought it would happen to me.     Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to resolve it? I’ve tried reaching out to Activision support, but it feels like I’m just talking to a wall. I really enjoy this game, and it’s frustrating to be locked out for something I didn’t do. Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated!

__label__0 Hey everyone,     &amp;#x200B;    I've read quite a few posts but none seem similar to my situation, so I'd like to explain mine and see what responses I get.     &amp;#x200B;    Male, 283 lbs, 5'9     &amp;#x200B;    I need to drop more than 100 lbs. I recently got diagnosed with low Testosterone, so I've been getting the 200mg every 2 weeks injections. I also started working out with a pro body builder for personal training 4 times a week, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours (it's pretty intense). I started a little over 3 weeks ago, and this coming Monday will be my 4th finished week of training. So far, I've lost 12 lbs from starting at 296 lbs. However, that weight was lost by the end of the 2nd week. I've lost nothing during the 3rd week, nor up-to today. Weigh ins are on Monday. I am not cheating on my diet, and I am getting meal prep. Diet is:     (Everything is cooked in 0 cal nonstick spray)    Breakfast:    1 piece toast (100 cal)    1 tsp low cal butter (15 cal)     2 large eggs (140 calories)    3 Turkey Bacon (120 cal)     Lunch:     8 oz chicken breast (240 cal)     1 cup brown rice (150)    mixed veggies (20 cal)    Dinner:     1 cup brown rice (150 cal)    8oz ground turkey (320 cal)    mixed veggies (20 cal)    Snack:     Premier Protean Shake Chocolate (160 cal)    Total: 1,435 calories     &amp;#x200B;    I eat like a dog, I eat this every day. Absolutely no other snacks, I drink water and green tea. How is it possible that I haven't lost anymore weight? Could it be that the TRT and weight lifting is causing gains that outweigh the fat loss? Or any ideas? Kinda going nuts here.     &amp;#x200B;    For the record, I know people say calories add up in ways we don't expect such as coffee creamer, oils, everything. I assure you, I am well aware and not adding extra calories in any way. That is why this is so frustrating. I really am giving 110% and just not seeing the results, so it is very discouraging.
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about how Survivor has evolved over the years, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s time for a back to basics season. The early seasons had such a raw and authentic feel, with players relying on their survival skills and social dynamics without the added twists and advantages that have become commonplace in recent seasons.    Imagine a season where the focus is solely on the core elements of the game: survival, strategy, and social interaction. No hidden immunity idols, no advantages in the game, just pure Survivor. It would be fascinating to see how players adapt to the challenges without the crutches of modern gameplay.     I think it would also bring back some of the nostalgia for long-time fans who fell in love with the show in its early days. Plus, it could be interesting to see how new players, who are used to the current format, would handle a more stripped-down version of the game.     What do you all think? Would you be excited for a back to basics season, or do you prefer the twists and turns that have become a staple of Survivor? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 {Netflix location = Netherlands}    Today (4th of September) Rick and Morty season six is set to launch, I watched all the previous seasons a couple weeks ago and they were still on Netflix, but when I tried looking for season six i couldn't even find any trace of the new or old seasons on Netflix. I couldn't find anything on the internet stating that Rock and Morty will be removed from Netflix either.  Is this just me or is there something i don't know of?    Edit: don't know if this is 100% true but scrolling through the Rick and Morty subreddit i found some redditors saying that Netflix lost the rights to season 1-5 but still managed to aquire the right to season 6 (this probably changes alot depending on the country)

__label__0 I’ve 29f just done a blood test and received my test results. I’ve got super high testosterone (2.03nmol/l) and SHGB (197nmol/l). Any ideas what I can do to bring these down?    From my research, it seems like it’s unusual to have both of these being so high.     I am vegan, mostly gluten avoidant, I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t smoke, I don’t have caffeine, I eat lots of vegetables, and a fair amount of fruit. I also don’t take contraceptives.     What does it mean for me? Could this be linked to a low level of Omega-3 (4.05%)? Should I be concerned?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I recently picked up a trailer that needs some welding work done, and I'm trying to get a better idea of how long it might take and what the costs could look like. The trailer has some rusted areas that need to be reinforced, and I also want to add a few modifications to it for better functionality.    From what I can see, it looks like I’ll need to do some patchwork on the frame and possibly replace a couple of cross members. I’m not sure if I should tackle this myself or hire a professional.     For those of you who have experience with similar projects, how many hours do you think it would take to complete the welding work? Also, if I were to hire someone, what would be a rough estimate for the cost of labor and materials in the USA?     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__0 I (17m) have been arguing with my mom (49F) about college. I wanna go to Tulane University because all my friends are going, but my mom wants me to go to the local Community College since I'm an average C student and she wants to monitor my grades. Now, I have a pretty big problem with this, and I'd be lying if I said i wasn't offended. I mean, I'm a full grown adult, I don't need a babysitter! Now, my mom hates jazz because she lost her older sister in a car accident (might have been one of my friends but probably not) so as my own little revenge for my mom not letting me go to the cool university, I have been blasting jazz 24/7. My gf (17f) been saying she's gonna break up with me if i don't "fix my attitude and be more compassionate" (probably that time of the month) but my friends say it's cool tho, so AITA?

__label__1 I recently finished playing Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, and I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the experience. As a long-time fan of the Sherlock Holmes series, I had high hopes for this game, especially with the promise of an open-world environment and a fresh take on the iconic detective's early years.    First off, the story felt disjointed and lacked the depth I was expecting. While the premise of exploring Sherlock's past and his relationship with his mother was intriguing, the execution fell flat. The narrative often felt rushed, and some plot points seemed to come out of nowhere, leaving me confused rather than engaged. I found myself losing interest in the main storyline, which is a big letdown for a game that relies heavily on narrative.    The gameplay mechanics also left much to be desired. The detective work, which should be the highlight of the game, felt overly simplified. The clues were often too obvious, and the deduction mechanics didn’t provide the satisfying challenge I was hoping for. I remember the thrill of piecing together clues in previous titles, but here it felt more like a chore than an engaging puzzle.    Visually, the game has its moments, but the optimization issues were hard to ignore. I experienced several bugs and performance drops, which detracted from the overall immersion. It’s frustrating to be pulled out of the experience because of technical problems, especially in a game that aims to create a rich, atmospheric world.    I really wanted to love Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but it just didn’t live up to my expectations. I think I’ll be waiting a while before diving into another game in the series. For those who are patient gamers like me, maybe it’s worth waiting for a sale or some patches to address the issues before giving it a try.

__label__1 I've been reading a lot about sun protection lately, and I keep coming across the advice that we should wear sunscreen even when we're indoors. I wanted to get the community's thoughts on this.     I understand that UV rays can penetrate windows, especially UVA rays, which are linked to skin aging and some types of skin cancer. However, I often find myself indoors for most of the day, and I’m not sure if applying sunscreen is necessary in that case.     For those of you who wear sunscreen indoors, do you have a specific product you prefer? Do you think it makes a noticeable difference in your skin's health? Also, how do you incorporate it into your routine if you’re already using other skincare products?     I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips you might have!

__label__1 If you're looking to get a discount on your DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse) purchases, here's a little tip that might help you out.     Instead of signing up for their rewards program with your real information, consider using a fake name and a temporary email address. This way, you can still receive the discount codes and promotions without having to deal with spam in your main inbox.     When you make a purchase, just use the fake name for the rewards account. If you ever need to return or exchange shoes, just keep the receipt and use the same fake name.     This method allows you to take advantage of the discounts without committing to their marketing emails or giving away your personal information. Just remember to keep track of the fake email and any passwords you use, so you can access the account when needed. Happy shopping!
__label__1 Today was a huge milestone for me, and I just had to share it with you all! I was out running some errands, and while I was waiting in line at the grocery store, a random stranger smiled at me and said, "Excuse me, miss, do you know where the dairy section is?"      I was completely taken aback! I couldn't believe it. I felt a rush of joy and validation. It was the first time someone referred to me as "miss" without me having to say anything or correct them. I’ve been on my journey for a while now, and moments like this make all the struggles worth it.      I know that passing can be a sensitive topic for many, and it’s not the only measure of our identities, but for me, it felt like a step forward in my transition. I just wanted to share this little victory with you all because I know you’ll understand how meaningful it is.      Have any of you had similar experiences? I’d love to hear your stories!

Also, are there specific focuses or decisions that can help mitigate the risk of foreign intervention? Any tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

I tried reaching out to the administration, but all I got was a generic response about "maintaining facilities" and "future access." Future access? When? At this point, I feel like I'm just throwing money into a black hole.     Anyone else in the same boat? What are you doing about it? I'm seriously considering starting a petition or something.

__label__0 Non-native English speaker here.     In today's world exile is not considered that much of a big deal even by exilees themselves. Lots of people are exiled from their homeland and they live even better lives abroad.     Compare that to exile throughout history. It was considered a terrible fate to befall one. Exiled Romans and Greeks lamented on their exile so did exiles in other time and place in history.     Sure during prehistoric times it was terrible since getting exiled from a tribe meant certain death. But throughout written history where humankind lived in state societies, exile seems to have been a terrible fate even though in modern times its not considered such a big deal.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just finished creating some wallpapers inspired by my latest Fortnite Creative project, Projekt Delta. I wanted to share them with you all!     These wallpapers feature some of the key locations and themes from the map, and I think they really capture the vibe I was going for. I’ve included a few different styles, so hopefully there’s something for everyone.     Feel free to use them as your background or share your thoughts! I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions for future designs.     Here are the links to download:  1. [Wallpaper 1 - Cityscape](#)  2. [Wallpaper 2 - Nighttime](#)  3. [Wallpaper 3 - Battle Scene](#)    Thanks for checking them out! Looking forward to seeing what you all think!
__label__1 I am reaching out to the wonderful community here on GoFundMe to ask for your support in improving my small blacksmithing business. As a passionate blacksmith, I have dedicated countless hours to honing my craft and creating unique, handcrafted items. However, to take my business to the next level, I need a crucial piece of equipment: a power hammer.    Currently, I am working with traditional hand tools, which limits my production capacity and the complexity of the projects I can undertake. A power hammer would not only increase my efficiency but also allow me to create more intricate designs and larger pieces that I have always dreamed of making. This investment would significantly enhance the quality of my work and help me meet the growing demand from my customers.    Unfortunately, the cost of a good power hammer is beyond my current financial means. I have been saving up, but with the rising costs of materials and living expenses, it has been challenging to set aside enough funds. That’s why I am turning to you for help.     Your contributions will go directly towards purchasing a power hammer, which will enable me to expand my business, create more jobs, and continue to share my passion for blacksmithing with the community. Every little bit helps, and I am incredibly grateful for any support you can provide.    Thank you for taking the time to read my story. If you can’t contribute financially, sharing this campaign with your friends and family would mean the world to me. Together, we can forge a brighter future for my business!
__label__1 I recently came across a problem involving the Fibonacci sequence and I wanted to share my findings and get some insights from the community. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:    - F(0) = 0  - F(1) = 1  - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1    I was curious about the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, specifically the limit of the ratio F(n+1)/F(n) as n approaches infinity. After some calculations, I found that this limit converges to the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.6180339887.    To derive this, I set up the equation:    \[ L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)} \]    Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, we can express this as:    \[ L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F(n) + F(n-1)}{F(n)} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{F(n-1)}{F(n)} \right) \]      As n approaches infinity, the term \( \frac{F(n-1)}{F(n)} \) approaches \( \frac{1}{L} \). This gives us the equation:    \[ L = 1 + \frac{1}{L} \]      Multiplying both sides by L leads to:    \[ L^2 = L + 1 \]      Rearranging gives us the quadratic equation:    \[ L^2 - L - 1 = 0 \]      Using the quadratic formula, we find:    \[ L = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]      Since L must be positive, we take the positive root, which is the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).    I find it fascinating how this simple recursive sequence leads to such a profound mathematical constant. Has anyone else explored the connections between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio? I would love to hear your thoughts or any additional insights!
__label__0 Planning to buy all the parts for my first ever pc from them since they're all in stock anyway except for the GPU. Was wondering if it is easy to just install the GPU on my own once I buy from a diff shop and just have PCHub assemble the rest of my parts? And how are their after sales service as well as assembly service?    For those wondering why not just assemble it myself, I could but I sadly don't have enough time to go through Youtube vids and read tutorials :( I'm working onsite now plus my upcoming weekends are spent away from home.     Much appreciated to whoever replies, thanks!
__label__1 I recently purchased a new Ledger hardware wallet and I'm trying to connect it to my existing MetaMask account that I've been using for a while. I want to ensure that I can access my Ethereum and tokens safely through the Ledger.    I followed the steps to set up the Ledger and installed the Ethereum app on it. However, I'm a bit confused about how to connect my old MetaMask wallet to the new Ledger. Do I need to import my old wallet into the Ledger, or can I simply connect the Ledger to MetaMask and access my existing assets?    Also, are there any specific settings or configurations I should be aware of when using Ledger with MetaMask? I want to make sure I do everything correctly to avoid any potential loss of funds.    Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__0 It used to be near the bottom of the videos and now it just isn’t there. I’m not sure if it disappeared when I upgraded or some time after. I usually use my system volume so I don’t always pay attention to where it is in apps but I know YouTube used to have one. Right now my system volume is at Max and YouTube is barely audible. Like the sound is there but it’s so low it’s probably only a degree above being fully muted. There’s an option I can click for “listening controls” but this does not include volume either. Help?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 29-year-old guy looking to connect with new and interesting people online. I love chatting about a variety of topics, from movies and music to gaming and travel. I enjoy sharing memes, discussing the latest shows, and even diving into some deep philosophical conversations when the mood strikes.     I'm hoping to find friends who are open-minded, fun, and maybe even a little quirky! If you're into gaming, I play a bit of everything, but I'm currently hooked on RPGs and indie games. I also love to binge-watch series on Netflix and am always looking for recommendations.     Feel free to drop a comment or send me a message if you're interested in chatting! Let's share some laughs and see where our conversations take us!
__label__0 Alright. In 1997 my father went to visit his family in Greece and during that trip my grandmother transferred (by notarized deed) a parcel of land in Santorini to my father &amp; his two brothers. My father then returned to Canada and and left his brothers in charge of going to the village in Santorini to 1) get the land cleared by a lawyer, 2) register the deed in the land registry and 3) pay the property taxes. His two brothers did get the land cleared and the property was registered under all three of their names and the deed registration was given a serial number. However they did not pay the taxes.     Fast forward to 2006, my father gets a phone call from his brothers informing him that archeological artifacts were found on the land and the government has repossessed it. They told him nothing can be done. My father did not question his brothers and closed the matter.     In 2009, one of my father’s sisters Mrs. R. somehow managed to get my grandmother to sign over the property to her by another notarized deed. Mrs. R then went down to the land registry in Santorini and hired a lawyer to get the property cleared and register the deed under her name, but failed. (We do not know why she could not do it, and we think it is because of the claim that was already registered by my father and his two brothers back in 1997).     In or around 2019-2020-2021 my father’s second sister Mrs. E. somehow managed to get a lawyer to clear the land and registered the property under her two sons (my father’s nephews).     My father just found out about all of this, as last he heard, the property was repossessed by the government after they found archeological artifacts. When questioning his two brothers and two sisters, they act aloof and keep repeating that the land is worth very little (about 3 000 euros for 900 sq. meters of land). *however Mrs. R. let it slip that she paid a lawyer 9 000 euros to try and register it under her name back in 2009…*    The siblings are also stating that they do not have any of the paperwork regarding the second deed that was drafted in 2009, nor any of the subsequent registrations (first attempt in 2009 &amp; second somehow successful attempt in or around 2019 to 2021).     I need to know what legal actions my father can take to claim back his portion of the land back! The entire thing is completely shady on his siblings side and it will break my dads heart when he truly realizes that they screwed him over (which sadly they did)..
__label__0 I am looking for an educational science show I watched in the Midwest during middle school (2005-2007]. The show could have been several years older than that because I believe they were on VHS. Each episode of the show was focused on a different scientific topic, and it featured live actors as hosts who would walk through a lesson. The segments were interspersed with animations or nature footage. There also were segments with a character named “B-Louie” (or similar; he was a blue sphere with a face) and he’d ask quiz questions.
__label__0 So I’m always sending my gf random (and mostly silly) memes. Sometimes while I’m on a call today. So I recently came across a meme that said ‘Someone’s gf is a squirter and he doesn’t know but some other guy knows.’ When I sent it to her she laughed and asked why I’m always sending crazy memes. I then decided to ask her if she’s a squirter. She said she would tell me when I met her (I had called to ask if I could pass by to visit). Should i follow up on this? She’s had 2 partners before me. Our sex life is great according to her and so far there’s nothing she would change (of course she’d say that but I do believe her to some degree). I’m curious if I’m satisfying her as well I could. Okay hat if she can squirt but I just haven’t managed to bring it out of her?
__label__0 A short film inspired by the god of iron in Yoruba mythology called Ogun.

__label__1 I've been considering switching to Pop!_OS and wanted to know what the hardware requirements are. I have an older laptop and I'm not sure if it will run smoothly.     From what I've gathered, here are the general requirements:    - **Processor**: 64-bit processor (Intel or AMD)  - **RAM**: Minimum of 4 GB (8 GB or more recommended for better performance)  - **Storage**: At least 20 GB of free disk space (SSD recommended for faster performance)  - **Graphics**: A graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.5 or higher (NVIDIA or AMD recommended for better compatibility)    Are there any specific hardware configurations or components that work particularly well with Pop!_OS? Also, if anyone has experience running it on older hardware, I’d love to hear how it performed! Thanks!
__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but I genuinely believe that the old Weekly Idol hosts, Jung Hyung Don and Defconn, were way better than the current ones. Their chemistry was unmatched, and they had a unique way of making idols feel comfortable while also pushing them to be entertaining. The humor they brought to the show was so natural and spontaneous, which made the episodes feel more genuine and fun.    The new hosts just don't have the same energy or comedic timing. It feels like they're trying too hard to replicate the old format without capturing the essence that made the show a hit in the first place. I miss the iconic segments and the way the old hosts interacted with the idols, creating memorable moments that fans still talk about today.     What do you all think? Am I alone in this opinion?

__label__0 I 14f have constant arguments over this thing with my parents . They say if I am brave enough and have the will power then I can just snap out if depression.  i have tride to explain that that's not how depression works.

They tell me to do yoga pray and listen to a motivational video and snap out of depression but that's not how it works and they don't understand,sometimes I feel  they don't WANT to understand.   So how do i explain  to them that you can't just "motivate " Yourself out of depression
__label__0 Hey all.      Currently in the market for a new fun car.  Looking for something in the (max) $80-$100k range. I know this is a strange time to be in the market for a vehicle with crazy high dealer markups and whatnot, but willing to wait it out a little longer if I need to.  FWIW, I am also planning on custom ordering (I know Ford allows this as long as local dealership is on board, not 100% sure about BMW).      Basically, the gist of my questions come from the maintenance side of things and driver experiences.  Having owned and driven a lot in my 2012 Porsche 911 Cabriolet, I know maintenance is the sleeper cost factor when it comes to some of these nicer vehicles.  Just wondering how BMW's fare in this way, as well as Shelbys.  Any advice or knowledge / pointers are appreciated!  Also, any tips for custom ordering would be great.    Also, personal experiences with either of the vehicles listed would be awesome too!  It's very hard to find test-driveable models in my area, as there is an obvious shortage of inventory.      My current fallback plan if these cars don't pan out is a Model 3 performance, love the idea of quick ordering online with a few clicks, but I would really like to enjoy a few more years of engine noise before the market shifts more EV heavy.      P.S. ... Reasons for liking the Shelby GT500: V8 sound / feel, American muscle car, never owned a muscle car before.  Reasons for liking the M4: feels like a slightly better commuter friendly vehicle, wife would probably enjoy driving it to work occasionally, interior is *so* much nicer and more luxurious, with similar performance stats to the GT500.     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been playing through the latest Pokémon games, and I can't help but notice how some of the new legendary designs remind me of Spectrobes! For those who don't know, Spectrobes was a game where you could dig up and awaken ancient creatures to battle with, and the designs were often very unique and otherworldly.     Take the new legendary Pokémon, for example. Their sleek, alien-like features and vibrant colors really evoke that same sense of wonder and adventure that Spectrobes had. I remember spending hours digging and battling in that game, and seeing these new legendaries brought back those nostalgic feelings.     Does anyone else see the resemblance? Or maybe you have a favorite legendary that you think fits this comparison? Let’s discuss!     Also, if you haven't played Spectrobes, I highly recommend checking it out! It’s a fun game that deserves more love in the gaming community.
__label__1 I've been dealing with gastroparesis for a while now, and one of the most frustrating aspects of it has been my complete inability to vomit. I know that for many people with GP, vomiting is a common symptom, but for me, it seems like my body has just lost that ability altogether.     I can feel the nausea building up, and I often wish I could just get it out, but it never happens. It's such a strange feeling to be so nauseous and not have any relief. I’ve tried various remedies and medications, but nothing seems to help with the nausea, and the pressure just builds up.     I’m curious if there are others out there who have experienced the same thing. How do you cope with the nausea when you can’t vomit? Are there any strategies or tips that have worked for you? I feel a bit isolated in this experience, and it would be nice to connect with others who understand what I’m going through.
__label__0 Homebrew is a preference but modules work too as Ian is learning! Please private message me (Eryn) to talk. We can be semi-flexible with the time/day but Saturday, Thursday, and anytime after 7pm start time will not work.          \--Hey I'm Eryn (22F, she/her), I've been playing dnd for about 3 years as both a player and DM. I mostly enjoy druids and what I really enjoy the most out of dnd is building meaningful connections between the players through roleplay. Outside of dnd, I'm a college student studying geology and I play a lot of PC games like destiny 2. Also, I have 3 of my friends looking to join the group with me; I've included their descriptions below.    &amp;#x200B;    \--It’s always hard to describe yourself. I'm Dalton, I’m 28 (he/him), and I’ve also been playing for a similar amount of time as Eryn. I enjoy the spontaneity of the game and value levity, as well as drama. I also appreciate a finely-tuned combat encounter, but a wild mess can be just as fun, at times. I’m an amateur streamer outside of dnd and my schedule should be somewhat flexible.    &amp;#x200B;    \--My name is Xavier and I am 20 years old. I have been playing D&amp;D online for around five years now. I love playing wizards.    &amp;#x200B;    \--Hi, my name is Ian 28M, I've never officially played DnD either as a player or a DM. Most I've done is sat in on a few sessions with past friends groups and watched/ listened. From the research and navigating classes from help from my partner in most interested in a Fighter-Samurai. What I think I'll enjoy in DnD is the little moments that are filled with laughter and confusion when random things happen that no one could've predicted. Outside of DnD I work on a flightline, helping coordinate maintenance with others to keep aircraft updated and fly worthy. I play allot of PC games like D2, rocket league, escape from tarkov and many others.

__label__1 I don’t know how to start this, but I feel like I need to get it off my chest. Not a day goes by where thoughts of homicide or suicide don’t cross my mind. I know it sounds dark, and I’m not proud of it, but it’s the truth.     I often find myself daydreaming about scenarios where I could take control of my life in a way that feels powerful, even if it’s in a destructive manner. I think about what it would be like to end my own suffering or to take out my frustrations on someone who has wronged me. It’s not that I want to act on these thoughts; I just can’t help but think about them.     I’ve been struggling with depression for years, and it feels like I’m stuck in a cycle of negativity. I try to distract myself with hobbies, work, and friends, but the thoughts always creep back in. I feel like I’m constantly battling with my mind, and it’s exhausting.     I know I need help, but I’m scared to reach out. I don’t want to burden anyone with my darkness, and I fear that people won’t understand. I guess I’m just hoping that by sharing this here, I can find some solace in knowing that I’m not alone in feeling this way.     If anyone has been through something similar or has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I just want to find a way to quiet these thoughts and find some peace.
__label__0 It’s time to retire the old conshelf. I figure using a regulator as old as I am is no longer a viable option. Especially considering I have found myself venturing down the technical certification tree.     So, I am in the market for a pair of first stages to complete my twinsets. (Likely side mount as well this winter)    My diving instructor swears by Dive Rite, and considering my experience with everything Dive Rite I own and use, I am inclined to agree.     Still, It’s a lot of cash to drop without at least considering the other options out there.     Are there any regulators out there that are maybe a little less known, or underrated? Budget is a little tighter than I anticipated for some upcoming certifications, and if there are viable alternatives I am not aware of I would very much appreciate a heads up.      For some background, I mostly dive in Florida, dive wreck and will be going for cave cert in the fall.     Thanks!
__label__0 So, I’d like to start off with clarifying that I am a new player, having only started weekend before last, and I have not even completed the main story yet. I’ve mainly tried to get through BBI as fast as possible, and right now I’m trying to get Cursed Light to help me out. The thing is, I never get it. I’ve only gotten Purged Buckler. I even get different weapons whenever I’m a magic-based class, but never with fighter. I often save before changing me and my pawns vocations to fighter and warrior, but it’s always just purged buckler. What am I doing wrong?
__label__1 I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks now, and we seem to have a good connection. We text regularly, and he’s initiated conversations most of the time. However, there have been a couple of days where he hasn’t reached out, and I’m starting to wonder if I should be concerned or if it’s just normal behavior.     I know that guys can sometimes be less communicative or may not feel the need to text every day, but I’m curious about how often men typically text someone they’re interested in.     What do you think? If he’s interested, what’s the likelihood he’ll text me again? Should I reach out first, or is it better to wait and see if he initiates? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

__label__1 I recently started using Cainiao Super Economy Global for my orders from Aliexpress, and I wanted to share my experience and get some feedback from others about its reliability.     So far, I've had a mixed experience. On one hand, the shipping times have been relatively reasonable compared to other shipping options, especially considering the low cost. My first order took about 3 weeks to arrive, which I thought was acceptable given that it was shipped from China. However, I’ve also heard stories from other users about packages getting lost or taking much longer than expected, sometimes even over a month.     Tracking can be a bit hit or miss as well. Sometimes the tracking information is updated regularly, but other times it seems to stall for days or even weeks, which can be frustrating.     I’m curious to know how others have fared with Cainiao Super Economy Global. Have you had reliable deliveries, or have you faced issues? Is it worth sticking with this shipping method, or should I consider other options for future orders?     Thanks in advance for your insights!

__label__0 rules: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/y17mwk/rules\_for\_the\_cellar/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/y17mwk/rules_for_the_cellar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)    Michael bought a cheap house, since he was in his young age and didn't have any grand income yet. it was not a bad house, it was well preserved and very fine for this price. it should probably have cost five times the price that he is paying. of course, he haven't bought the house, he is only renting it. for some reason the owner don't want to sell it. anyways, Michael have moved in and is going to spend his first night in it. the owner have given him a list of rules relating to the basement of this house, Michael will read through it later, it is probably not that important right now.    Michael goes through the entire day, packing up his things and putting them in the places that he thinks they will fit. after he is done with all that, de decides that he deserves a pizza, so he orders one to be delivered to his address. once the pizza arrives he sits down on his couch, eating pizza and watching Netflix. after a while he looks out the window, it is already dark, time went by fast.    Michael stands up and goes of the couch, he goes out to wash the knife he used to slice his pizza with. as he turns on the water, oddly, it is black and thick, it does not look like water at all. is there something wrong with the sewage? he decides to let it be and go to bed. as he lays down in bed, the light starts to flicker and eventually it all turns black. Michael simply sleeps through the dark for the night.    the day after he walks by the basement door, and he hears a voice down in the basement. which is odd there should be no-one in the house, and he locked the door yesterday. the voice says: help me, I am stuck. Michael can hear how defenceless and in need this voice is. so his instincts is to open the door. as he does so, he is instantly meet with a wall made of spider silk.    anyways, he tears through the webbing and starts to decent down into the basement. the stairs are made out of wood and seems kind of old, it dose not match the rest of the house. the stairs makes creaking noises as he walks down them. as he reaches the basement floor, he walks around and looks for the person who cried out for him. he doesn't see anything at first, but after a while he sees a silhouette of a person. but as he gets closer he sees that it has a tail and pointy ears, like a fox. and then the voice coming from the fox says: finally, you have arrived.    Michael starts running towards the basement door, as he intent to shut that thing in, down here in the basement. he runs towards the door, as he looks back he sees the creature walking towards him. but something is of, beside this creature. no matter how much effort Michael puts into running towards the basement door, it seems like it is getting further away from him rather than closer to him. is he going insane, is he hallucinating and running the wrong way? eventually the door disappears entirely and everything turns dark. he can only hear something getting closer behind him. eventually he feels two paws, with outstretched claws digging into his stomach.    later on, in the basement two people stand, looking at half a corpse. one of them says: this one didn't last for long. he must not have read the rules.
__label__1 I've been looking to upgrade my RAM and I currently have 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX (2x8GB) running at 3200MHz. I found a good deal on a 16GB kit of G.Skill Ripjaws V (2x8GB) also at 3200MHz. My question is, should I mix these two different brands together in my build?     I've heard mixed opinions on this topic. Some say it's fine as long as the speeds and timings are similar, while others recommend sticking to the same brand and model for optimal compatibility and performance.     If I do decide to mix them, what should I be aware of? Will I need to adjust any settings in the BIOS? And is there a chance that it could lead to stability issues?     Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 When discussing Rob Zombie's Halloween films, many fans often overlook the unique approach he took in reimagining the franchise. Here are a few key aspects that deserve more recognition:    1. **Character Depth**: Zombie's films delve deeper into Michael Myers' backstory than any previous installment. By exploring his childhood and the psychological factors that contributed to his transformation into a killer, Zombie adds layers to a character that was previously more of a faceless monster. This backstory allows viewers to understand, if not sympathize with, Michael in a way that’s rarely been done in slasher films.    2. **Realism and Grit**: Zombie's vision brings a raw, gritty realism to the horror genre. The violence is brutal and unflinching, which can be jarring but also serves to heighten the stakes. This approach contrasts sharply with the more stylized violence of earlier films, making the horror feel more immediate and impactful.    3. **Strong Female Characters**: While Laurie Strode is iconic, Zombie's films introduce strong female characters who are not just victims. Characters like Annie and Brackett's portrayal of Laurie show resilience and complexity, which adds depth to the narrative. They are not merely there to be saved; they fight back and have their own arcs.    4. **Soundtrack and Atmosphere**: Zombie's use of music and sound design creates a distinct atmosphere that sets his films apart. The soundtrack, often featuring classic rock and heavy metal, adds a unique flavor that enhances the emotional weight of the scenes. The overall aesthetic is darker and more atmospheric, which aligns well with the themes of his films.    5. **A Different Take on Horror**: Zombie's Halloween is not just about the scares; it’s a commentary on violence, family dysfunction, and the cycle of abuse. This thematic depth invites viewers to engage with the material on a more intellectual level, prompting discussions about the nature of evil and the impact of upbringing on behavior.    In conclusion, while Rob Zombie's Halloween films may not be everyone's cup of tea, they offer a fresh perspective on a beloved franchise. By focusing on character development, realism, and thematic depth, Zombie has created a version of Halloween that stands apart from its predecessors and deserves appreciation for its bold choices.
__label__0 living with a mind like that can be very exhausting. i often have negative thoughts about myself, my life, my past, my relationship. i feel like my mind creates problems that aren’t actually there. it creates insecurities for me and there are days that i feel awful and like i am not good enough in any aspect. i get in my thoughts and my mood changes and it causes arguments with people around me. i am tired to be anxious most of the time.

__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently launched a podcast dedicated to the world of professional wrestling and the unique lifestyle that comes with it. Each episode features interviews with current and former wrestlers, discussions about the behind-the-scenes aspects of the industry, and insights into the challenges and triumphs they face both in and out of the ring.    We dive deep into their personal stories, training regimens, and the mental and physical demands of being a pro wrestler. Whether you're a lifelong fan or just curious about what goes on behind the curtain, I think you'll find something to enjoy!    I’d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think. Your feedback would mean a lot to me as I continue to develop the show. Thanks for your support!

__label__1 Hey everyone!     As we gear up for the Spring semester, I wanted to reach out to help our incoming exchange students find accommodation. I know how challenging it can be to secure a place to live, especially if you're coming from another country.     If you have any leads on available apartments, rooms for rent, or even if you're looking for a roommate to share a place with, please share your information here!     Additionally, if you have any tips on the best neighborhoods to live in or resources for finding housing, that would be super helpful too. Let's make sure our new Buckeyes feel welcome and have a smooth transition!     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I feel like I’m in a never-ending spiral of stress and sadness. Every day seems to bring a new challenge, and I’m struggling to keep my head above water. Work is overwhelming, my relationships feel strained, and I can’t shake this feeling of hopelessness. I try to put on a brave face, but inside, I’m just exhausted.    I know I should reach out for help, but I don’t even know where to start. I feel so alone in this, and it’s hard to talk to friends because I don’t want to burden them with my problems. I wish I could just have a moment of clarity or peace, but it feels like that’s slipping further away.    I miss the days when things felt simpler and more manageable. I just want to feel like myself again. If you have any advice or just some words of encouragement, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for listening.

__label__1 I'm currently working on a C++ project where I need to read data from a file and assign that data to specific variables. I have a basic understanding of file I/O in C++, but I'm not sure about the best practices for reading different types of data and handling potential errors.     Here's a simplified version of what I'm trying to achieve:    1. The file contains several lines, each with a specific format (e.g., `name age height`).  2. I want to read each line, parse the data, and assign it to appropriate variables (e.g., `std::string name; int age; float height;`).  3. I also want to ensure that I handle any errors that may occur during file reading, such as the file not existing or having incorrect data formats.    Could someone provide a code example or outline the steps I should follow to accomplish this? Additionally, any tips on error handling and best practices for file I/O in C++ would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been playing My Singing Monsters for a while now, and I have to say, the new wave of monsters introduced in the latest update has really blown me away! The designs are so creative and unique, and I love how they each bring something different to the islands.    One of my favorites has to be the new epic version of the Wubbox. The way it interacts with the other monsters is just so fun, and the sound it produces is a perfect blend of all the elements. I also appreciate how the developers have incorporated more seasonal themes into the new monsters, giving us a fresh take on the classic designs we all know and love.    I’m also curious about how these new monsters will affect the overall gameplay. With the addition of new breeding combinations and the potential for new islands, I can’t wait to see how the community adapts and what strategies we come up with to maximize our monster collections.    What do you all think about the new wave? Any favorites or strategies you’ve discovered? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 Watching the presidential debate really got me thinking about the state of our political landscape and how it affects us as individuals. It’s fascinating to see how candidates present their ideas and policies, but it also makes me reflect on the importance of critical thinking and not just accepting everything at face value.     One thing that stood out to me was the way candidates handle tough questions. It made me consider how important it is for leaders to be transparent and honest, rather than just giving rehearsed answers. I find myself wondering how much of what they say is genuine versus what they think will get them votes.     Additionally, the debate highlighted the divide in opinions among the electorate. It’s a reminder that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences that shape our views. I think it’s crucial for us to engage in conversations with people who have differing opinions, rather than just surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals.     Lastly, I was struck by the role of social media in shaping public perception. It’s incredible how quickly information (and misinformation) spreads, and it makes me think about the responsibility we all have to fact-check and seek out reliable sources. Overall, the debate was a mix of entertainment and a serious reminder of the work we need to do as informed citizens.
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about how awesome it would be to have a Limited Time Mode (LTM) that cycles through different game modes every week or two. Imagine the excitement of logging in and not knowing if you’ll be playing a classic battle royale, a team deathmatch, or even a capture the flag style game!     Here are a few ideas for modes that could be included in this cycling LTM:    1. **Gun Game**: Start with a basic weapon and progress through a series of weapons with each kill. The first player to get a kill with the final weapon wins!    2. **Kingslayer**: A mode where the objective is to eliminate the player with the highest number of kills. This would create a fun dynamic where everyone is gunning for the top player, making for some intense gameplay.    3. **Survival of the Fittest**: A mode where players drop in with no weapons and must scavenge for gear while avoiding a shrinking circle. This would really test players' survival skills and adaptability.    4. **One Shot, One Kill**: All players have a sniper rifle and one shot to take down their opponents. This would require precision and strategy, making every shot count.    5. **Team Revive**: A mode where players can revive their teammates but only a limited number of times. This would encourage teamwork and strategy in deciding when to revive or when to push for kills.    I think cycling through these modes would keep the game fresh and exciting, giving players a reason to log in regularly to try out the new gameplay styles. Plus, it could help balance out the meta by allowing players to experience different weapons and strategies in a fun way.    What do you all think? Any other modes you’d like to see included in a cycling LTM? Let’s brainstorm!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m reaching out because I’ve been experiencing some really concerning symptoms lately, and I’m hoping to get some insight or advice from those who might have gone through something similar.     For the past few weeks, I’ve had episodes where my heart races uncontrollably, I feel like I’m about to faint, and I struggle to catch my breath. These episodes can last anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour, and they often leave me feeling completely drained afterward. I’ve noticed that they tend to happen more frequently when I’m standing or after I’ve been active, but sometimes they just come out of nowhere.    I’ve been diagnosed with POTS for a while now, but I’m starting to wonder if there’s something else going on or if my symptoms are just getting worse. I’ve tried increasing my salt and fluid intake, and I’m on medication, but it doesn’t seem to help much during these episodes.     Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? What did you do to manage them? I’m feeling a bit lost and scared, and I could really use some support or advice on what steps to take next. Should I be reaching out to my doctor again, or is this something that’s common with POTS?     Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!

__label__1 I recently came across some discussions about the Xbox Series X and its specifications, particularly regarding VRAM. It seems that the Xbox Series X has 16GB of GDDR6 memory, while the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 has 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM.     This got me thinking about how this difference in VRAM might affect gaming performance and graphics quality. While the Xbox Series X has more VRAM on paper, it's important to consider how that memory is utilized in a console environment compared to a PC. The architecture and optimization for games on consoles can lead to different performance outcomes despite the raw numbers.    For instance, the Xbox Series X is designed specifically for gaming, with a unified memory architecture that allows for efficient use of its VRAM. On the other hand, the RTX 3070 is a powerful GPU that excels in a wide range of applications, including gaming, but also tasks like rendering and machine learning.    I'm curious to hear what the community thinks about this. Does the higher VRAM in the Xbox Series X mean it will perform better in certain scenarios, or does the RTX 3070's overall architecture and capabilities outweigh the VRAM difference? How do you think this will impact future game development for both platforms?

__label__1 Hello fellow rat lovers!    I’ve been thinking about expanding my rats’ free-roaming space beyond just the bathroom, but I’m a bit unsure about how to do it safely and effectively. I want to let them explore a larger area, like my living room or even my bedroom, but I’m worried about potential hazards and how to keep them safe.    What are some tips you all have for rat-proofing a larger space? Are there specific things I should look out for, like cords, small gaps, or items they might chew on? Also, how do you manage their safety while still allowing them to explore?     Do you have any tricks for encouraging them to roam and play in a bigger area? I want to make it a fun and enriching experience for them!     Thanks in advance for your advice! 🐀❤️

__label__1 Klay Thompson playing 30 minutes per game is a topic that has been on my mind lately. Given his injury history and the importance of managing his minutes, I think this is a solid target for him this season.     When Klay is on the floor, he brings a unique blend of shooting, defense, and experience that is crucial for our success. However, we all know that he’s coming off some serious injuries, and the Warriors need to be smart about how they utilize him.     If he can consistently play around 30 minutes, it allows him to stay fresh while still contributing significantly to the team. This also opens up opportunities for younger players to get more minutes, which is essential for their development.     I’m curious to see how the coaching staff manages his minutes throughout the season. Do you think 30 mpg is the sweet spot for Klay, or should they be more conservative? What are your thoughts on how this will impact our playoff run?

Shoutout to Shawn and Morgan for being such awesome fans! Can’t wait to see you both at the next event! Who else is planning to catch ICW NHB in the future?

__label__1 I’ve been feeling chronically unhappy for a while now, and it’s really starting to weigh on me. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of negativity and I can’t seem to break free. I try to focus on the good things in my life, but they often feel overshadowed by this persistent cloud of sadness.     I find it hard to connect with people, even those I care about. I feel like I’m a burden when I try to share how I’m feeling, so I often just keep it to myself. I know I should reach out for help, but the thought of opening up is terrifying.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you cope with chronic unhappiness? I’m looking for any advice or just a space to share and feel less alone in this struggle.
__label__1 I just had the most frustrating experience with a customer today. I was shopping for a large order, and the customer had requested a lot of specific items. I spent over an hour in the store, carefully picking everything out, only to find that half of the items were out of stock. I tried to communicate with the customer through the app, suggesting alternatives and asking for their preferences, but they were unresponsive.     When I finally completed the order and delivered it, the customer was upset that I couldn’t get everything they wanted. I explained the situation and that I had tried to reach out, but they still left a low rating and a small tip.     I understand that sometimes things don’t go as planned, but it’s so disheartening to put in all that effort and still get penalized for circumstances beyond my control. Has anyone else had similar experiences? How do you handle it when customers are unhappy despite your best efforts?

What are some best practices for documenting conversations in a way that is compliant with the law? Should I take detailed notes during the conversation, and if so, what specific information should I include? Additionally, is it advisable to follow up with an email summarizing the discussion to ensure that both parties are on the same page?     I want to make sure I’m protecting myself and maintaining transparency, but I also want to respect the privacy and legal rights of my coworkers. Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated!

Should I just shoot it and clean it as needed, or is there a specific routine I should follow to ensure it lasts? Any tips on maintenance would also be appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__0 I had to delete a post I made yesterday because it sounded too negative and I ended up making myself sound like some religious, sanctimonious prude. I personally am repulsed and afraid of ended up in a situation pressuring me to have sex with someone. I have serious social anxiety. I never want anyone viewing my private parts. I'm also self conscious about that. I did not think about what it all entailed until I was 28. I was extremely naive when it came to anatomy of the sex organs. I used to think of it being as simple as a hot dog weiner and slit between the legs rather than these layers and bumps. I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds human genitalia ugly and horrifying. For a person with sensory issues, those images to me are shocking. I personally prefer my own privates to be tucked away where not a soul can access it. That is just how I feel. I'm extremely shy and I get embarrassed to death. The whole thing sounds overwhelming - the sounds, the movement - It makes me feel like fainting. I tried being open and thinking if I loved someone madly enough, it would come natural and be a beautiful experience. I'm just too afraid. Is there anyone else who feels this way?
__label__1 I've been toying with the concept of what I’m calling "The Halcyon Effect" in my writing, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.     The term "halcyon" evokes a sense of peace, tranquility, and a golden age of happiness. In my stories, I’ve noticed that certain moments or settings create a profound sense of calm and nostalgia, almost like a refuge from the chaos of the characters' lives. These moments often serve as a stark contrast to the turmoil they face, and I believe they can be pivotal in character development and plot progression.    For instance, in one of my recent pieces, I wrote a scene where the protagonist finds solace in an old, abandoned library filled with dust and memories. The stillness of the place allows them to reflect on their past and consider their future, creating a moment of clarity amidst their struggles.     I’m curious if anyone else has explored similar themes in their writing. How do you create these moments of tranquility? Do you think they enhance the narrative, or do they risk slowing down the pacing? I’d love to hear your experiences and any techniques you use to evoke this "Halcyon Effect" in your work.
__label__0 Ok so I was checking up on the [timeline](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline) and Ozymandias takes place around March 20, 2010. We know Saul uses the vacuum service a couple of days after that, so when he tells Francesca to take that call there are still 8 months remaining. And Nippy ends in late October 2010. So in fact the November 12 call still has not happened. Assuming the caller is Kim, do you think he left some kind of clue of his next location?    Also of note, at this point in time the events of Felina and El Camino have already taken place.
__label__1 I recently came across a situation where a store owner used lethal force against a thief who was attempting to steal merchandise. This has raised a lot of questions for me regarding the legality of such actions.     From what I understand, the use of lethal force is generally only justified in self-defense situations where there is an imminent threat to one's life or serious bodily harm. However, I am curious about the specific laws that govern the use of force in a property crime context.     Is it legal for a store owner to use lethal force against a thief if there is no realistic threat to their life or health? Are there any specific laws or precedents that outline the circumstances under which a store owner can defend their property?     Additionally, what are the potential legal consequences for a store owner who uses lethal force in a situation where it may not be justified?     I appreciate any insights or references to relevant laws that could help clarify this issue.
__label__0 TL:DR at the bottom.      I have been living without heating or air in my house since November 17 of 2021. The initial company that came out deemed that my HVAC unit would need to be replaced. When running the new duct work and wiring, they said there was raw sewage leaking under my house. We had several plumbers come out over a 2 month span and deem that there was no sewage leaking, just a bit of moisture collection.       &amp;#x200B;    The heating company eventually dropped the contract and refused to do any work on our unit no matter what. This began a long string of phone calls where I called my land lord everyday. Each day, a new representative would answer and I would have to re explain the entire situation. These people always reassured me that something would be done but nothing ever came of all those calls and hours upon hours spent on hold.       &amp;#x200B;    In March, I resigned the lease, stupidly, because I did not have the financial means to move out of the house at that time. They increased my rent by $120. I have paid my rent in full and on time each month.      &amp;#x200B;    It is now mid July, and I still have zero capability to heat or cool my home. I purchased and installed window units in desperation to try and combat the heat. These window units have shorted the wiring in the house. I called in a maintenance order for that. When the tech came, a tech employed directly by the company, he said there was nothing he could do and that we should just move out.

__label__1 I’m currently in the process of planning my journey towards FIRE and I’ve been considering taking a sabbatical before fully committing to retirement. I’m curious if anyone here has taken time off from work before reaching their FIRE goals and how that experience was for you.    I’m 32 years old, working in tech, and I’ve been saving aggressively for the past few years. I have a decent nest egg of about $150,000 in various investment accounts and I’m on track to reach my FIRE number in about 5-7 years if I keep my current pace. However, I feel a bit burnt out and I’m wondering if taking a year off to travel, learn new skills, or just recharge would be beneficial for my mental health and overall well-being.    If you’ve taken a sabbatical, how did you manage your finances during that time? Did you find it helped you refocus on your FIRE goals? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been playing a lot of the latest Cold War title, and I have to say, the aim assist is driving me crazy. It feels like it’s way too strong, especially in close-quarters combat. I find myself getting killed by players who seem to have a direct line on me without even aiming properly.     I understand that aim assist is there to help players, especially those who might not have the best aim, but it feels like it’s tipping the scales too much in their favor. It’s frustrating to put in the effort to line up a shot only to have the game almost do it for the other player.     I really hope the developers take a look at this and consider toning it down a bit. It would make for a more balanced and competitive experience. Anyone else feeling the same way?
__label__0 So I am a fairly new DM starting a new campaign today. For the first session I don’t want the standard “oh fuck it’s a lot of goblins” but rather something more fun and engaging! What are some of your favorite first sessions you have been a part of?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m currently looking to buy Minoxidil in the Netherlands and I’m not sure where to start. I’ve heard that it’s available in pharmacies, but I’m also curious if there are any online options that are reliable.     If anyone has recommendations for specific stores or websites where I can purchase it, I would really appreciate it! Also, if you have any tips on the best brands or formulations to look for, that would be great too.     Thanks in advance!
__label__0 My sales have been stagnating on shoes over $100  since ebay changed the structure. I am working through  adjusting prices to reflect the $14.95 additional charge  which I was offering free shipping prior. As a consumer,  paying $14.95 for shipping would to high and  psychologically free shipping is much, much better.  Would love to here what everyone here thinks.

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 25-year-old woman looking to expand my circle of friends, especially other women. I recently moved to a new city and while I love exploring, it can get a bit lonely sometimes.     A little about me: I’m a huge fan of hiking and being outdoors, so if you enjoy nature, we could definitely plan some adventures together! I also love trying out new coffee shops, binge-watching shows (currently obsessed with anything true crime), and I’m always down for a good book recommendation.     I’m looking for friends who are open-minded, fun, and enjoy having deep conversations as well as light-hearted banter. Whether you want to chat about life, share memes, or plan a meet-up, I’m here for it!     Feel free to drop a comment or send me a message if you’re interested in connecting. Let’s make some great memories together!

__label__1 What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.    **I plan to use this PC primarily for gaming, including titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and some indie games. I also want to do some video editing and streaming on the side.**      What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?    **$1800 AUD**      When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.    **I’m looking to buy the parts within the next couple of weeks.**      What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)    **I just need the PC itself, as I already have peripherals and a monitor.**      Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in AU, do you have access to a local store?    **I’m in Australia and have access to local stores like MSY and Umart.**      If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.    **I will be reusing my 27" 1440p monitor, a mechanical keyboard, and a gaming mouse.**      Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?    **I’m not planning to overclock right away, but I might consider it in the future if needed.**      Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)    **I would like a fast SSD for quick load times, at least 1TB of storage, and a good GPU that can handle 1440p gaming smoothly.**      Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?    **I prefer a mid-tower case with good airflow and some RGB lighting would be nice, but it’s not a dealbreaker. I’m open to any color scheme.**      Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?    **I do not need a copy of Windows; I already have a license.**      Extra info or particulars:    **I’m looking for a balance between performance and aesthetics, aiming for a build that can handle modern games at high settings while also being visually appealing.**
__label__0 Hello, how’s everyone doing? I’m looking for a long-term roleplay partner themed around superheroes/supervillains and such. I’m familiar with a good bit of Marvel and DC although I’m not looking to play a canon character myself—nor expecting anyone else to play one. If you wanted to RP something based on those fandoms, then I’m fine with it, though. Bring any OCs you already have or we can figure out characters together!    I’ve been writing for about ten years. I’m 24 so I’d prefer partners at least 18. A matter of comfort, honestly. I’m in CST but I don’t mind roleplaying with partners in other time zones.     I like to tackle a variety of themes with my roleplay, but I prefer action, adventure, and a bit of humor. I also prefer third-person but I can do first-person as well. I’m semi-literate to literate since I write more when inspired. I keep up with my partner.     All I’m looking for is someone with a few ideas to share and willing to discuss plots and ideas before we get an RP started.     Thank you for reading and hope to hear from you. If you’re interested then shoot me a message or chat. I don’t have a discord set up currently but it's in the works.

__label__1 I have a 7-year-old Labrador mix who has always been a gentle and friendly dog. Recently, I've noticed a change in her behavior regarding food. She has started to show signs of possessiveness, especially when she’s eating or if I try to take away her bowl after she’s finished. She growls and even snaps if I get too close.    This behavior is new and quite concerning for me. I’ve always been able to take her food away without any issues, and she’s never shown any aggression before. I’m not sure what could have triggered this change.     I’ve read that food possessiveness can sometimes stem from insecurity or fear, but I’m not sure how to address it. I want to ensure she feels safe and secure, but I also need to manage this behavior for the safety of everyone in the household.    Has anyone else experienced this with their dogs? What steps can I take to help her feel more comfortable and reduce this possessiveness? Any training tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Attracting a man through direct messages (DMs) can be a bit tricky, but it’s definitely possible! Here are some tips that might help you make a good impression:    1. **Be Genuine**: Authenticity is attractive. Start with a friendly greeting and a genuine compliment or comment about something you both share an interest in. This shows that you’re interested in him as a person, not just trying to get his attention.    2. **Use Humor**: A little humor can go a long way. If you can make him laugh, it can create a connection and make your conversation more enjoyable. Just be careful with humor; make sure it’s appropriate and doesn’t come off as forced.    3. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Instead of yes or no questions, ask things that require more thought and can lead to deeper conversations. For example, instead of asking, "Did you watch the game last night?" you could ask, "What did you think of the game last night?" This encourages him to share his thoughts and keeps the conversation flowing.    4. **Be Playful**: Flirting through DMs can be fun! Use playful teasing or light banter to create a flirty vibe. Just make sure it’s all in good fun and that he’s responding positively to it.    5. **Share Interesting Content**: If you come across a meme, article, or video that you think he would enjoy, share it with him. This not only shows that you’re thinking of him but also gives you something to talk about.    6. **Be Confident**: Confidence is attractive. Don’t be afraid to express your thoughts and opinions. If you’re confident in yourself, it will show in your messages.    7. **Know When to Back Off**: If he’s not responding or seems disinterested, don’t push it. Sometimes, it’s best to give him space and let him come to you.     8. **Be Patient**: Building attraction takes time. Don’t rush things or expect immediate results. Let the conversation develop naturally.    Remember, every person is different, so what works for one guy might not work for another. Just be yourself and have fun with it!

__label__1 I've been eyeing the Lenovo Legion R9000P 2022 for a while now, and I'm curious if anyone here has had the chance to use it or has any insights on its performance and overall value.     From what I've gathered, it comes with some impressive specs, including the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, which should handle gaming and productivity tasks quite well. The 16-inch QHD display with a 165Hz refresh rate also seems like a great feature for gamers.    However, I’m particularly interested in how it performs in real-world scenarios. How's the thermal management? Is the battery life decent for a gaming laptop? And what about the build quality and keyboard experience?     If anyone has made the leap and purchased this model, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is it really worth the investment, or should I consider other options? Thanks in advance!

__label__0 So my friend is in a somewhat relationship and lives with her child’s father but is very unhappy. She DMed this guy we both went to highschool with he wasn’t really interested/thought based on her situation it couldn’t work because he is in the same friend group as her child’s father. He would text her here and there but was generally uninterested. Me and him flirted here and there in highschool, and I had a crush on him back then. He ended up finding my page from her page and DMed me said I was pretty. I did tell my friend he messaged me. We had a quick little conversation but then felt bad and ignored the rest of his messages. He continued to pursue me pretty aggressively asking me out, I would find and excuse to not see him. Then he told me, “no excuses next time your mine”. So I decided to see him one night and it went pretty well. I know it isn’t an ideal set up, I didn’t mean to hurt my friend and I care about her, I know it’s typically the stupidest thing to choose a guy over a friend. Am I a bad friend/person for seeing where this goes with him. I do really like him, but I know my friend feels like why me and not her.

__label__1 I know this might not be a popular opinion, but I think Jennifer Lawrence has a weirdly bloated face. I get that she's a talented actress and has a huge fan base, but every time I see her in interviews or on the red carpet, her face just looks puffy or swollen. It’s not just a bad angle or lighting; it seems to be a consistent thing. I’m not trying to body shame her or anything, but I just don’t understand why people rave about her looks when I can’t help but notice that aspect. Am I the only one who sees this?

__label__1 I've been struggling with binge eating for a long time, and recently I've noticed a shift in my coping mechanisms. Instead of turning to food, I've found myself binge shopping. At first, it felt like a great distraction and a way to fill the void that binge eating used to occupy. I would buy clothes, gadgets, and even things I didn't need, just to get that rush of excitement.    However, now I'm starting to realize that this isn't a healthy coping strategy either. My bank account is suffering, and I often feel guilty about the things I've bought. I still have that same urge to escape my feelings, but now it's manifesting in a different way.     Has anyone else experienced this? How did you manage the transition? Did you find healthier ways to cope, or did you end up addressing the underlying issues that led to both binge eating and binge shopping? I could really use some advice or support right now.

__label__0 I need to get my asus laptop's display fixed (under warranty) from nehru place service center, do I contact customer support before or just walk in service center and be like "hey this isn't working can you fix this?"
__label__0 I like the idea of Multiversus classes, but they are somewhat flawed in some ways. I’m going to try to fix that with my own ideas.    *Characters with two classes*    Just make it so characters can have more than one class, such as Bruiser/Tank hybrid, which could be a faster version of a tank character that is still large enough to be comboed easily. Of course, this should not be overused.    *“New” classes*    Bugs Bunny and T&amp;J are the main arguments for why the class system does not make sense. They have strong melee attacks AND wall you out with projectiles. But if you take a closer look, they both do have things in common: they wall you out with projectiles and large melee attacks. They should be moved from the mage/ranged class to a new class, which I will call the “Trickster” class.   Of course, these two should get some sort of nerf related to them being in this class. I think their melee attacks should have more endlag or startlag on some of their moves, incentivising predicting opponents and using tools only when the time calls for it, making the characters feel like themselves even more so. They are both slapstick kinds of characters, and good slapstick needs good timing to really hit correctly.    *The Assassins*    The assassin class should not be limited or given to all sword characters. All assassin characters should be fast (in terms of attack speed, not necessarily movement speed) and perform combos, but have bad damage output if misused and also be quite light. The “glass cannon” thing shouldn’t exist, if you want to make a character a glass cannon then put it in the character themselves, don’t just add a weird aftereffect. Also, I think having traps is an “assassin” trait. You need to be smart to be an assassin after all, so using traps is quite a nice quality.    Let’s go over what the classes should mean    **Offensive Classes**    *Bruiser*    High damage output and mobility, but struggles against properly spaced attacks and projectiles.     Opposite of trickster class.    *Tank*    Extremely powerful and heavy, but slow (in terms of attack speed and mobility) and easy to combo.    Opposite of mage/ranged class.    *Assassin*    Fast attacks and high speed, but quite frail.     Opposite of support class.    **Defensive Classes**    *Trickster*    Large attacks and tricky special moves, but has slow melee attacks.     Opposite of bruiser class.    *Mage/Ranged*    Zones the enemy out with powerful large attacks and projectiles, but cannot fight up close (due to weak melee attacks or use of specialized attacks)    Opposite of tank class.    *Support*    Uses large attacks/projectiles and secondary effects/special moves, but has weak attack and/or launch power.    Opposite of assassin class.    Why did I put them into defensive and offensive categories and then make some of them opposites of each other? Because I’m CRAAAAZY! (and also I find it fun for some reason idk why)    Lets Reclassify some Characters!    *Wonder Woman (Tank?)*    Wonder Woman is weird. She’s a tank class character, but not very slow. She also has good range. I suppose she’s fine as a tank class.    *T&amp;J (Trickster/Ranged)*    We already went over this. Large attacks, slow attack speed. But T&amp;J also like to zone and overwhelm the opponent like a mage would, so I’d be wrong to not make it their secondary class.    *Superman (Tank)*    The definition of a tank class character.    *Steven (Support/Bruiser)*    Steven is very weird. Steven has support based abilities and special moves, but also great combos and even a perk centered around combos (bubble bounce). He plays defensively by playing offensively. Being a combination of two opposites, they are a specialized character.     *Shaggy (Bruiser or possibly Bruiser/Tank)*    The most basic character in the game, likes to rush you down. Quite obvious what class he is, although he does have some tank-esque moves and qualities.    *Reindog (Mage/Bruiser)*    Very projectile based moveset, which says that he’s a mage, but Reindogs melee attacks are far from weak. Reindog likes to mix up between spamming projectiles and getting setups to getting up close and doing good damage with their melee attacks, though Reindog usually likes to stay back and get setups and will do so freely if the enemy does not engage, which is why Reindog is mainly a mage. Reindog’s only support moves are the love leash, which can also simply be used for free damage in 1v1s, and the power crystal, where the support aspect is just a secondary effect.    *Jake (Bruiser/Trickster)*    Jake runs at you and bombards you with disgustingly large attacks, zoning you out at an uncomfortable range. Jake is mainly a bruiser because he still runs at you, just with the intent to punch you from a mile away.    *Harley (Assassin/Trickster)*    Harley has half the moveset of an assassin, and half the moveset of a trickster. She gets off flashy combos, but also has somewhat slow yet very large hammer attacks. Still, she usually uses these hammer attacks to finish combos, which is why she’s mainly an assassin.    *Garnet (Bruiser)*    Garnet punches you. Sure she has some support options, but come on, every character in this game does.    *Finn (Bruiser)*    Maybe we should rename the bruiser class… but the idea is still there. The only difference between Finn’s playstyle and the average bruiser’s playstyle is that he has no problem with large disjointed attacks, because he can just challenge them with his own.    *Bugs Bunny (Trickster)*    This one is obvious, and we already went over it. They should probably make him slower though.    *Batman (Assassin)*    He does combos and uses traps. Enough said.    *Arya (Assassin)*    She does combos. Enough said.    *Velma (Support/Mage)*    Velma mainly supports her allies and has lots of effects, but also has large attacks and plenty of projectiles.    *Taz (Bruiser)*    Bruiser. He chases you down and violently eats your ass.    *The Iron Giant (Tank)*    Mfw I’m really big and heavy and I get hit by attacks.    *LeBron (Bruiser)*    LeBron is a bruiser. Sure he throws his ball, but I think that’s just like saying Batman is a ranged character because he can throw a batarang. LeBron is usually aggressive and plays offensively.    Alright, that’s finally over with  Now let’s take a look at the numbers of main classes for no reason:    Tank-3  Trickster-2  Support-2  Bruiser-6  Mage/Ranged-1  Assassin-3    So there’s lots of bruisers, but that was already the case with the main game so who cares. I also don’t mind the lack of mages; they are a very odd and specialized class. Anyways, how many are pure classed vs. double classed?    Pure-11  Double-6    Huh, I thought there were more doubles. This is a good thing though, having two classes can be a bit weird in large amounts. Imagine if there was only one pure classed character.    Alright, got any thoughts if your own?
__label__1 I've been trying to troubleshoot some connectivity issues on my network, and I suspect it might be related to the order of my firewall rules in the UDM Pro.     Currently, I have the following rules set up:  1. Allow all traffic from the LAN to the WAN  2. Block all traffic from the WAN to the LAN  3. Allow specific ports for a couple of services (like SSH and HTTP) from the WAN to the LAN  4. Allow traffic between VLANs    I’ve noticed that some devices on my LAN are having trouble accessing certain services, and I’m wondering if the order of these rules could be causing the issue.     Is there a best practice for ordering firewall rules in the UDM Pro? Should I be placing the specific allow rules before the general block rule? Any advice on how to properly structure these rules would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 When I learn something new, I definitely take notes! I find that writing things down helps me retain information better and gives me a reference to look back on later. Here’s how I usually approach note-taking:    1. **Organized Structure**: I create a clear structure for my notes. I often use headings and bullet points to break down complex topics into manageable sections. This makes it easier to review later.    2. **Summarization**: Instead of writing everything verbatim, I summarize concepts in my own words. This forces me to process the information and understand it better.    3. **Code Snippets**: When learning programming, I include code snippets that illustrate key concepts. I often write out examples and explanations of what each part of the code does.    4. **Visual Aids**: I sometimes draw diagrams or flowcharts to visualize processes or relationships between concepts. This can be especially helpful for understanding algorithms or data structures.    5. **Review and Revise**: After my initial note-taking, I go back and revise my notes. I might add additional information or clarify points that I didn’t fully understand at first.    6. **Digital vs. Handwritten**: I prefer digital notes because they are easier to organize and search through. However, I sometimes write by hand when I want to focus without distractions.    Taking notes has really helped me in my learning journey, especially in programming where concepts can build on each other. How do you all approach note-taking? Any tips or tools you recommend?
__label__1 I'm looking to buy a DAC/Amp combo in Australia and would love some advice on what to consider. My main goal is to improve the sound quality of my current headphone setup, which consists of a pair of Sennheiser HD 598s. I primarily use them for music listening and some gaming, so I'm looking for something that can handle both well.    **Budget**: I'm hoping to keep it under AUD 500, but I can stretch a bit if there's a significant improvement in quality.    **Current Setup**: I’m currently using a basic onboard sound card from my motherboard, and while it’s decent, I feel like I’m missing out on the full potential of my headphones. I usually listen to a mix of genres, including rock, electronic, and classical, so I want something that can handle a wide range of music.    **What I’m Looking For**:   1. **Sound Quality**: I want a noticeable improvement in clarity and detail.   2. **Power**: I’ve read that the HD 598s don’t require a ton of power, but I want to ensure that the DAC/Amp can drive them well without distortion.  3. **Portability**: While I primarily use my headphones at home, I’d like something that I could take with me if needed, so a compact design would be a plus.  4. **Connectivity**: I’d prefer USB input for my PC, but having an optical input would be a bonus for future-proofing.    **Options I’ve Considered**: I’ve seen some recommendations for the Schiit Modi + Magni stack, the FiiO K5 Pro, and the AudioQuest DragonFly Red. However, I’m open to other suggestions, especially if there are local options available in Australia.    **Any Recommendations?**: If anyone has experience with these models or can suggest something else that fits my criteria, I’d greatly appreciate it! Also, if there are any local retailers in Australia that you recommend for purchasing, that would be helpful too.
__label__1 I've seen the term "white AF" used in various contexts, and it seems to spark a lot of debate. Some people use it humorously or to describe someone who embodies stereotypical traits associated with being white, like certain cultural preferences or behaviors. However, others argue that it can be derogatory and perpetuates stereotypes, which can be harmful.    So, is it an insult? It really depends on the intent behind the usage and the context in which it's said. If it's used to belittle or mock someone for their race or cultural identity, then yes, it could be considered racist. On the other hand, if it's used in a light-hearted or self-deprecating way among friends, it might not carry the same weight.    What do you all think? Is it just a playful jab, or does it cross a line into racism? Have you ever experienced or witnessed this term being used? How did it make you feel?
__label__1 HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts, is a term used to describe the martial arts practices that were developed in Europe from the late Middle Ages to the early modern period. These arts encompass a wide range of fighting techniques and styles, including the use of various weapons such as swords, polearms, and grappling techniques.    HEMA practitioners study historical manuals and treatises written by masters of the time, which detail techniques, strategies, and philosophies of combat. These texts often include illustrations and descriptions of techniques, allowing modern practitioners to reconstruct and practice these historical fighting styles.    The practice of HEMA can include various disciplines, such as:  - **Longsword**: Often considered the most popular weapon in HEMA, focusing on techniques with a two-handed sword.  - **Rapier**: A thrusting sword that was popular in the Renaissance period, emphasizing footwork and precision.  - **Spear**: Techniques for using a spear, which was a common weapon in medieval warfare.  - **Dagger**: Close combat techniques using daggers or other short weapons.  - **Grappling**: Techniques that involve throws, locks, and holds, often derived from medieval wrestling.    HEMA is not only about fighting; it also emphasizes historical research, physical fitness, and the development of a community of practitioners who share a passion for martial history. Many HEMA clubs and organizations exist worldwide, hosting tournaments, workshops, and seminars to promote the study and practice of these historical arts.    If you're interested in martial arts that combine physical skill with historical study, HEMA might be a great fit for you!
__label__0 My friend showed me Dancing with my Phone by HYBS [ https://open.spotify.com/track/4Zh9zZmEBoDLTKQRjXwict?si=0oqrOFUESrW9DTC2wB3MCg ] and this instantly reminded me of a song with a similar feel to it. I don’t remember any of the lyrics, I only remember how the first part of the chorus sounds. There’s a Vocaroo link below with my untrained attempt at mimicking the song i’m thinking of. Apologies if this is against the rules.    https://voca.ro/1o4grfiyzo3W    It’s not Best Friend by Rex Orange County [ https://open.spotify.com/track/47Bg6IrMed1GPbxRgwH2aC?si=1DiQIKwnTq2XMXVlhpRheA ]. The part between 3:28 and 3:33 of the song does sound heavily similar to the humming recording, but as I mentioned the part I remember is the chorus. Also, the part i remember is much slower, as i attempted to mimic.     Apologies for this all being very vague. I’ve attempted to make things as clear as possible but I understand that I’m still giving little to go off of. If someone does manage to find the song, you’re a miracle worker.
__label__1 I (25F) have a close group of friends that I hang out with regularly. Recently, they decided to start a new tradition of having dinner together every Friday night. I was excited about it at first, but then I found out that they planned to make it a potluck-style dinner where everyone brings a dish to share.    The problem is, I have a pretty severe food allergy to nuts, and I’ve had some bad experiences in the past where I’ve accidentally eaten something that contained nuts. Because of this, I’m very cautious about what I eat and prefer to stick to meals that I know are safe for me. I expressed my concerns to my friends, but they brushed it off, saying that they would make sure to label everything and that I should just take a risk and try some of the dishes.    I appreciate their intentions, but I really don’t feel comfortable eating food that I didn’t prepare myself, especially when it comes to my health. I told them that I wouldn’t be able to join them for dinner if it was going to be potluck-style, and I suggested that we could still hang out afterward or do something else together.    They were really upset with me and said that I was being dramatic and that I was ruining the fun for everyone. They think I should just trust them to be careful with the food. I feel bad for not wanting to join them, but I also don’t want to put my health at risk.     AITA for refusing to eat dinner with my friends because of my food allergy?

__label__0 Hi.  I wrote earlier about using my bike for grocery shopping. There is a bike parking rack but it’s not directly in front of the store (so I cannot see my bike when I’m in the store). I will have 2 u locks (1 kryptonite evolution and one NY series) and 1 large chain lock (the largest kryptonite chain lock, 1217). I will also be removing the battery, the seat post and maybe even the front wheel. My question is: if I’m shopping only for 25 min or so, how worried do I need to be? Should I come out and check on my bike every 5 minutes? I live in a major city so theft is everywhere. Every time I go shopping at this grocery store I don’t see any bikes so there will be no other bike being locked up. I would really rather bring the bike in but I understand there is a place to park my bike so I don’t want to get into a huge thing with the management there. Should I be safe? I’m not sure how worried I should be…
__label__1 I recently found myself in a situation where I had to take over a program of projects from a colleague who left the organization unexpectedly. This program consists of multiple interrelated projects, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with the transition.     I want to ensure a smooth handover and maintain momentum on all the projects involved. Here are a few steps I’m considering:    1. **Review Existing Documentation**: I plan to go through all the project plans, status reports, and any other documentation to understand the current state of each project.  2. **Meet with Team Members**: I want to schedule one-on-one meetings with the project managers and key team members to get their insights and understand any challenges they are facing.  3. **Stakeholder Communication**: I think it’s crucial to reach out to stakeholders to introduce myself and reassure them that the projects are in good hands. I want to gather their expectations and any concerns they might have.  4. **Assess Priorities**: I need to evaluate which projects are on track, which are at risk, and where I can provide immediate support or resources.  5. **Establish a Transition Plan**: I’m considering creating a transition plan that outlines my approach for the next few weeks, including key milestones and check-ins.    I would love to hear from anyone who has taken over a program of projects before. What strategies did you find effective? Any pitfalls to avoid? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I know we all have those days where we just don’t feel like getting in the shower, whether it’s due to being super busy, feeling under the weather, or just wanting to lounge around.

__label__1 I recently came across a post that was removed for promoting hate, and I'm struggling to understand how it fits that description. The content seemed to express a strong opinion about a particular group, but I didn't see any direct calls for violence or discrimination.     Can someone help clarify what specific elements in a post can be considered hate speech? Are there certain phrases or themes that are more likely to be flagged? I want to better understand the guidelines and ensure that I’m not inadvertently supporting harmful content. Any insights or examples would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just completed my first legendary run in Fallout 76, and I have to say, it was an absolute blast! I decided to tackle the run solo, and while it was challenging, the thrill of taking down legendary enemies made it all worth it.    I started off at the Cranberry Bog, where I encountered a few legendary Scorched. I was a bit nervous at first, but with some strategic use of my perks and a couple of well-placed grenades, I managed to take them down without too much trouble. The loot was decent, but I was really hoping for something special.    As I progressed, I made my way to the Mire and faced off against some legendary Ghouls. They were tougher than I expected, but I had my trusty handmade rifle and a stash of stimpaks to keep me going. After a few close calls, I finally took them out and was rewarded with a legendary weapon that I can't wait to try out!    The highlight of the run was definitely when I stumbled upon a legendary Behemoth. I had to be super cautious, but with some clever use of cover and a few teammates who joined in, we managed to take it down. The adrenaline rush was unreal!     In the end, I walked away with some great legendary gear and a ton of crafting materials. I can't wait to dive back in and try for even more legendary runs. Anyone else had a similar experience? What legendary items have you found that you absolutely love?
__label__1 I’m in my late twenties and have always had a complicated relationship with my dad. Growing up, he was often emotionally distant and focused on his work, which left me feeling neglected. We never really bonded over shared interests or had those heart-to-heart conversations that I see other people have with their parents.    Recently, I’ve been trying to reconnect with him. I reached out to see if he wanted to grab lunch, and to my surprise, he agreed. During our lunch, I tried to open up about my life and share some of my experiences, but he seemed uncomfortable and kept steering the conversation back to safe topics like the weather or sports.     I really want to have a better relationship with him, but I’m not sure how to break through the barriers that seem to exist. I feel like I’m putting in the effort, but I’m not sure if he’s willing to meet me halfway.     Has anyone else experienced something similar with their parents? How did you manage to improve your relationship? Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I recently stumbled upon a theory that suggests the moon landing was staged, and it got me thinking about the implications of such a massive cover-up. The idea is that the U.S. government, in a bid to win the space race against the Soviet Union, created a fake moon landing to showcase their technological superiority.     There are several pieces of "evidence" that proponents of this theory point to. For instance, they argue that the shadows in the moon landing photos appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that there were multiple light sources, which would imply a studio setting rather than the moon's surface. Additionally, some claim that the American flag appears to be waving in the vacuum of space, which shouldn't be possible without wind.    Moreover, there are claims that the technology of the 1960s was not advanced enough to safely land humans on the moon and bring them back. This leads to questions about the authenticity of the footage and the entire Apollo program.     While many scientists and experts have debunked these claims, the sheer scale of the conspiracy and the potential for misinformation makes me wonder: could there be some truth to it? What if the moon landing was indeed staged, and we are just scratching the surface of a much larger conspiracy?     I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Is there any credible evidence that supports or refutes this theory? Or is it just another wild conspiracy that people have latched onto?
__label__1 I wanted to share an idea that I believe could really help those who are worried about staying warm this winter, especially for those who may be struggling financially or facing homelessness. With the cold months approaching, I know many people are anxious about how to keep warm and safe.    My idea is to create a community initiative where we can collect and distribute warm clothing, blankets, and sleeping bags to those in need. We could set up drop-off points in local neighborhoods, schools, and community centers where people can donate gently used or new items. Additionally, we could partner with local businesses to sponsor collection drives or offer discounts for donations.    To make this initiative even more effective, we could organize volunteer groups to help distribute these items directly to shelters, food banks, and even on the streets. This way, we can ensure that the items are going to those who need them most. We could also include information on local resources for warmth, such as shelters and warming centers, to help guide people to safe places during extreme cold.    I believe that by coming together as a community, we can make a significant impact and help save lives this winter. It’s a small effort that can lead to big changes, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea or any suggestions on how to make it happen. Let’s work together to keep everyone warm and safe!
__label__1 I've been experiencing auditory hallucinations for the past few months, and it's becoming increasingly concerning. At first, it was just occasional whispers or indistinct voices that I could easily brush off, but now it's more frequent and clearer. Sometimes I hear my name being called, and other times it feels like there are conversations happening around me that I can't quite make out.    I don't have a history of mental health issues, but I have been under a lot of stress lately due to work and personal life changes. I also recently started a new medication for anxiety, and I'm wondering if that could be contributing to these experiences.     I’ve tried to talk to friends about it, but they don’t seem to understand how unsettling it is. I’m worried about what this could mean for my mental health and whether I should seek professional help.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? What steps did you take to address it? Should I be looking for a therapist or psychiatrist, or is this something that might resolve on its own? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I've been using my Bolt EV for a few months now, and one feature that I really appreciate is the rearview camera when parking. It makes backing into tight spots so much easier! However, I've noticed that the camera can sometimes be a bit glitchy, especially in low light conditions.     I was wondering if anyone else has experienced issues with the camera quality or responsiveness? Also, do you have any tips for using the camera effectively while parking?     I've been trying to rely on it more, but I still find myself looking over my shoulder a lot. Any advice on how to get the most out of the camera system would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks!
__label__0 I have been kicked out of the house 2 and a half times (third time no follow through). But I’ve come back to live with my parents after college because it was financially wise, I’d just broken off a 5 year relationship (turned engagement) with a narcissist and my dad was diagnosed with dementia (he is not the narcissist). It is really hard being back at home - we fight often over petty things that she uses to tear me down about. I sit in my room and sob, while she acts completely unaffected and laughs at a movie that is on. I want to go no contact but she has told me she will keep me from seeing Dad - and these years are the best of what he has left. I’m feeling trapped and like I’m losing my mind - she tells me I said or did things that I didn’t or retells stories from my childhood differently - trying to convince me I have something seriously wrong with my memory. And my dad can not back me up because he literally cannot remember! I am exhausted and feel like giving up. She sucks up all my joy for herself and I’m left feeling empty and used. I have a really hard time making friends because of the attachment style I learned from her - I over share too soon and cut them off before I think they’ll reject me. This combined with the pandemic, combined with breaking off my engagement has literally left me with zero support system except her and dad. And she knows it.   I’ve come here because I feel like I am at my breaking point. I’m trying to pay a therapist $100 a week but often I can’t manage it. Any encouragement, support resources you could offer would mean so much. One more thing that is adding to the complexity of this situation… she admitted to me recently that she is having an affair and has had multiple before this one and that my father was a horrible husband and treated her poorly. Further trying to narrow my support system to only her.   Sorry that was so much. Thanks for listening.
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sarah, and I am a single mother of two beautiful children, ages 7 and 9. I am reaching out to this community because I find myself in a difficult situation that I never thought I would be in.     Recently, I have been experiencing severe dental issues that have made it incredibly painful to eat and even speak. After visiting the dentist, I learned that I need extensive dental repair work, including fillings and possibly a root canal. Unfortunately, as a single mom working two jobs to support my family, I do not have the financial means to cover the costs of these necessary procedures.     The total cost of the dental work is estimated to be around $3,000, which is simply out of reach for me at this time. I have tried to save up, but with rent, groceries, and other bills, it feels impossible to set aside any money for this urgent need.     I am asking for your help, no matter how small. Any contribution would mean the world to me and would help alleviate the pain I am currently in. I want to be able to smile again and be present for my children without the constant discomfort.     Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I appreciate any support you can offer, whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this campaign with others.     With gratitude,  Sarah
__label__1 I can hardly believe it, but today marks one month since I decided to stop drinking! 🎉 It feels like a huge milestone, and I wanted to share my journey with all of you.     The first few days were tough, filled with cravings and a lot of self-reflection. I had to confront some uncomfortable feelings that I had been numbing with alcohol for years. But with each passing day, I felt a little stronger and more in control.     I’ve started to rediscover hobbies I had neglected, like painting and hiking. I even joined a local book club, which has been a fantastic way to meet new people and keep my mind engaged.     I can honestly say I feel more energized and clear-headed than I have in a long time. My sleep has improved, and I’m starting to feel more like myself again.     Thank you to everyone in this community for your support and encouragement. It’s been a game-changer for me. Here’s to many more months of sobriety! 💪✨

__label__1 In today's dating culture, it seems like everyone is encouraged to date multiple people at once to find the right partner. While I understand the logic behind it—casting a wide net to see who fits best—I believe this approach is fundamentally oxymoronic and undermines the very essence of what a relationship should be.    When you’re dating multiple people, how can you truly invest in any one person? Relationships are built on trust, intimacy, and a deep understanding of one another. If you’re splitting your attention and emotions among several people, it’s nearly impossible to form that kind of connection. It feels disingenuous to be exploring a potential future with someone while still keeping your options open with others.     Moreover, this practice can lead to a lack of accountability and commitment. If things get tough with one person, it’s all too easy to just move on to the next without putting in the effort to resolve issues. This creates a cycle of superficial connections rather than meaningful relationships.     I believe that if you’re serious about finding a partner, you should focus on one person at a time. This doesn’t mean you have to rush into exclusivity, but rather that you should give each person the respect and attention they deserve. It’s about quality over quantity.     In a world that often glorifies casual dating and non-commitment, I think it’s time we reconsider what we truly want from our relationships and whether dating multiple people really aligns with that goal.
__label__1 I recently received a notification that my account has been permanently suspended due to alleged sexual or suggestive content involving minors. I am completely baffled by this decision because I have never posted anything of that nature. I take these issues very seriously and would never engage in or promote any inappropriate content.    I have tried to appeal the suspension, but I haven't received any response yet. I’m worried that this could affect my reputation and future opportunities online.

__label__0 I fully understand why around 2/3 of the community HATE summoning. However, there are good arguments on why we shouldn’t shun this skill, at least not completely. I have some basic ideas on how we could handle it.    Compelling reasons to embrace the skill:    - The familiar mechanics has always been a thing. Look around the game and you will see either cosmetic pets or followers in some quests. It’s not a radical skill on its essence.    - Useful “follower” interface. Turning back to the first point, the skill’s interface and controls can even manage your pre-existing followers.     - Creative and smart concept. The reasoning behind summoning follows hunting, and it’s quite logical. If we have got a skill to hunt NPCs, shouldn’t we have a skill to take care of NPCs? The skill’s shaman-esque concept is beautiful and brilliant, because it’s full of potentiality. The player can interact with nature on an “spiritual” level.     - Low-effort development. This may sound nonsense, but it makes sense. The dev team would focus on mechanics adaptation and gameplay balance, rather than writing everything from bottom to top.     How to fix the skill    - GET RID OF every Beast of Burden (tortoise, yak…).  Needless to say, BoBs were the most annoying and radical change that summoning brought to RS2. The skill can thrive without them.     - GET RID OF temporary skill boosts. Nowadays, our community is extremely efficiency-focused, most players don’t want to summon some familiar on every skilling activity for the sake of EXP. Skilling bonus can be a thing, but they shouldn’t be EXP-based.     - Tanking and revenge familiars. Combat familiars are another very hot issue. Low-level and mid-level players should have access to a new class of defensive and counter-attack familiars, so that a PKer may think twice before summoning a titan.     - Charms can be collected either from combat or bonfires (skilling pathway). Dropped charms on combat can be automatically added to a handbag. AFK gameplay is not disturbed.     - Summoning points must be as expensive as prayer points. So draining rate, summoning pots and obelisks must be carefully reworked.     I didn’t comment on healing familiars and PvM dynamics. However, a summoning set may need up to 4 slots in the bag. Without BoBs, it would not always be a worth set up.     I don’t want to look pretentious, game balancing is not a piece of cake. There are plenty of things to think about, but I believe that summoning is a skill that fits into a refurbishment.

__label__0 If this already exists, I haven’t found it and I’d like to be educated about it. Otherwise:    I’m a runner and cyclist. I use Strava to analyze power output and so forth.    There needs to be a way to manually upload a WHOOP activity to Strava (and other integrations) after the activity is complete in the case that integrations was turned off.    Why? I don’t always leave WHOOP integrations turned on in order to avoid double-posting when I use my Garmin instead. Sometimes I forget to turn integrations back on before the activity is processed - other times I have turned the integration back on, but for some reason it turned itself off - this just happened yesterday.     Once the activity is processed, there doesn’t seem to be any way to get that file and manually upload it to Strava after the fact.    It would be great if activity files could be downloaded as a .gpx or tcx or fit.

__label__1 I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and I just need some space to breathe. As an introvert, I often find that social interactions drain my energy, and lately, it feels like everyone around me is demanding my attention. I love my friends and family, but sometimes I just need to retreat into my own little world to recharge.     It’s hard to express this need for solitude without feeling guilty or like I’m letting people down. I worry that they’ll think I don’t care or that I’m being rude. But the truth is, I care too much, and that’s why I need to step back sometimes.     I’ve tried to communicate this to those close to me, but it’s a struggle. They don’t always understand that my need for alone time isn’t a reflection of my feelings for them; it’s just how I cope with the world.     Does anyone else feel this way? How do you manage your need for solitude while still maintaining your relationships? I could really use some advice or just some reassurance that I’m not alone in this.

My question for the community is what are some of your old favorite matchups from standard past? Decks that're particularly fun to play, especially against each other and a mix of gameplay/strategy for extra credit!    Excited to hear everyone's take.
__label__1 I’ve been on a long journey of healing from CPTSD, and I’ve realized that one of the hardest things for me has been learning to be proud of myself. For so long, I felt like I was just surviving, going through the motions of life without really acknowledging my own strength and resilience.     Recently, I’ve started to take small steps to recognize my achievements, no matter how minor they may seem. Whether it’s getting out of bed on a tough day, completing a task I’ve been avoiding, or simply allowing myself to feel joy in a moment, I’m trying to celebrate those victories.     I’ve also been working on reframing my self-talk. Instead of focusing on what I haven’t done or how far I still have to go, I’m trying to remind myself of how far I’ve already come. It’s a process, and some days are definitely harder than others, but I’m learning that it’s okay to acknowledge my progress.     I’d love to hear from others in this community. How do you practice self-acceptance and pride in your journey? What small victories have you celebrated recently? Let’s support each other in recognizing our strength and resilience!
__label__1 I've been experimenting with different sidearms in Red Dead Online, and I wanted to get the community's take on what the best "quick fire" sidearm is.     For me, the Mauser Pistol has been a game-changer. Its rapid-fire capability allows me to take down enemies quickly, especially in PvP situations. The accuracy is decent, and the damage output is solid for a sidearm. Plus, the reload speed isn't too bad either, which is crucial when you're in the heat of battle.    I've also heard some players swear by the Semi-Automatic Pistol for its high rate of fire and stopping power. It seems like a great choice for those who prefer a more aggressive playstyle.    What do you all think? Do you have a favorite sidearm for quick draws? Any tips on how to maximize their effectiveness in combat? Let’s hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I've been thinking about upgrading my gaming setup and I'm curious if a PC rig that can run the Xbox app could serve as a direct replacement for an Xbox Series X.     I currently have a decent gaming PC with a good GPU and enough RAM, and I love the idea of being able to play Xbox Game Pass titles on it. However, I’m wondering if there are any limitations or downsides to using a PC instead of the console.     For instance, how does the performance compare? Are there any exclusive features on the Series X that I would miss out on? Also, is the experience of playing games through the Xbox app on PC as seamless as it is on the console?     I’d love to hear from anyone who has made the switch or has experience with both setups. What are your thoughts? Is it worth it to go the PC route, or should I stick with the Series X for a more console-like experience?

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’ve been having a frustrating issue with Ghost Recon Breakpoint lately. I was in the middle of a mission when I noticed that I’m missing an attachment for my weapon. I’m not sure if it’s a bug or if I just overlooked something.     Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve checked my inventory and it’s just not there. I’ve also tried restarting the game and reloading my save, but no luck.     If anyone has any tips on how to recover missing attachments or if there’s a known fix for this, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I think the last time I didn’t start an argument with someone who had a really out-there opinion was during a family gathering a few months ago. My uncle was going on about how he believes that the moon landing was faked and that it was all a government conspiracy. Normally, I would have jumped in to debate him, but I decided to take a different approach this time.     Instead of arguing, I just asked him questions about his beliefs. I was genuinely curious about how he came to that conclusion and what evidence he had. Surprisingly, it turned into a pretty interesting conversation where I learned more about his perspective, and he even acknowledged some of the points I made without it turning into a heated argument.     It felt refreshing to have a civil discussion instead of a debate, and I think it helped keep the peace at the family gathering. It made me realize that sometimes, it’s better to listen and understand rather than jump straight into an argument, even if you think the other person is completely wrong.
__label__1 I just finished watching Halloween Ends, and I have to say, it was quite the ride! I know some people are divided on how the trilogy wrapped up, but I found it to be a bold choice that took the story in a different direction than I expected.    **Small Spoilers Ahead!**     The film really dives into the psychological aspects of trauma and how it affects the characters, especially Laurie Strode and her relationship with her family. I appreciated how they explored the aftermath of the previous films and the lingering effects of Michael Myers on Haddonfield. The new character, Corey, added an interesting dynamic to the story, and I thought his arc was both tragic and compelling.    The final showdown was intense, and while some might argue it didn’t deliver the classic slasher vibes we’re used to, I felt it was a fitting conclusion to Laurie’s journey. The cinematography was stunning, and the score really elevated the tension throughout the film.    What did you all think? Did you enjoy the direction they took, or were you hoping for something more traditional? Let’s discuss!
__label__0 Hi y’all,    I agreed to go to this expensive dinner with my friends tomorrow, and I’m trying to find an excuse not to go since it’s not something I want to spend that much money on. Does anyone have any ideas? I don’t want to embarrass myself too much or just make it bc of how much it costs.
__label__0 My husband wants to go back to his home country due to the state of the US right now. We are in South Carolina and abortion has been outlawed. I have one child and want more but my pregnancies have been very high risk. My husband filed for bankruptcy before we got married. He has been paying it back but will not be finished for another year. Can we legally move back to his home country while still paying off this debt?

__label__1 In Season 6, Episode 1 of The Sopranos, titled "Members Only," we see a flashback to 1986 where Tony Soprano and Tony Blundetto (Tony B) are involved in a scheme to hijack Betamax tapes. This scene is significant for a few reasons.     Firstly, it highlights the changing landscape of the entertainment industry during the 1980s. Betamax was a popular format for home video recording and playback, and at the time, it was a hot commodity. The hijacking of these tapes reflects the mob's involvement in various illegal activities, including the theft of consumer goods that were in high demand.     Secondly, this flashback serves to deepen the character development of Tony B. It shows his willingness to engage in criminal activities alongside Tony, establishing their bond and the shared history that would later complicate their relationship. The scene also foreshadows the eventual fallout between the two characters, as Tony B's criminal choices lead him down a darker path.     Lastly, the choice of Betamax specifically is interesting because it represents a technology that ultimately lost out to VHS, paralleling the themes of ambition and failure that run throughout the series. Just like the Betamax, some of the characters' choices lead to their downfall.     Overall, the hijacking of Betamax tapes is a clever narrative device that encapsulates the era, the characters' dynamics, and the overarching themes of The Sopranos.

__label__0 To do this, i feel like i have a lot to do beforehand. I've been thinking of contacting some people, leaving letters and instructions on what to do with my belongings.     I feel like reaching out to people from my past is the hardest part because I don't know if they want to hear from me or not. I don't want to disturb them but I feel like it'd be better if I talked to them before ending it. If I put myself in their shoes, it's what I'd want. So idk.
__label__1 As Instacart shoppers, we all know how important ratings are for our success and future batches. I’ve been experimenting with some subtle techniques to elicit better ratings from customers without being too obvious about it. Here are a few strategies that have worked for me:    1. **Personalized Communication**: When I accept an order, I make sure to send a friendly message to the customer. Something simple like, "Hi! I’m excited to shop for you today!" This sets a positive tone and makes them feel more connected.    2. **Attention to Detail**: I always double-check the items in the cart and make sure to pick the best quality products. If I have to make substitutions, I explain why in a friendly manner. Customers appreciate the effort and are more likely to rate positively.    3. **Timely Updates**: I keep customers informed about their order status, especially if there are any delays or issues. A quick message saying, "I’m just finishing up and will be on my way soon!" can go a long way in making them feel valued.    4. **Presentation Matters**: When I deliver the groceries, I make sure everything is neatly packed and organized. I even take a moment to arrange the bags in a way that makes it easy for them to grab. A little effort in presentation can leave a lasting impression.    5. **Gratitude**: I always thank customers for their orders and let them know I appreciate their business. A simple "Thank you for choosing me to shop for you!" can make them feel good about their choice and encourage a positive rating.    6. **Follow-Up**: After the delivery, I sometimes send a quick message thanking them again and asking if everything was satisfactory. This shows that I care about their experience and can prompt them to leave a good rating.    I’d love to hear if anyone else has tips or experiences with this! What strategies do you use to encourage good ratings?

__label__0 Hello-    I'm getting annoyed with my computer.    (Skip to 'the problem" if you want JUST the problem and none of the before stuff, though it may or may not give you some more relevant information and context for what's going on)    \-----THE STORY-----    Recently my keyboard and mouse have started bugging out- on my art program it stars undoing and redoing things rapidly with no rhyme or reason, and sometimes crashes. My mouse will spaz out and fly all over the screen and randomly increase sensitivity. I thought this was just- my mouse and keyboard having a seizure or something so I just messed around with the 2 mouse and keyboard plugs (JUST THEM)    That didn't work- sooo... I just decided to play some games. I went to play some Divinity: Original Sin 2 and- crashed 3 times and bluescreened me. I get back in and my wall paper is gone and an error for a desktop not being there pops up along with AppData not being available?    I gave up on fixing the AppData thing but I fixed the desktop not being there and just went to play some games. Divinity refused to open, but Teardown worked fine, played some of that and decided I felt like doing some Plague Inc, Open that and... it- thinks steam isn't open...? alright... so I restart my computer because my brother said that it usually fixes it.    \-----THE PROBLEM-----    Ight cool, did that and- ooOOoo automatic repair! That should be helpful! Alright- "You need to sign in as an administrator to continue, but there aren't any administrator accounts on this PC?." it says, despite the fact I know my main account has admin powers. (And as it stated, no accounts were shown)    I press "Forgot your password or don't see your account?" and it tells me "This list only shows administrator accounts that have previously signed into this PC, and does not include standard user or domain accounts. You need to be signed in as an administrator to use some repair and restore tools. If you don't have a password for any of these accounts, you can restart to try signing into Windows to manage your user accounts." Ok, fair enough.    I reset to do just that, but it just throws me back. It resets and it says it's launching Automatic Repair, and then it throws me back to the "You need to sign in as an administrator to continue..." thing    Loop Loop Loop Loop Over and Over and Over again- I was told to hold F11 during start up- it was progress but nothing I did worked! \*Help!\*    I have a video of it but the subreddit won't let me send it so- no video
__label__0 I work at a children’s hospital as a contract employee, but I access medical records and contact patients/families. I noticed a patient today with absolutely horrifying signs of abuse that no one else seemed to report. I was a kid that should’ve had multiple hotlines places and no one did. So, I asked a senior nurse if it seemed concerning. They said yes.     I followed up with the nurse who saw them that day, the nurse running the department, etc. who all said I should call. I decided I’d call to report by offering the objective info available in the charts and that way, if it was a concern, they could move forward and I’d work with my company for next steps. If it wasn’t, it’d be the end of that but at least I reported it and didn’t raise unnecessary concern to my manager and boss. I didn’t want anyone crying over spilled milk before the milk even spilled.     My boss has told me I could’ve ruined the relationship with the hospital I work at, that I could be damaging our company as a whole, that I could be the cause of the hospital being charged with negligence for not reporting themselves. They said i was right to report it, but it was wrong for me to do the way I did and I could’ve damaged us immensely.     Fuck the child who needs help, right? Gotta preserve that contract.  I’ve been a crying mess.
__label__1 I've been diving into the Live Series market lately and wanted to share some insights and tips for anyone looking to make some stubs or just keep their collection updated.     1. **Monitor Player Performance**: The prices of Live Series cards fluctuate based on real-life player performance. If a player is on a hot streak or has a standout game, their card price can spike. Keep an eye on MLB games and player stats to anticipate these changes.    2. **Invest in Rising Stars**: Look for younger players who are performing well but may not have high card prices yet. If they continue to perform, their cards can increase significantly in value. For example, players like Julio Rodríguez or Bobby Witt Jr. have shown potential to rise.    3. **Sell During Events**: When there are events or missions that require specific Live Series players, their prices can increase. If you have cards that are in demand for these events, consider selling them at peak times.    4. **Check the Market Regularly**: The market can change rapidly, so make it a habit to check prices frequently. Use tools or websites that track card prices to help you make informed decisions.    5. **Be Cautious with High Demand Cards**: Some cards, especially those of popular players or those with high ratings, can be overpriced. Don’t rush to buy them unless you really need them for your team. Sometimes waiting can lead to better deals.    What strategies have you all been using to navigate the Live Series market? Any tips or players you think are undervalued right now? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I wanted to share some items that I’ve found really helpful to keep in a bag for emergencies or when my gastroparesis symptoms flare up. It can be tough to manage GP, and having a few essentials on hand can make a big difference. Here’s what I keep in my emergency bag:    1. **Electrolyte Drinks**: I always have a few packets of electrolyte powder or ready-to-drink options. Staying hydrated is crucial, especially if I’m experiencing nausea or vomiting.    2. **Ginger Candies or Tea**: Ginger is known for its anti-nausea properties. I keep ginger candies or tea bags in my bag to help settle my stomach when I start feeling queasy.    3. **Snacks**: I pack low-fiber, easy-to-digest snacks like applesauce cups, rice cakes, or protein bars. These are great for when I need a little something but can’t handle a full meal.    4. **Medication**: I always carry my prescribed medications, including anti-nausea meds and any other medications I might need. It’s also a good idea to have a list of your medications and dosages in case of an emergency.    5. **Heating Pad**: A small, portable heating pad can be a lifesaver for abdominal pain or cramping. I have a microwaveable one that I can easily take with me.    6. **Wet Wipes or Hand Sanitizer**: Keeping things clean is important, especially if I’m feeling unwell and need to use public restrooms.    7. **Comfort Items**: I like to have a small blanket or a cozy scarf. Sometimes, just having something comforting can help ease anxiety during a flare-up.    8. **Journal or Notepad**: I find it helpful to jot down my symptoms or thoughts when I’m feeling overwhelmed. It can also be useful for tracking what I eat and how it affects my symptoms.    9. **Phone Charger**: If I’m out and about, I want to make sure I can stay connected, especially if I need to call for help or let someone know I’m not feeling well.    10. **Emergency Contact List**: Having a list of important contacts, including my doctor’s number, can be really helpful in case I need assistance.    I hope this list helps some of you! It’s always good to be prepared, especially with a condition like gastroparesis. What do you all keep in your emergency bags?
__label__0 Hi People,     I am a guy with 50 hours a week job and mental health issues.     I also have a camera and want to learn photography and editing.     I have watched hundreds of videos, finished courses on Photoshop and can do minor jobs like retouching, blendings two photos together, make selections etc.     I know the technical part and I can learn more from Youtube.     I want to learn the concept part of arts, photography, and post processing. I want to come up with an idea before taking the photo and starting the editing process.     I want to be a thinking photographer not a casual snapper or 'presets dependent photo editor'.     I wish to make conscious decisions before doing things like enhancing shadows, highlights or colour grading photos.        I would love to read some books on art which establishes the concept, make me think and turn me into a knowledgeable person with a camera.     I want to create meaning with my photos for people. I want to communicate.    Kindly help.
__label__0 I recently agreed to do a hold for someone on account of them paying part of the price upfront for the hold (it's for almost a week and a half). We agreed that this payment is non-refundable and the buyer purchased the post through Depop.

__label__1 I’m curious how everyone handles updates in Stardew Valley! I know some players dive right in and start a new farm with all the new features, while others prefer to stick with their existing save files.     For me, I usually take a little time to read up on the patch notes and see what’s changed. I love the excitement of new content, but I also don’t want to mess up my current farm. I’ve been playing on my save for over 100 hours, and I’ve invested so much time into it!     When the last update dropped, I decided to start a new farm to explore the new features, but I still go back to my original save to maintain my relationships and farm. It’s like having two different experiences!     How do you all approach updates? Do you jump right into the new stuff, or do you prefer to stick with your established farms? Any tips for managing both? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently came across a music distribution service called Anti-Joy, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with it. For those who might not be familiar, Anti-Joy is a platform that focuses on distributing music that falls outside the mainstream, catering to niche genres and experimental sounds.     As an independent artist, I’ve always struggled to find a distributor that truly understands and supports the kind of music I create. I decided to give Anti-Joy a try after hearing some positive feedback from fellow musicians in the underground scene.     The sign-up process was straightforward, and I appreciated their emphasis on artist rights and fair revenue sharing. They also offer a range of promotional tools that are tailored for artists who are not necessarily looking for commercial success but rather want to reach a dedicated audience.     One of the standout features for me was their community aspect. They have a forum where artists can connect, share tips, and collaborate. It feels like a supportive environment where everyone is genuinely interested in helping each other grow.     I released my latest EP through Anti-Joy, and while it’s still early days, I’ve noticed a steady stream of listeners who resonate with my sound. The feedback has been encouraging, and I feel like I’m finally reaching the right audience.     If you’re an artist who feels overlooked by traditional distributors or if you create music that doesn’t fit neatly into popular genres, I highly recommend checking out Anti-Joy. It’s refreshing to see a platform that prioritizes artistic integrity over commercial viability.     Has anyone else had experiences with Anti-Joy or similar distributors? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I have a 2017 Shield TV that suddenly stopped working. It was functioning perfectly fine one moment, and then it just went dead. I tried unplugging it for a few minutes and plugging it back in, but nothing happens. The power LED doesn’t light up at all, and I can’t hear any fan noise or anything when I try to power it on.    Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a way to troubleshoot it, or is it likely that the device has completely failed? I really don’t want to have to buy a new one if there’s a chance it can be fixed. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I’m currently a senior in high school, and I’m having a major existential crisis about my future and college decisions. I’ve always been told that I need to have everything figured out by now, but honestly, I feel more lost than ever.     I’ve applied to a few colleges, but I’m not even sure if I want to go to college right away. I’m torn between pursuing a degree in something practical, like engineering, or following my passion for the arts, which feels much riskier. My parents are pushing for the former, and I can’t help but feel the pressure to choose a path that guarantees a stable job.     On top of that, I’m worried about the financial aspect. My family isn’t in a position to help much, and I’m concerned about taking on student loans. I’ve looked into community colleges and trade schools, but I feel like I’d be letting myself down if I don’t go to a four-year university.     I guess I’m just looking for advice or reassurance from anyone who has been in a similar situation. How did you navigate your college decisions? Did you ever feel this lost? Any tips on how to cope with the pressure and uncertainty would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I accidentally sent out an invitation for a clan war that I didn't mean to schedule. Is there any way to cancel or retract the invitation? I don't want to leave my clan members hanging or confuse them. Any tips or tricks on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 In a full PPR league, I need some advice on who to start in my flex position this week. Here are my options:    1. **Devin Singletary (RB, Houston)** - He’s been getting a decent amount of touches and has a favorable matchup against a weak run defense.  2. **Michael Gallup (WR, Dallas)** - With Dak back, he’s been more involved in the passing game, but the matchup is tough against a solid secondary.  3. **Rondale Moore (WR, Arizona)** - He’s been getting some targets, but the inconsistency of the Cardinals' offense makes me nervous.    Who do you think I should start in my flex? Any insights on matchups or recent performances would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 It’s feels miles away from souls like…. The combat is just different.   It does have stamina and melee weapons and dodge roll.   The combat feels more Skyrim with stamina then dark souls.   So far it’s not a true open world and there seems to be many branching story paths.   I’ll have to play it again to be sure.  But anyway, I really enjoy this game and highly recommend it.  AMA
__label__1 If you're looking for a non-conventional take on the serial killer genre, I highly recommend *The Silence of the Lambs* by Thomas Harris. While it features the iconic character of Hannibal Lecter, what sets this book apart is its psychological depth and the exploration of the mind of both the killer and the investigator, Clarice Starling. The narrative delves into themes of trauma, power dynamics, and the complexities of human nature, making it more than just a straightforward thriller.    Another great option is *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* by Stieg Larsson. While it does involve a murder mystery, the focus is less on the killer and more on the investigation and the characters' backstories, particularly Lisbeth Salander's. The book tackles issues of misogyny, corruption, and personal redemption, which adds layers to the typical serial killer narrative.    For something even more unconventional, check out *My Sister, the Serial Killer* by Oyinkan Braithwaite. This darkly comedic novel follows a woman whose sister has a habit of killing her boyfriends. The story is told from the perspective of the sister who is both protective and horrified by her sibling's actions, creating a unique blend of humor and horror that challenges traditional tropes.    Lastly, *In the Woods* by Tana French offers a psychological twist on the serial killer trope. The protagonist, a detective with a traumatic past linked to a childhood murder, investigates a new case that echoes his own history. The book is rich in atmosphere and character development, making it a gripping read that goes beyond the typical serial killer narrative.    These books all provide fresh perspectives on the genre and delve into the psychological and societal implications of their stories, making them stand out in the realm of horror literature.
__label__0 Okay so to preface this, I’ll say that I’m not 100% sure yet that she’s actually ghosted me. We’ve been drifting apart for about a month now and talking less and less. We were texting a week ago (Wednesday) and all the sudden she just stopped replying. Haven’t heard from her since and don’t know why.    We met on bumble in february and went on a couple of dates in person. At this point we were living in the same town. The dates were awesome and we both really liked each other. I then had to relocate due to COVID and we agreed to continue talking and pick up where we left off when I was able to move back to the city she lives in (where we both go to school). I still have not moved back, and we had been doing really good at keeping in touch and continuing to progress our relationship despite everything until about a month ago, when I got the news that I wouldn’t be able to move back to her city for an extra few months. Since then we had started to talk less but I was trying to stay optimistic, and I’m planning to visit some friends in her city in about a week, so I had offered to take her out to do something if she had time. She texted me back on Wednesday, ignored that question, and we had a totally normal conversation about something else when she just stopped replying. Now I haven’t heard from her in almost a week.     It’s also maybe important to note that she has some chronic health issues that have occasionally gotten in the way of her communicating consistently, but she’s usually good about letting me know that she’s gonna be MIA for a few days when she’s in a hard spot, and this time, she hasn’t, it’s just radio silence.    Am I being ghosted? And should I keep trying to reach out to her, or just wait?

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I've been considering switching to AT&T Prepaid for my mobile service, but I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons. I’ve heard a lot of good things about their prepaid plans, but I’m curious about the reasons someone might choose not to go with AT&T Prepaid.     Here are a few concerns I have:  1. **Limited High-Speed Data**: I’ve seen that some prepaid plans have a cap on high-speed data, and once you hit that limit, the speeds drop significantly. For someone who uses a lot of data, that could be a dealbreaker.  2. **Network Coverage**: While AT&T has good coverage in many areas, I’ve heard that it can be spotty in rural locations. I travel a lot for work, so I need to ensure I have reliable service wherever I go.  3. **Customer Service**: I’ve read mixed reviews about AT&T’s customer service, especially for prepaid customers. If I run into issues, I want to make sure I can get help quickly and efficiently.  4. **Device Compatibility**: I’m currently using a phone that I love, and I want to make sure it’s compatible with AT&T’s network. I’ve heard that some devices might not work as well on prepaid plans.  5. **No Contract Benefits**: While the lack of a contract is a plus, I’ve also heard that some postpaid plans come with perks like better device financing options or family plan discounts that might be worth considering.    So, what are your thoughts? Why wouldn’t you choose AT&T Prepaid? Any experiences or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been using Duolingo for a while now and have built up a nice streak, but I'm about to go on a camping trip where I won't have any internet access for several days. I'm worried about losing my streak!     Does anyone have tips on how to maintain a streak without internet? I know there are offline lessons available, but I'm not sure how to make the most of them.     Also, if I do manage to complete some lessons offline, how do I ensure they sync properly once I regain internet access?     Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’m reaching out today because I find myself in a very difficult situation and I need your help. I am currently living in a toxic home environment that has become unbearable. The constant negativity and emotional turmoil have taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel trapped.    I am trying to leave this situation and start fresh, but I don’t have the financial means to do so. I need funds to cover basic expenses like moving costs, a security deposit for a new place, and essential living expenses until I can get back on my feet.     I have set up a GoFundMe page to help raise the necessary funds. Any amount you can contribute would mean the world to me. I am also grateful for any shares or support you can provide to help spread the word.    Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I truly appreciate any help you can offer as I work towards a healthier and happier life away from this toxic environment.    [Link to GoFundMe]      With gratitude,    [Your Name]
__label__1 안녕하세요! 제가 방금 한국어로 쓴 문장을 영어로 번역해 주실 수 있나요? 궁금한 내용이 많아서요. 감사합니다!
__label__0 Good morning my love,    These past 15 days have been rough. I haven't been in a good headspace for the last couple of months and this breakup has made it significantly worse. I never told you about how bad I was doing because I knew that if I did you wouldn't have agreed to break up. It's funny really, I thought that I had been processing the inevitable for the last few months of our relationship, but to be honest with you I'm falling apart.    It isn't just our breakup that's hurting me so much: It's everything really. My future, job prospects, living situation post-graduation, debt. Everything that had already began building up these past few months has now bubbled over, and I no longer have you by my side to reign me in.     It's strange to be in a mental crisis and suddenly realize your person is no longer there for you: In fact, they aren't **your** person at all anymore. You told me that if things got bad I should reach out to you, but I won't: It wouldn't be fair to you or me.     I was doing  okay until we chatted two days ago, and now I'm really in the thick of it. It was strange to hear your voice, your laugh, your sniffles. Our chat in the beginning flowed really well, I almost forgot I was talking to my ex. You gave me updates on your life, and I cried so much afterwards, because I realized I don't know anything about your life anymore.     I feel like I'm drowning over here. I can't sleep, I don't eat, I'm having panic attacks, and I am just constantly so, so sad. I know it will get better over time, but it makes me sick to think that maybe one day I won't miss you anymore.    I don't think you miss me all that much - either that or you were just good at hiding your emotions over the phone. Everything felt so formal, and I understand why, but that doesn't make it hurt any less. I'm trying not to hold onto the hope that we'll be together again, but I haven't accepted the fact that you may not be apart of my life anymore. Everyday I pray that you'll text me: That you'll reach out and show me that you care as much as I do. It's selfish of me, really. Despite this, however, it does bring me peace to know that you are doing okay. If you were falling apart I would be crazed with worry. I still care about you more than you'll ever know, and I just want you to be happy, even if that happiness means you no longer want me.    I think what hurts the most, though, is that in three months - when we've agreed to begin talking again - you may  realize that you don't want me anymore. Maybe that would be for the best, but it doesn't seem right that a love like ours is just simply not enough.    I hope you'll send me a letter like you said you would, but I understand if you don't.    Goodnight my love.
__label__0 Hi, everyone. u/gorhill4 recommended me “{site url}##+js(aeld, scroll)” to get rid of infinite scrolling on sites. This string didn't work on [sozcu.com.tr](https://sozcu.com.tr). Is this possible to get rid of this differently? Thanks in advice.
__label__1 Coming to terms with my sexuality was a journey that took several years. I grew up in a conservative environment where being gay or bi was not openly accepted, which made it difficult for me to accept myself. I spent a lot of time in denial, trying to fit into the mold of what was expected of me.     In high school, I dated girls and tried to convince myself that I was straight. I was never outright mean to the girls I dated, but I definitely wasn't fully honest with them or myself. I think I was emotionally distant at times, which may have come off as being a jerk. I was struggling with my own identity and, in hindsight, I realize that I may have unintentionally hurt them by not being genuine.     It wasn't until my early twenties, after some self-reflection and exposure to more accepting communities, that I began to embrace my bisexuality. I started to understand that my feelings were valid and that I deserved to be true to myself. Coming out was liberating, and I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.     Looking back, I wish I had been more honest with the women I dated. I think it would have been better for both of us if I had been upfront about my feelings. Now, I try to be as open and honest as possible in all my relationships, regardless of gender. It’s a learning process, and I’m grateful for the growth I’ve experienced.
__label__0 So I’m just kind of sick of life anymore and it’s getting harder and harder to handle every single day I decided to keep going or manage to refrain from doing something I probably shouldn’t because it would hurt the people around.     I’ve spend almost my entire childhood being bullied and abused in someways from almost ever single person I met. Anyone that didn’t bully me ended up hating me because of my metal health issues one of which being my adhd so everyone thought I was annoying. Even the teachers treated me like shit because of my adhd and odd I was hard to handle and was really defiant. To many to have teachers treat you like shit some be come kind of an achievement.     Then I met one person in my life she was one of the greatest person I have ever met to date and she was the only person I could be 100% myself with. I ended up at like 12 aiming to spend my entire like with as a friend. Then she and I both ended up moving to different states to which a year later she ended up dying because she was paralyzed from the neck down and her body just couldn’t handle it anymore.     I ended up dropping out of school after that because another teacher had no sympathy over the matter. Then from there I ended up meeting a guy who I hung out with for a bit then I was 14 by this point and I had like ten bucks so we convinced a older women to buy in some vodka. The only women was drunk and flirty to use but more to me so he got upset and went home end calling her phone upset got me to go over to his to which he ended up sexually assaulting me wouldn’t quit touching me so I had to sleep under his bed until his mother wakes up in the morning to which I left and never hung out with him again. Then he end up showing up at my library saying I stole money from him and he was going to attack me out side if I didn’t admit it. So I did then he left a few week later at a dance he had three guys chase me down and attack me but some luck some people driving but broke that up.     Then a few months later I ended up meeting a guy I ended up working for but still being young he touched me as well and I tried my best to avoid it if I could because I needed the money so I stayed. Other then that he was helpful and he mostly respected my space minus a few times where he tried to groom me but I didn’t give in. From there not much happened until I was 18 when I met my first long term girlfriend to which my mother lost her house and we had to move back to the state I came from states there for about 3 to 6 months.     To which my girlfriend ended up making me pick between moving with her to Idaho. Now I wished I would have stayed with my mother and tried dating one of my childhood friends who I have known my whole life but she wasn’t the nicest when we were kids. So about 3 to 6 months later I woke up to see the look on her dead mothers face which still haunts me to this very day I still see her some nights when I close my eyes. To which we had To move back to where we started.  To which I had to sleep at the office where I worked because her father wouldn’t let me stay with them.     So I spent 3 months bouncing around place to place until my mother moved back to which I met my next  girlfriend about 3 months after that and spent a long 3 years in a very abusive relationship the mental abuse was the worst I still suffer from that trauma today. She cheated on me multiple times, then my grandfather past away and she continued treating me like shit even that day and ended up having my mother come comfort me because she wouldn’t. Then one of the last times she cheated up me was Thanksgiving to which she waited to tell me until after we had sex The thought of that one killed me inside.     Which lead to some really bad depression where around Christmas where she spend the whole time ignoring me and did something with two guys but said she didn’t have sex with but then traveled to have sex with a different guy to which I ended up breaking up with her but not learning my lesson because I tried to be her friend and with things out with her to which around Valentine’s days she went home to change and disappeared for an entire month or what felt like one to which she called me to tell me she went so some guys house slept with him and that she was dating him now which fucked with me even worse.     So with a lot of things wrong in my head I moved on as best as I could to find an amazing women I have spent the last 7 year with. plus this last year which was a down hill decline. Sadly the damage from the last relationship has caused to much damage and I don’t know if I can ever recover from but I did my best with this last one. But sadly she decided 2 weeks before my birthday that she didn’t want to be together and I’ve been dealing with that fallout and well it is now 2 days until my birthday. Then to make things worse I just remembered my grandfather’s birthday was 3 days after mine.     So I just don’t even know what to do anymore or how to keep going anymore. The fight for getting help is a pain in the ass. I’ve become so good at hiding my problems that I share them with no one I’ve hidden my adhd so well people don’t think I have it anymore and without it my therapist doesn’t think I can get disability with just bipolar so that’s fucking me and I’m trying to track down my past medical history which is taking for every. Just so I can prove the odd and adhd were really but is was from more then 15 years ago so I have to wait. I’m just not sure how much more I can handle at this rate and it is really getting hard to just not give up and wither away Because dealing with 30 years of like is hard enough and continuing is even harder.     So thank you to anyone that truly manages to read all this and I really mean that’s I’m just use to feeling like I’m not heard anymore so thank you.
__label__1 I've been exploring my style and leaning more into feminine clothing lately, but I have a quick question for everyone here. How do you all feel about mixing feminine and masculine pieces together? I love the idea of wearing a cute skirt with a more androgynous top or pairing a flowy blouse with some fitted jeans.     Do you think it’s a good way to express yourself, or do you feel like it’s better to stick to one style? I’m still figuring out what makes me feel most comfortable and confident, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences! Thanks in advance!

__label__0 I'm not jewish but I would like to better understand your religion, one for which I have much respect. Whilst I know reading the whole thing is a monumental task, and one I do not intend to complete, I would like to know where one even reads the Talmud. Thanks for your help!
__label__0 I’m 22(m) and couple of days ago I had a massive fight with my mom. My mom had a very difficult marriage with my abusive and alcoholic dad. The one thing that kept her living was me and my brother. She has suffered a lot in her past and fought so many battles all by herself to help us get where we are today. I love her so much because what she is done for us and my only goal is to make her proud.Long story short I was in Canada for 4 years in college and my girlfriend from high school and I were doing it long distance for 4 years. I got back to India 2 months ago and we only went out a few times. Given that this is India and you can’t do things like in western countries and her parents didn’t know about our relationship. She got a job further away and she moved. So I wanted to go stay with her for a couple days before I leave for Canada again. And my mom disapproved saying that’s not appropriate ( understandable given the circumstances she was brought up on) but I disagreed and said I’m going anyways. She is been always very good friend to me and very supportive about the relationship. One thing led to another and I said some harsh words which made her so sad. She hasn’t been talking to me since. Now I think about it I could have handle the situation very differently but it’s in the past and I can’t do anything about it. I can see she is so hurt and that makes me so sad. I said sorry but it’s not gonna resolve any of this. I’m conflicted

__label__0 Usually ol' Hollywood Howie will read him emails praising his interviews and since his last show was Wednesday with Hanoi Jane Fonda, one would figure the emails would be flowing in, even the fake staff-written emails praising the interview.

__label__1 Simulation theory posits that our reality could be an artificial simulation, akin to a computer program, created by a more advanced civilization. This idea raises intriguing questions about the nature of existence and the role of a creator. In many ways, it parallels traditional creationist views, which assert that a divine being or beings created the universe and everything within it.    At its core, both simulation theory and creationism grapple with the origins of existence and the nature of reality. Creationism typically involves a supernatural deity who intentionally designs and creates the universe, while simulation theory suggests a technologically advanced entity or entities that have constructed our reality for reasons that may be beyond our understanding.    One could argue that simulation theory is a modern, secular reinterpretation of creationism, replacing the divine creator with a technologically superior being. This shift reflects humanity's evolving understanding of the universe and our place within it, as well as our increasing reliance on technology.     However, there are significant differences between the two concepts. Creationism is often rooted in religious texts and doctrines, while simulation theory is based on philosophical and scientific speculation. Additionally, simulation theory does not necessarily imply a moral framework or purpose behind the creation of our reality, which is often a key component of traditional creationist beliefs.    Ultimately, the question of whether simulation theory is a form of creationism invites a deeper exploration of what we consider to be 'creation' and the implications of our understanding of reality. Is it possible that as we advance technologically, our interpretations of existence will continue to evolve, blurring the lines between science, philosophy, and spirituality?
__label__0 I'm a new LC player and would like feedback on an Impidimp set I made (especially EV spreads if this is viable, because I don't know how to approach EVs in LC)       ```  Impidimp @ Lagging Tail  Ability: Prankster  Level: 5  EVs: 196 Def / 236 SpA / 36 SpD / 36 SpD  Modest Nature  IVs: 0 Atk  - Trick  - Thunder Wave  - Dazzling Gleam  - Dark Pulse  ```      So the basic idea is that Impidimp gets Prankster thunder wave which is nice in my opinion because speed control is valuable in LC.       Against Mienfoo, it takes a fake out, tricks the Lagging Tail onto it to obtain its Eviolite (that way I don't have to lose the Eviolite on my own Mienfoo to knock off the opponent's). Even if the Eviolite is knocked off, Mienfoo now has a lagging tail and can be threatened with Dazzling Gleam. If it switches, another Pokémon will have to take a thunder wave before Impidimp is knocked out.       It is also immune to Abra's and Natu's Psychic and can switch into them and get off another thunder wave, potentially even a Dark Pulse if they get fully paralyzed or Impidimp survives.
__label__1 I accidentally left the cage open and Cash got out. I was in the other room for just a few minutes, and when I came back, I saw the cage door swinging wide open. My heart dropped! I immediately started calling for him, but of course, he was nowhere to be found.     I searched the living room, the kitchen, and even under the couch. I was starting to panic, thinking about all the places he could get into trouble. I finally found him in the pantry, happily munching on a piece of cereal that had fallen on the floor.     I couldn’t help but laugh at how mischievous he was being. He looked so proud of himself! I scooped him up and gave him a little cuddle, but now I’m worried about how to keep him from escaping again.     Does anyone have tips for making sure my little escape artist stays safe and sound in his cage? I’m thinking about adding some extra locks or maybe a latch to make sure this doesn’t happen again!

__label__0 When [googling "ethernet splitter"](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethernet+splitter&amp;tbm=isch) intuition immediately tells that you can have one input (where the cable coming from the router enters) which can be split to 2 computers at the other end.    However, this is not how it works:    &gt;To use splitters, you’ll need two: one to connect your two devices, and another at the other end to “unsplit” the connection. This means you’ll still be using the same number of Ethernet ports on your router as if you were using two separate cables. You don’t add any Ethernet ports by using a splitter, you simply share a single cable.    (source [https://www.howtogeek.com/797864/ethernet-splitter-vs.-switch-whats-the-difference/](https://www.howtogeek.com/797864/ethernet-splitter-vs.-switch-whats-the-difference/))    **QUESTION**: why isn't the signal simply **split** ? What is it that a switch does differently ?
__label__1 I’ve been reflecting on my relationship with my partner who has BPD, and I can’t help but wonder about the concept of trauma bonding. I’ve read that it can create a cycle of intense emotions, and I think I might be experiencing some of that myself.     There are times when I feel incredibly connected to them, almost like I can’t live without them. But then, when things get rocky, I find myself becoming obsessive and even controlling in an attempt to manage the chaos. I worry about their well-being constantly, and I feel this overwhelming need to fix things, even when they don’t want me to.     I’ve noticed that my behavior can sometimes push them away, which only intensifies my feelings of anxiety and fear of abandonment. It’s like I’m caught in this loop where my desire to help and protect them turns into a need to control the situation, which ultimately leads to more conflict.     Has anyone else experienced this? Can trauma bonding really lead to obsessive or controlling behaviors? How do you break free from that cycle? I want to be supportive without losing myself in the process.
__label__0 We broke up 4 months ago because she said she wasn’t in the mindset to commit because of her mental health issues and I didn’y want to have an only sexual relationship. Then, we started texting again. We texted everyday for 2 months and met a few days ago. We didn’t kiss, nothing sexual/romantic happened but we talked for hours. She said it was so nice to see me and that she wanted to keep meeting. But I don’t know what her intention is… Is this a friendly thing? Does she want to keep dating me etc… and no idea how to solve it and communicate.     Another point is that the whole time she talked about how she fixed her depression. And I saw her on a dating app looking for long term dating. She knows I liked her at that time. So I guess she would have communicated if she had wanted something? Or maybe she wants to do it slowly???
__label__1 I’ve been seeing a lot of buzz about the upcoming transmog feature in Cyberpunk 2077, but honestly, I’m not that excited about it. I get that it’s a way to customize our characters and make them look unique, but I feel like it might take away from the immersion of the game.     In a world where style and aesthetics are so important, I love the idea of finding gear that not only has great stats but also looks cool. I worry that with transmog, we might end up with a bunch of players running around in the same outfits just because they want the best stats, which could make Night City feel less vibrant and diverse.     Plus, I’ve always enjoyed the thrill of hunting for that perfect piece of gear that not only enhances my abilities but also fits my character’s style. I hope they find a way to balance it so that it doesn’t detract from the overall experience.     What do you all think? Are you looking forward to transmog, or do you share my concerns?
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately. It seems like everyone around me is hitting these big milestones—buying houses, getting married, having kids—and I can’t help but feel like I’m lagging behind. I’ve always been focused on my career and personal growth, but now I’m starting to wonder if I should have prioritized other things too.    Sometimes I scroll through social media and see friends traveling, starting families, or just living what looks like a more fulfilling life, and it makes me feel like I’m missing out. I know everyone’s journey is different, but I can’t shake the feeling that I need to catch up somehow.     Has anyone else felt this way? How do you cope with those feelings? Do you think it’s ever too late to start pursuing those experiences? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I've been on my weight loss journey for a while now, but lately, I've noticed that I keep gaining weight instead of losing it. I started at 220 lbs and got down to 200 lbs, but now I'm back up to 205 lbs. It's really frustrating because I feel like I'm doing everything right.     I track my calories, try to eat healthy, and exercise regularly, but it seems like no matter what I do, the scale just won't budge in the right direction. I know that weight can fluctuate for various reasons, but I’m starting to feel discouraged.     I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced something similar. What strategies did you use to get back on track? Are there any specific changes you made to your diet or exercise routine that helped? Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__1 With the transition to Overwatch 2, seasonal cosmetics have become a key feature that players are excited about. Blizzard has indicated that each season will introduce a new set of cosmetics, including skins, emotes, and other items that reflect the theme of that particular season.     These seasonal cosmetics will be available through the Battle Pass system, which means players can earn them by leveling up their Battle Pass during the season. There will also be limited-time events that may offer exclusive skins and items, encouraging players to participate and complete challenges to unlock these rewards.     Additionally, some cosmetics may be available for purchase in the in-game shop, allowing players who want to get specific items without grinding through the Battle Pass to do so. However, it’s important to note that Blizzard has emphasized that all seasonal cosmetics will be purely cosmetic and will not affect gameplay, maintaining the balance and fairness of the game.     Overall, the seasonal cosmetics in OW2 are designed to keep the game fresh and engaging, giving players new content to look forward to with each passing season.
__label__0 Hello,    I would like an approximate level of the PC's power through their level.    I could easily do it for the monsters by reverse engineering the GMG. For example, from level 1 to 20, the strike attack bonus and the AC increase by 29 while the saves increases by 26. This is expected as players can expect their strike attack bonus to increase by roughly 29 (19 from the levels, 4 from proficiency, 3 from runes, 3 from ability score). They can expect their AC to increase by the exact same amount (to keep AC and strike on par)      Similarly, the saving throws grow slower because both the proficiency and ability scores for saves can't expect to match the growth of "main attack", and this matches perfectly the spell attack bonus, which grows by only 25, which is a growth to be expected as their are no runes for spellcasters.    Anyways, this is a simple model that came from studying 15 pages of the GMG, and it applies to monsters (not players). I am confident there are nerds out there who have mapped things a lot more thoroughly. However, my Google-fu failed me, can someone point me toward a more thorough analysis?    Thanks!
__label__1 I've recently started my journey into learning C++ and I'm really excited about it! However, I have a few questions about when and how I should start applying what I've learned.     I’ve gone through some basic tutorials and I understand the syntax, variables, and control structures. I’m eager to start writing my own programs, but I’m not sure if I should wait until I have a more solid grasp of the language or if I can start experimenting with small projects right away.     Here are a few specific questions I have:  1. Is it beneficial to start coding small projects even if I don’t fully understand all the concepts yet?   2. What kind of small projects would be suitable for a beginner?   3. Should I focus on mastering certain topics before moving on to projects, or is it okay to learn as I go?     I appreciate any advice or resources you can share to help me get started on the right foot!

__label__1 I've been to Lost Lands a couple of times now, and I can share my experience with phone signal and data speed at the camping ground.     Generally, the signal can be pretty spotty, especially if you're deep in the camping area. Some spots have decent reception, while others might leave you searching for a better signal. If you're using Verizon, I've found it to be the most reliable, but AT&T and T-Mobile users might struggle a bit more.     As for data speed, it can be quite slow during peak hours when everyone is trying to upload photos or check social media. I recommend downloading any important info or maps before you arrive, just in case you can't get a good connection.     If you really need to stay connected, consider bringing a portable charger since you'll likely be using your phone more than usual. Overall, it's best to prepare for limited connectivity and enjoy the festival without too many distractions!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I hope you're all doing well! I have a question regarding how old grades from previous classes are factored into our GPA and academic standing. I took a few classes a couple of years ago that I didn't do so well in, and I'm wondering if those grades will still affect my GPA now that I'm further along in my studies.     Is there a way to retake those classes for a better grade, or do they stay on my transcript forever? Also, does anyone know if there are any policies about grade forgiveness or anything like that?     Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I wanted to share my experience in hopes that it might resonate with others who are considering leaving the profession. After five years in a busy ICU, I finally made the decision to quit, and it was not an easy choice.     Initially, I loved my job. The adrenaline rush of critical care, the camaraderie with my colleagues, and the satisfaction of making a difference in patients' lives kept me motivated. However, over time, several factors contributed to my decision to leave.     1. **Burnout**: The constant high-stress environment took a toll on my mental and physical health. I found myself feeling exhausted, both emotionally and physically, after every shift. The long hours, combined with the emotional weight of caring for critically ill patients, left me drained.     2. **Staffing Issues**: Our unit was chronically understaffed, which meant that we were often stretched thin. I frequently had to care for more patients than was safe, which not only increased my stress but also made me feel like I was compromising patient care.     3. **Lack of Support**: I felt that management was more focused on numbers and budgets than on the well-being of staff and patients. There was little recognition for hard work, and when I brought up concerns about staffing or patient safety, I often felt dismissed.     4. **Emotional Toll**: I started to notice that I was becoming emotionally detached from my patients. I was no longer able to connect with them the way I used to, and that realization was heartbreaking. I knew that if I continued down this path, I would lose my passion for nursing altogether.     5. **Work-Life Balance**: The demands of the job made it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I found myself missing important family events and feeling guilty for not being present in my personal life.     Ultimately, I decided to leave the ICU and pursue a different path in healthcare that would allow me to regain my passion for nursing without the overwhelming stress. I now work in a community health setting, where I feel more fulfilled and supported.     I know that every nurse's experience is different, and I truly admire those who continue to work in high-stress environments. But for me, it was time to prioritize my health and happiness. If you're feeling overwhelmed, know that you're not alone, and it's okay to consider other options.
__label__0 He does fit the pattern of big bosses/enemies like Gold King Boo and Gold King Bobomb, but that's not what the game needed at this point in no way
__label__1 I've been playing Smite for a while now, and I can't help but notice how iconic the phrase "Artemis flooped the pig" has become in our community. It's not just a meme; it’s a testament to how much fun we have with the game and its characters.     For those who might not know, this phrase originated from a hilarious interaction in the game that caught on like wildfire. It’s become a sort of rite of passage for new players to learn about it, and if you don’t say it, well, you’re just not doing it right!     I think it’s great how Smite has these little quirks and inside jokes that bring us all together. It’s moments like these that make the game feel more alive and connected. So, what are your favorite Smite memes or phrases that you think everyone should know? Let’s keep the fun going!
__label__1 I’m still reeling from the fact that my family didn’t show up to my wedding. I had always dreamed of a big celebration surrounded by loved ones, but when the day finally came, it felt like a nightmare.     I had sent out invitations months in advance, and I made sure to communicate how much it meant to me to have my family there. I even reached out multiple times to confirm their attendance. My parents and siblings assured me they would be there, but as the day approached, I started to feel uneasy.     On the day of the wedding, I was filled with excitement and nerves. I walked down the aisle, surrounded by friends and my partner’s family, but when I looked around, I realized my family was missing. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe they were just running late. But as the ceremony went on, it became painfully clear that they weren’t coming.     After the ceremony, I received a text from my mom saying they decided not to attend because they didn’t approve of my partner. They felt that my choice was a mistake and didn’t want to support it. I was devastated. I had hoped they would at least show up to celebrate my happiness, even if they didn’t agree with my choice.     The day was bittersweet. I was surrounded by love from my friends and my partner’s family, but the absence of my own family left a huge hole in my heart. I spent the reception trying to enjoy myself, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of betrayal and sadness.     Now, I’m left wondering how to move forward. I’ve always been close to my family, but this feels like a breaking point. I don’t know if I can forgive them for missing such an important day in my life. I’m still processing everything, and I just needed to share my experience. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you cope?
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’m in a bit of a spontaneous mood and I’m considering booking a solo trip with just two days' notice. I’ve been feeling the itch to travel, and I think a last-minute getaway could be just what I need.     Has anyone here ever done this? If so, how did you go about it? I’m looking for tips on:  - Destinations that are easy to get to on short notice (I’m based in the US, so ideally somewhere within a few hours flight)  - How to find affordable last-minute flights and accommodations  - Any advice on packing light and efficiently for a quick trip  - Activities or experiences that are great for solo travelers in a short time frame    I’m open to any suggestions or stories you might have! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Looking to purchase a used but good condition Logitech mx keys keyboard for Mac. The advanced illuminated version. Budget is $60 to 65$. Thanks!
__label__0 a while back i saw a music video by a french group, pretty sure it had yellow in the logo. The video was a guy leaving from a rooftop, getting on a moped delivering packages at night, which we later find out are drugs. we also follow a girl who goes to a party, and does said drugs. i cant remember much at all about the music itself, just that i liked it, kinda why im looking for it.    Thanks!
__label__1 I'm on the hunt for a pair of budget headphones under $150 that can deliver great sound quality for both music and casual gaming. I primarily listen to a mix of genres, including rock, electronic, and some classical, so I need something versatile.     Comfort is also a big factor for me, as I often wear headphones for extended periods. I’m open to both wired and wireless options, but if I go for wireless, I’d prefer something with decent battery life and low latency for gaming.     I've heard good things about brands like Audio-Technica, Sennheiser, and Sony, but I'm not sure which specific models to consider. Any recommendations or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Let's keep the good vibes going and support each other in finding these amazing events. Cheers!
__label__1 I've been reading a lot about different methods of consuming MDMA, and I came across the idea of snorting it. I know that the most common way is to take it in pill or capsule form, but I’m curious about the effects and risks associated with snorting MDMA.     From what I understand, snorting can lead to a quicker onset of effects, which might be appealing for some users. However, I’ve also heard that it can be harsher on the nasal passages and might lead to more intense side effects.     Has anyone here tried snorting MDMA? What was your experience like compared to taking it orally? Did you notice a significant difference in the intensity or duration of the high? Also, are there any specific precautions you would recommend if someone is considering this method?     Thanks in advance for sharing your insights!

__label__1 I’m really hoping to get some advice or insights from fellow pet owners or veterinarians here.     My dog, a 5-year-old Labrador Retriever, has been vomiting for the past 48 hours. We took him to the emergency vet yesterday, and they administered Cerenia to help with the nausea. They also did some blood work and an X-ray, which didn’t show any obstructions or serious issues.     After the treatment, he seemed to settle down for a few hours, but unfortunately, he started vomiting again this morning. He’s been lethargic and hasn’t eaten anything since this started. I’ve tried offering him some bland food, but he just turns away.     I’m really worried about him and feel helpless. The vet mentioned that if he continues to vomit, we might need to bring him back in for further evaluation. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and what steps you took.     Is it common for dogs to still vomit after receiving Cerenia? Should I wait it out a bit longer or take him back in? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
__label__1 With the trade deadline approaching, I've been thinking about potential opportunities for the 49ers to trade Jimmy Garoppolo. Given the current landscape of the NFL, there are a few teams that could benefit from his experience and skill set.     1. **New York Jets**: With Zach Wilson struggling, the Jets might be looking for a veteran presence to stabilize their offense. Jimmy could provide that while also giving them a chance to compete in a tough AFC East.    2. **Tampa Bay Buccaneers**: If Tom Brady decides to retire or if they want to move on from him, Jimmy could be a solid option for the Bucs. He knows the West Coast offense well and could step in as a bridge quarterback.    3. **Washington Commanders**: With their quarterback situation being a bit murky, they might be interested in acquiring a proven starter like Jimmy to help them push for a playoff spot.    4. **Atlanta Falcons**: If they decide to move on from Marcus Mariota, Jimmy could be a good fit in Arthur Smith's offense, especially with the weapons they have.    What do you all think? Are there other teams that might be interested? And what kind of return could we realistically expect for him? Let's discuss!
__label__0 What the title says, I'm excited!
__label__0 If I don't get into my #1 college I will kill myself. The college has a 16% acceptance rate.     If I don't get into this college, I will have so much debt to bear since ill be forced to go elsewehere and I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I asked my mom what I should do if I don't get into this college. She looked away from me and cried because she would be ashamed of me.     I wouldn't be able to live with myself. My parents won't be able to live with the disappointment.    I've had suicidal thoughts before, but this time I just don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. I don't see myself as myself if I'm not at a college where I can be helped financially and mentally.
__label__1 I recently unlocked Yui's Greek Legends outfit and noticed something interesting that I think many players might have missed! If you look closely at her outfit, it seems to have a hidden reference to Greek mythology. The design features subtle patterns that resemble ancient Greek motifs, and her color palette is reminiscent of the traditional attire worn by goddesses in ancient times.    But what really caught my attention is the way her hair is styled. It looks like a modern take on the classic Greek chignon, which was often worn by women in ancient Greece. This could be a nod to the strength and beauty of figures like Athena or Artemis, who are often depicted in similar styles.    Additionally, her perks seem to align with the themes of agility and cunning, much like the traits associated with Greek heroes. I wonder if the developers intended for this outfit to embody the spirit of these legendary figures?     Has anyone else noticed these details? What do you think about the connection between her outfit and Greek mythology? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I've been struggling with the impact that CFS/ME, fibromyalgia, and Lyme disease have had on my intimate relationships and overall sexual health. It's been really tough to navigate these issues, especially when it comes to communication with partners and understanding my own body’s limitations and needs.     I’m looking for recommendations for a sex therapist who has experience working with patients dealing with chronic illnesses like mine. Ideally, someone who understands the unique challenges we face and can provide tailored support.     If you have any suggestions or personal experiences to share, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!
__label__1 I've been dating someone for a few months now, and I can't shake this feeling that something is off. We have a lot of fun together, and I genuinely enjoy their company, but I often find myself overthinking our relationship. I worry about whether I'm good enough for them, if they really like me, or if I'm just imagining things.     Sometimes, I catch myself analyzing every little thing they say or do, trying to decipher their feelings. For example, if they take a while to respond to a text, I start to panic and think maybe they’re losing interest. I know this isn't healthy, but I can't help it.     I’ve talked to a few friends about it, and they say it’s normal to have doubts, but I feel like I might be taking it too far. I don’t want to ruin what we have by overthinking everything.     Is there something wrong with me for feeling this way? How can I manage these thoughts and focus on enjoying the relationship instead of worrying about it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 The term "misgendering" refers to the act of referring to someone using words or pronouns that do not correctly reflect their gender identity. I believe that by definition, it is impossible to misgender someone because gender is a personal and subjective experience.     Here’s my reasoning:   1. **Subjectivity of Gender**: Gender identity is deeply personal and can vary widely from person to person. What one individual identifies as may not align with societal norms or expectations. Therefore, if someone identifies as a certain gender, that is their truth, and any reference to them should ideally align with that identity. However, if someone chooses to identify outside of traditional gender categories, it can be argued that there is no "correct" way to refer to them, making misgendering a subjective term.     2. **Intent vs. Impact**: Misgendering often implies a negative intent or disregard for someone's identity. However, if someone is unaware of another person's gender identity or if that identity is fluid, it raises the question of whether misgendering can truly occur. If I refer to someone by a pronoun that does not match their identity, but I was unaware of their identity, can it be considered misgendering?     3. **Cultural and Linguistic Variability**: Different cultures and languages have varying concepts of gender. In some cultures, gender is not binary, and the language reflects that. Therefore, what might be considered misgendering in one cultural context may not hold the same weight in another. This further complicates the idea of misgendering as a universal concept.     I understand that many people feel strongly about the importance of using correct pronouns and affirming someone's identity, and I respect that. However, I believe that the definition of misgendering is inherently flawed because it relies on a shared understanding of gender that is not universally applicable.     I’m open to hearing counterarguments or perspectives that challenge my view. How do you define misgendering, and do you think it can be universally applied?
__label__0 This is a rather simple matter:    You can take as many frontloads as you want, but for every Frontload you take you need to reduce your starting CP by 100 and every UDS CP you'd gain will be reduced by half with 200 CP per Frontload, being further removed from the UDS Chainlong Drawback total.    If you take more Frontloads than 1000 CP can afford, you must take a number of Jump specific Drawbacks each Jump equal to the overpaid CP.    In return, each Frontload will have 300 CP for every Frontloaded Jump you took and you can add more CP by choosing Drawbacks from those frontloaded Jumps.    However, in return you need to use some of those Drawbacks in the Jumps you visit, equal to 1/4th the number of Frontloads you took, rolled down to the next fullest number.    So if you took 10 Frontloads you need to take 2 of these Drawbacks into each Jump. In return they pay properly unlike UDS Drawbacks.    These Jumps will replace the Bodymod and will make it impossible enter those Jumps. Additionally, if there is some starting CP quirk to those Jumps (Generic Military having 2000 instead of 1000 CP, Saber Wars counting in multiples of 50k) then apply the same multiplier to their respective frontload stipends.    You can import something you bought in one document's frontload into something else from another document's frontload, such as importing Sword of Promised Victory from Garden of Avalon into Azrael.    Your base form will be determined by a mixture of various perks, origins and race options you took in the Frontloads combined, you can pick and choose what carries over if you so wish.
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my experience cleaning my DW 9000 series pedals. After a few months of heavy use, I noticed they were starting to feel a bit sluggish and not as responsive as they used to be. So, I decided it was time for a deep clean.    First, I disassembled the pedals completely, which was a bit daunting at first, but I took my time and made sure to keep track of all the parts. I used a soft cloth and some warm soapy water to clean the metal components, being careful not to get any water on the bearings. For the plastic parts, I used a gentle cleaner to avoid any damage.    Once everything was clean, I dried the parts thoroughly and applied a small amount of lubricant to the moving parts, especially the springs and the beater hinge. I also checked the tension on the springs and adjusted them to my liking.    After reassembling everything, I was amazed at how much smoother the pedals felt! It’s like I have a brand new set of pedals again. I highly recommend doing this maintenance every few months to keep your gear in top shape.     Has anyone else done a similar cleaning? Any tips or tricks you’d like to share?     Happy drumming!
__label__1 This is a really interesting and complex question. If a relative of mine donated sperm, I think my feelings would be a mix of curiosity, concern, and maybe even excitement.     On one hand, the idea of having half-siblings I didn't know about could be intriguing. I might feel a sense of connection to them, especially if I ever met them or learned more about their lives. It could be fascinating to see how much we might have in common, both genetically and in terms of personality traits.    On the other hand, I would also have concerns about the implications of having unknown siblings. There could be issues around family dynamics, especially if the relative who donated sperm is still involved in my life. I might worry about how this could affect our relationships or if it would create any awkward situations.     Additionally, there are health considerations to think about. Knowing that there are more people in the family tree could mean more potential genetic health issues to be aware of. It might be important to have access to that information for my own health and for any future children I might have.    Ultimately, I think it would depend on the circumstances and how open everyone involved is about the situation. If it was handled with transparency and care, I could see it being a positive experience. But if it was kept secret or caused tension, it could be quite challenging.
__label__1 Hi everyone,    I’m reaching out to see if anyone has had any luck finding discounts or price reductions on Whoop accessories in the EU. I’m particularly interested in the new straps and the battery packs, but the prices seem a bit steep here compared to what I’ve seen in the US.    I’ve checked the official Whoop store and a few local retailers, but I haven’t found any promotions or sales. I’m wondering if there are any tips or tricks to get a better deal, or if there are any upcoming sales events I should be aware of.     Also, if anyone has experience with third-party sellers or websites that might offer better prices, I’d love to hear about that too.     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I have a 1995 Jeep Wrangler YJ and recently started having issues with the air conditioning. It’s not blowing cold air anymore, and I’ve noticed some strange noises coming from the compressor. I took it to the dealership, and they recommended a full AC system recharge, along with replacing the compressor and the expansion valve. They quoted me a pretty hefty price for the repairs.    Before I commit to this, I wanted to get some opinions from the community. Is it common for the compressor to fail on these older models? Could it just be a simple recharge, or is it likely that the compressor and expansion valve really need to be replaced?     Also, if anyone has had similar issues, what was your experience? Any advice on what I should look for or ask the dealership? I want to make sure I’m not getting taken for a ride here. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with my Steam Deck when it's docked. It keeps waking up or turning on by itself, even when I'm not interacting with it. This happens randomly, and it's quite annoying because it interrupts my gaming sessions and drains the battery.    I've checked the power settings and made sure that the sleep mode is set correctly, but it still happens. I also tried unplugging and re-plugging the dock, but that didn't help either. Has anyone else experienced this issue? If so, do you have any tips or solutions that worked for you?     Thanks in advance!

__label__0 I hate this announcement, but my live tour is officially suspended through the end of the year.    If you have a ticket to this show (or any of the shows this year), your money will be refunded automatically. Please give it a few weeks as there’s a lot to process.    When I first suspended my tour, I suspended two weeks of it. Then a month, then two months. By the end of the year, I’ll have been off the road for almost 10 months which JUST eclipses my previous record of two weeks. I do not like this any more than you do. Probably less, even.    Even if the borders open up to us diseased, science-denying Americans, I cannot in good conscience tell people it is safe to come see me. Frankly, I don’t know if it is safe (and neither do you). None of us do – this is some scary shit, and I know more and more people who have died from it. And it’s super hard to do comedy while I’m dead. Act outs would be damned near impossible.    In addition to not dying, I also don’t want to kill anyone’s grandmother. Or end up “getting over” COVID-19 and still have lung problems or blood clots or other things that make it less comfortable to play GTA.    A lot goes into shows beyond just the show itself – and frankly, I don’t trust all the hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and truck stops to have suddenly learned what hygiene is. Some of the places we’ve stopped on the road haven’t been cleaned since before Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself.    I’m sure I will get responses from people that this is all just a hoax perpetrated by big pharma just to give Bill Gates an excuse to inject us with 5G so that he can install Windows 95 in your mom. And to them, I say, “01000110 01010101.”    I will continue live streaming for free on my YouTube and Facebook, four days a week. I will also be doing my weekly “Ask Us Anything” show at [NowhereComedyClub.com](https://NowhereComedyClub.com) (and I’m doing a full headlining set there later this month). I also have enough content to keep posting new videos through November, plus while I’m home I’ll do some vlogs and sketches, too. I may even write another book.    This sucks, for sure. Although not as much as killing someone’s grandmother. Thanks for understanding. And see you Nowhere, soon.    TLDR: I’m a comedian that had to cancel my tour and for those who had tickets, refunds will be processed automatically.
__label__0 I’m African-American (75%) and Caucasian (25%). Rarely talk to my (*estranged for political/racial reasons, don’t even ask*) white side of the family but I know they are pro-2A. But my black side of the family is delusional to their right to own a firearm. They have a victim mentality and believe that ALL guns are bad news, and a black person simply can’t survive bearing arms. I just think this is totally untrue, but is reality because of the complacency in black communities. Not looking for advice just wanted to start a conversation and see if anybody is having the same interactions with family or even peers.
__label__0 .     Been on 0.1 cream for 2 months and I miss the ease of 0.05.  Tbf, I moved up cos 0.05 seemed to stop working after the retinization period. My skin looked normal again and I had like 2 deep cysts after 4 months. I moved up to 0.1 micro and that was great but it's more expensive and the 0.1 cream isn't as nice. Thinking of dropping back to 0.05 cos of my new Curology prescription which has TxA, Aza and Niacinamide. And I want to use it alongside my unused Tret. But I'm thinking 0.1 will be too much.
__label__1 I've been experimenting with Nilou's abilities and I’m curious if there’s any gameplay reason to actually press her burst ability. I know her elemental skill is great for setting up her unique playstyle, especially with the Hydro application and the blooming reactions, but her burst seems a bit underwhelming in comparison.    From what I’ve seen, it doesn’t seem to deal as much damage as other characters' bursts, and it doesn’t provide any significant buffs or utility. I’ve been focusing on building her for a Bloom team, and I find that I often skip her burst entirely to save energy for her skill instead.     Is there a specific scenario where using her burst is beneficial? Maybe in a team composition that I’m not considering? Or is it just better to focus on her skill and let the blooms do the heavy lifting? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

__label__1 I just relapsed after 30 days of nofap, and I’m feeling pretty defeated right now. I was doing so well, and I thought I had it under control. But one moment of weakness and now I’m back to day 0.     I know I shouldn’t be too hard on myself, but it’s tough not to feel like I’ve let myself down. I was experiencing so many benefits during my streak—more energy, better focus, and even improved mood. Now, I feel like I’ve lost all that progress.     I’m trying to remind myself that this is a journey and setbacks happen, but I could really use some encouragement or advice on how to get back on track. How do you all cope with relapses? What strategies do you use to stay motivated? Thanks for any support!
__label__1 Navigating dating apps can be tricky, especially when you're trying to connect with real people instead of bots or scammers. Here are some tips that might help you find genuine connections:    1. **Choose the Right App**: Some dating apps are known for having a higher percentage of real users. Apps like Hinge, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel often focus on meaningful connections rather than just swiping.    2. **Create a Genuine Profile**: Use clear, recent photos of yourself and write a bio that reflects your personality. Avoid generic phrases and instead share something unique about yourself or what you're looking for.    3. **Look for Red Flags**: Be cautious of profiles that have very few photos, overly generic bios, or those that seem too good to be true. If someone asks for personal information or money early on, it's a major red flag.    4. **Engage in Conversation**: When you match with someone, start a conversation that goes beyond small talk. Ask open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer. This can help you gauge their authenticity.    5. **Video Chats**: Suggest a video call before meeting in person. This can help you confirm that the person is who they say they are and can also help you feel more comfortable.    6. **Trust Your Instincts**: If something feels off, don’t hesitate to unmatch or block someone. Your safety and comfort should always come first.    7. **Be Patient**: Finding the right person can take time. Don’t rush into anything and take the time to get to know someone before meeting up.    8. **Report Suspicious Accounts**: If you encounter bots or scammers, report them to the app. This helps keep the community safer for everyone.    By following these tips, you can increase your chances of connecting with real people who are genuinely interested in getting to know you. Good luck!

__label__1 I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I really believe that Lord Zedd could have been an even more compelling main antagonist if he had been given more screen time and development throughout the series.     While Rita Repulsa was iconic and had her moments, Zedd brought a darker, more menacing presence to the show. His powers and abilities were impressive, and he had a unique design that set him apart from other villains. I feel like if the writers had focused more on his backstory and motivations, he could have been a truly unforgettable villain.     Another character that comes to mind is Astronema from Power Rangers in Space. She had such a complex character arc, starting as a villain and eventually becoming a hero. If she had been the main antagonist throughout a longer season, it would have added so much depth to the storyline.     What do you all think? Which villain or henchman do you believe deserved the spotlight as the main antagonist? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 In a battle between Starlight from "The Boys" and Angel from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," we have two very different characters with unique abilities and backgrounds.     Starlight, also known as Annie January, possesses superhuman strength, speed, and durability, along with the ability to manipulate light. She can create blinding flashes, projectiles, and even use her powers to fly. Starlight is also a skilled fighter, having trained in combat, and her moral compass drives her to fight for justice, often putting her in direct conflict with corrupt superheroes.    On the other hand, Angel is a vampire with a soul, which gives him a unique perspective on morality and redemption. He has superhuman strength, speed, and agility, along with enhanced senses and healing abilities. Angel is also a master of hand-to-hand combat and has centuries of experience, making him a formidable opponent. His vampiric abilities allow him to withstand significant damage, and he can regenerate from injuries that would be fatal to a normal human.    In a one-on-one fight, Starlight's light manipulation could give her an edge, especially if she can catch Angel off guard. However, Angel's combat experience and resilience could allow him to withstand her attacks and retaliate effectively. If the fight takes place at night, Angel's vampiric powers would be at their peak, potentially tipping the scales in his favor.    Ultimately, the outcome could depend on the environment and the circumstances of their encounter. If Starlight can utilize her powers strategically and keep the fight in her favor, she might emerge victorious. However, if Angel can close the distance and leverage his combat skills, he could overpower her.     Who do you think would win in this clash of heroes? Let the debate begin!
__label__1 Hey fellow Wastelanders!      I'm on the hunt for some specific apparel in Fallout 76 and could use your help. I'm looking for the following items:    - The Urban Scout Armor    - The Secret Service Armor    - Any of the themed outfits from the Atomic Shop, especially the ones from the Halloween event.      If anyone has tips on where to find these or if you have extras you’re willing to trade, I’d really appreciate it! I’m also open to any suggestions for good locations to farm for rare apparel.      Thanks in advance, and happy exploring!
__label__1 I love being a parent, truly I do, but no one warned me about the sheer exhaustion that comes with it! I mean, I knew it would be hard, but I didn’t realize just how relentless it would be. From the moment my little one wakes up, it’s a whirlwind of demands: breakfast, getting dressed, playtime, and then the inevitable meltdowns over the smallest things.     I also wasn’t prepared for the emotional rollercoaster. One minute, I’m filled with joy watching my child discover something new, and the next, I’m dealing with a tantrum that feels like it’s going to last forever. It’s like I’m on a constant seesaw of happiness and frustration.     And can we talk about the mess? I thought I was a tidy person before becoming a parent, but now my house looks like a tornado hit it. Toys everywhere, crumbs on the floor, and I can’t even remember the last time I had a clean kitchen.     Then there’s the guilt. Oh, the guilt! I feel guilty for wanting a moment to myself, for needing a break, for not being able to give my child my undivided attention every second of the day. I love my child more than anything, but sometimes I just want to sit in silence for five minutes!     I guess what I’m trying to say is that while I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything, I wish someone had been more honest about the challenges. It’s a beautiful journey, but it’s also one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Anyone else feel this way?
__label__1 I just had the most frustrating experience in Apex Legends, and I need to vent. I was in the middle of a ranked match, and my game crashed out of nowhere. I tried to reconnect as fast as I could, but by the time I got back in, I was hit with an abandon penalty.     This has happened to me multiple times now, and I know I’m not alone in this. It’s incredibly frustrating to be penalized for something that’s completely out of my control. I understand that they want to discourage players from leaving matches, but when it’s a technical issue, it feels so unfair.     Can we please consider removing the abandon penalty from all modes when it’s due to connection issues? It’s not like I’m intentionally leaving the game. I want to play and contribute to my team, but these penalties just make it feel like I’m being punished for something I can’t help.     Anyone else feel the same way? What do you think could be a better solution to this issue?

__label__1 I’ve been with my boyfriend for about two years now, and while we have a great relationship overall, there’s one issue that’s been bothering me for a while. He works with a female coworker who he talks to quite frequently, and I can’t shake the feeling that it’s crossing a line.    At first, I tried to be understanding. I know that work relationships can be important, and I trust him. However, it seems like he’s always texting her or bringing her up in conversation. He often mentions how they have lunch together or how they’re working on projects late at the office. I’ve even seen some of their messages when he’s shown me something on his phone, and while they seem friendly, I can’t help but feel uncomfortable about the frequency and the nature of their conversations.    I’ve brought it up to him a couple of times, expressing my feelings of discomfort, but he brushes it off, saying that I’m being insecure and that it’s just work-related. He insists that there’s nothing going on between them and that I shouldn’t worry. I want to believe him, but I can’t help but feel like there’s more to it.     I’ve tried to communicate my feelings without sounding accusatory, but it feels like he doesn’t fully understand where I’m coming from. I don’t want to control who he talks to, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m competing for his attention or that he’s emotionally investing in someone else.     Am I overreacting? How can I approach this situation without causing a rift in our relationship? I really value what we have, but I need to feel secure and respected too.

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I wanted to bring attention to ThreeD Capital (NIRV.CN) as I believe it has some exciting potential in the penny stock arena. For those who may not be familiar, ThreeD Capital is a venture capital firm that focuses on investing in disruptive technologies, particularly in the areas of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.    Recently, they have been making headlines with their strategic investments and partnerships, which could position them well for growth in the coming months. Their portfolio includes some innovative companies that are on the cutting edge of technology, and I think this could lead to significant returns for investors.    Additionally, the stock has been trading at a low price point, which makes it an attractive option for those looking to get in on the ground floor. With the market's increasing interest in tech and innovation, I believe NIRV.CN could see a surge in interest and price appreciation.    I’d love to hear your thoughts on this stock. Has anyone else been following ThreeD Capital? What are your predictions for its performance in the near future? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 Hello all,    I have been trying to install Proxmox VE 7.2 for the last two days but have been unsuccessful. I am new to servers/homelab but trying to learn and this seems to be my first big hurdle.    What I'm using:        Dell PowerEdge R520, 48GB RAM, Xeon E5-2440 v2      8 x 1TB HDD      iDRAC 7      BIOS version:  2.9.0       PERC H310 Mini: 20.13.3-0001      Lifecycle firmware version: 2.65.65.65    I first tried to setup a RAID 5 via the Dell lifecycle controller and then install proxmox using the default settings (ext4) but the installation keeps failing with the message "unable to partition harddisk '/dev/sda' " and sometimes on the black screen I can see a repeated message "PTE read access is not set".    I then read comments about not using a hardware RAID but instead setting it up via Proxmox via ZFS so I deleted my RAID array via the lifecycle controller and again tried but this time selected ZFS RAIDZ1 but it doesn't seem to see any disks.    I have also read comments where people have said don't setup a RAID 0 hardware array and then have ZFS.    I'm also reading stuff about IT mode HBA and to be honest it's all a bit alien to me and I don't really understand what it is or how to configure my server for it.    Could someone point me in the right direction, please?    == EDIT ==      Proxmox 6.4 has installed successfully. Could the issue be that V.7.2 does not like the perc H310 Mini?

__label__1 I've noticed that more and more people are using the phrase "Rest in Power" instead of the traditional "Rest in Peace" when someone passes away, and I'm curious about the reasoning behind this shift.     From what I understand, "Rest in Power" is often used to honor individuals, particularly those who have fought against oppression or injustice, such as activists, marginalized community members, or those who have died in tragic circumstances. It seems to convey a sense of strength and resilience, suggesting that the person's legacy and impact continue to live on, rather than just a peaceful rest.     I’d love to hear from others about their thoughts on this phrase. Do you think it’s a more empowering way to remember someone? Or do you prefer the traditional "Rest in Peace"? What does it mean to you when you see or use "Rest in Power"?

__label__0 I’m playing Three Houses for the first time myself. Previously I watched my wife’s playthrough as the Blue Lions, so I decided to go with the Black Eagles this go around. If there’s any advice on builds y’all think I could benefit from please tell me. However, one thing I absolutely need to know how to do is recruit Lysithea and get her to her little nuke status. When watching the final battle between the three houses in my wife’s playthrough, Lysithea was absolutely wrecking everything she touched and just deleting people from the board. My goal this go is to have Hubert, Edelgard, and Lysithea in their most OP forms then to figure out the best builds for the rest. Any ideas on how to do just that?
__label__1 I don’t even know where to start. I feel like I’ve been fighting this battle for so long, and I’m just so tired. Every day feels like a struggle to get out of bed, to put on a smile, to pretend that everything is okay when it’s not. I used to have dreams and aspirations, but now they feel so far out of reach.     I’ve tried therapy, medication, and all the self-help tips I could find online, but nothing seems to work. I feel like I’m stuck in this never-ending cycle of sadness and hopelessness. I see people around me moving forward with their lives, achieving their goals, and I can’t help but feel like I’m being left behind.     I know I should be grateful for the good things in my life, but it’s hard to see them when I’m drowning in this darkness. I feel like a burden to my friends and family, and I hate that I can’t just snap out of it. I wish I could be the person I used to be, the one who was full of life and laughter.     I’m just so exhausted. I don’t want to fight anymore. I just want to feel at peace, even if that means giving up on everything I once wanted. I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but I just needed to get this off my chest. If you’re struggling too, know that you’re not alone. I’m here, feeling lost and defeated, just like you.
__label__1 Has anyone else experienced issues with DoorDash notifications on their iPhone 12? I’ve noticed that I only get the notification sounds when the app is open. If I’m not actively using the app, I don’t hear anything when an order comes in.     I’ve checked my notification settings and everything seems to be enabled correctly. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. It’s really frustrating because I don’t want to miss out on orders, especially during peak hours.     Is this a common issue with the iPhone 12, or is it just me? Any tips or solutions would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 EDIT:     Wow thank you everyone for your advice!!! This is incredible. I started to digging into the zoning rules, and the different options that people suggested.

ORIG:     I'm not sure if this is the right sub --    A few years ago, a commercial building went up behind my parents' house. They installed an extremely bright flood light which shines into my parents' house. We installed blackout curtains for the bedrooms on that side of the house, but the light still shines into the kitchen and it's blinding at night.    [https://imgur.com/a/ge7q64L](https://imgur.com/a/ge7q64L)    I'd like to ask the property owner if they would be willing to make  adjustments. What would make this light less intrusive?
__label__1 I recently came across the Solis device for OTR (Over The Road) trucking and wanted to get some feedback from you all. It’s a mobile device that claims to help with everything from tracking your hours of service to managing your routes and even providing roadside assistance.     I’ve been using a basic GPS and my phone for navigation and logging, but I’m curious if investing in a dedicated device like the Solis would be worth it. Has anyone here used it? How does it compare to other devices or apps you’ve tried?     I’m particularly interested in how user-friendly it is while driving, the accuracy of the GPS, and if it really helps with compliance and efficiency.     Thanks in advance for your insights!     Edit: I’m currently a solo driver with about 3 years of OTR experience, and I’m always looking for ways to make my job easier and safer.

Does anyone else feel similar? Are you able to be online, enjoy your life and still stay clear from spending time on suggestive pictures that could lead to fapping?
__label__1 I’m trying to find a video that I saw recently, but I can’t remember the details clearly. It might have been a TikTok or a YouTube short, or possibly a scene from a movie.     What I remember is that it features a girl wearing a red dress or outfit, and there’s a guy on a beach. The vibe of the video was quite romantic or emotional. I think there was some kind of interaction between them, possibly a moment of connection or a dramatic scene. The beach setting was beautiful, with waves and maybe a sunset in the background.     I’m not sure if it was a short film or just a clip, but it really stood out to me. If anyone has seen something like this or knows what it might be, I would really appreciate your help!

__label__0 So, for context, me (15f) and my boyfriend (14, soon to be 15, ftm) have been dating for almost 3 years now, maybe almost 4, its hard to decifer as I'm really horrible with dates. We have been best friends since kindergarten, and we are about to go into grade 10, so we've known eachother for around a decade now, including our romantic relationship. The problem is is that...I dont know, its hard to explain. It was both of our first relationships, and we were only around 12/13 at the time we started dating.     So, we were learning. Learning how to..."relationship." For the first year, I tried to, well, I tried to make it romantic. You know, cuddling, holding hands, what you do in a relationship when you're young. But, it was never really, reciprocated that much? He'd let me cuddle him and hold his hand but he never initiated it first, and when he said "I love you too" for the first time I was so ecstatic I genuinely cheered and gushed to my friend because, well, he had never done that before. The problem with this is that I'm a very affectionate person, I need physical and emotional affection, I need/adore cuddles, hand holding, and "I love you"'s a lot, whether our relationship is platonic or romantic, I hold hands with pretty much all my friends, I cuddle them, I tell them I love you and they say it back or tell me it as well. Its how I work.     Even though I wasn't getting that, of course I was in the honeymoon faze. I loved him so much. When covid hit, though, thats when it started taking a turn, and we barely ever talked. Ever. Maybe once a month but even that was a stretch, for 2 years, that happened. And then he started attending school again. It was nice, but the problem was was that I started to realize how....little I was getting from our relationship. In a way that, it was like we were still only friends, but only I was tied down and not allowed to date anyone or be with anyone or have anything romantic.     I realized, that through our entire relationship, we were basically still just friends, just with a different title. We barely ever communicated our relationship, unless it was me starting it because I was desperate for anything other than saying I had a lover when it never even felt like it, and I do take blame for that. Neither of us communicated with eachother. That's probably why this isn't working out, we never ever talked about anything. We just...let it die.     I started to not hang out with my usual group at lunch anymore, I used to tell myself it was because one of them made me really uncomfortable, but then I also started to realize, it was emotionally draining being around that group as a whole. One friend made me super uncomfortable, and the other, my boyfriend, he only ever talked about himself, only him. Never let anyone mention themselves, and it was *draining.* not to mention that we BARELY talk, I havent talked to him in probably over a month, and we barely interacted at school, either. It was even to the point where I had recieved so many comments from people thinking I was dating my best friend yet nobody had even thought of me being in a relationship with my actual partner.    But the final straw, was when he came out as trans. I have no problem with it, I'm actually very proud of him for doing so. I know its hard. My best friend is also a trans man, and I've been helping him through every struggle he's had to face ever since he found out, I know how difficult that would have been for him. The problem is, is that I'm a lesbian. I like women, and this wouldn't even be an issue if he *talked* to me about it. But he didnt. My final straw was that, when he came out, he just announced it to a gc with a bunch of other friends and never once thought to talk to his lesbian gf about it and what that meant for their relationship. I found out at the same time as a bunch of others who weren't in this position, no warning, no conversation. I should have been the one to strike up the conversation, and I'm now regretting that I didn't. I didn't think of it until now. My best friend questioned our relationship in my dms a few minutes later and I then started to feel so horrible, and then later decided that, I think it was time we went back to being friends.    The thing is, is that was....months ago. Probably when there was still a quarter of the year left last year. I'm incredible socially awkward and have really extreme social anxiety, so I kept putting it off, and putting it off, every time I told myself to do it I'd spiral into something of an anxiety attack. I'd had multiple mental breakdowns about because I felt so horrible, and so trapped.     I felt so bad because I felt like I was invalidating him as a trans man, and I also felt bad because, I was so deprived of the romantic attraction I craved that I started falling for a friend of mine that I dont even see often, I was so in love, so starstruck when we hung out and the entire time I was wallowing in so much guilt.    I decided to meet up with him, hang out, and go around town with him, my plan was to be back at the park we were meeting at and break it to him there, but we ran late and by the time we got back there was no time. I even stopped him, but the moment I did I started to shake so severely, I couldn't breathe, I was on the verge of tears, and I backed out. I shook my head and told him that I was just catching my breath for a second. He left, and I went home feeling so guilty. At this point both my mom and my best friend were telling me to break it to him over text, but I googled it and it seemed so horrible to do. Even if I dont like him romantically I still love him as a person and as a friend, I could never hurt him like that. I dont want to be a selfish, immature coward who broke off an almost 3 year long relationship over text, and I most certainly don't want to leave him hurt and confused. But every time I try to break up irl, I spiral so hard into panic that I just can't do it no matter how hard I'm trying. I dont want to lead him on in this endless relationship where we never speak, and I want to he free again. I want a loving gf who I can cuddle and hug and care for, I want *love*, I dont want to feel this way, but I genuinely don't know how to go about it.    Should I follow my best friend and mom's advice and just...do it over text? Or, should I somehow, do it in person? And, if so, how? How should I go across it? Should I prepare like, a speech of sorts?    TL;DR: I no longer want to be in a relationship but I do not know how to break it off with my extreme anxiety
__label__0 Hello, I'm still young so I might miss a few details, but this is something that I have not only been aware of since I was 12 (19 and Male as I type this) but I was constantly questioning myself on My emotions. Or to be more specific, I don't really feel any emotions that much. They feel completely numb to me. Such as love, sadness, a state of genuine happiness, and grief and it eats me up inside.    To the point where I've had an existential crisis a few times from overthinking about it too much. I've thought about asking my parents but I wasn't sure if that would be able to help since the last time I told them It was when I was still at that young age. They pretty much told me that I'm fine and it's likely my hormones as I'm about to hit puberty. At that age I was only a little out of touch with my emotions and I took their advice and dismissed it, but when I hit puberty as the years went on I felt so dead inside that it took me going to my dad after he was diagnosed with leukemia for it to click that I wasn't panicked or stressed about it at all. I didn't cry, I didn't feel sadness, or fear over the fact that I might lose him. I felt nothing.    I just had an existential crisis to the point that I was hyperventilating and my mom and father figure basically thought I was taking it worse then my little brother took it. but it really was just a moment of emotional confusion that escalated quickly. I never told them due to me having problems with me speaking out about my emotions. I found this subreddit after I saw a recommended post from here. I looked through some of the posts And I thought to maybe vent this out and possibly get some answers.    Is this a sort of emotional disorder or something?     Or is there just something up with my emotions in general and I'm just overthinking it too much?

__label__1 The verse from 1 John 4:1 serves as a crucial reminder for Christians to be discerning about the teachings and influences we encounter in our faith journey. When it says to "test the spirits," it emphasizes the importance of evaluating the messages we receive, whether they come from preachers, books, or even personal revelations.    Testing the spirits involves several key aspects:    1. **Alignment with Scripture**: One of the primary ways to test a spirit is to see if its message aligns with the teachings of the Bible. God's Word is our ultimate authority, and any teaching that contradicts Scripture should be approached with caution. This means not only checking for direct quotes but also ensuring that the overall message is consistent with biblical principles.    2. **The Fruit of the Spirit**: In Galatians 5:22-23, we learn about the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. A message or spirit that promotes these qualities is likely from God, while one that leads to division, fear, or confusion may not be.    3. **The Character of Christ**: We should also consider whether the spirit reflects the character of Jesus. Does it promote humility, service, and love for others? If a teaching elevates self over Christ or encourages behavior contrary to Christ's example, it may be a false spirit.    4. **Community Discernment**: Engaging with fellow believers can provide additional insight. The body of Christ is meant to support and hold each other accountable. Discussing teachings with trusted friends or leaders can help clarify whether something is truly of God.    5. **Prayer and Guidance**: Finally, seeking the Holy Spirit's guidance through prayer is essential. God promises to give wisdom to those who ask (James 1:5). If we are genuinely seeking truth, He will help us discern what is from Him and what is not.    In conclusion, testing the spirits is not just about checking for alignment with Scripture but involves a holistic approach that includes examining the fruit produced, the character of Christ, community input, and prayerful discernment. In a world filled with various teachings and influences, this practice is vital for maintaining a faithful walk with God.

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m looking to set up a humid hide for my leopard gecko and wanted to get some advice on the best way to do it. I’ve read that it’s important for their shedding process and overall health, but I’m not quite sure what materials to use or how to set it up effectively.     I currently have a basic setup with a few hides, but I want to make sure the humid hide is just right. I’ve seen some people use moss, while others recommend using damp paper towels or coconut fiber. What do you all think is the best option?     Also, how often should I be replacing the substrate in the humid hide? I want to make sure it stays clean and doesn’t develop any mold or bacteria.     Any tips on maintaining the humidity levels would also be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 I think I saw this in the last couple of years and believe it was on a major streaming service.    It starts with a guy who I think used to be a cop but now does PI work. He’s trying to find some older Asian women find her daughter (maybe)?    He tracks the teenager down to some city where teenagers are making money from a mobile phone game that interacts with the real world and encourages them to solve puzzles.    I think some company is then experimenting on people while they are dreaming?    And a women who was involved in the experiments hiding in a cabin in the woods? The PI or someone finds her by posting her a book?    Then there’s an evil black house where the rooms keep changing.    This one is bugging me as I can clearly picture certain scenes but have no idea what it is.    I’m about to go to bed so be patient if it gets solved while I am asleep. Thanks for your help in advance.
__label__1 I've been thinking a lot about my future lately and whether I should stay in the UK or consider moving abroad. I love my home country, but I can't help but feel a bit disillusioned with some aspects of life here, like the cost of living, the weather, and the political climate.     On the other hand, I have a stable job and a good support network of friends and family. I know that moving to another country comes with its own set of challenges, like finding a job, adjusting to a new culture, and being away from loved ones.     For those of you who have made the leap to move abroad, what was your experience like? Do you think it was worth it? And for those who have chosen to stay in the UK, what keeps you here? I'm really torn and would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 Cooking and culinary shows have become increasingly popular in many European countries, each with its own unique flavor and style. In the UK, for instance, shows like "MasterChef" and "The Great British Bake Off" have not only garnered massive viewership but have also sparked a nationwide interest in home cooking and baking. The latter, in particular, has become a cultural phenomenon, with viewers eagerly anticipating each season and often trying out the recipes at home.    In France, culinary shows are a staple of television, reflecting the country's rich gastronomic heritage. Programs like "Top Chef" and "MasterChef France" attract millions of viewers, showcasing both professional chefs and amateur cooks. The emphasis on high-quality ingredients and traditional techniques resonates deeply with the French audience, who take great pride in their culinary culture.    Italy also has a vibrant cooking show scene, with programs like "MasterChef Italia" and various regional cooking competitions that highlight local ingredients and traditional recipes. The passion for food is palpable, and these shows often inspire viewers to explore their own culinary skills, leading to a resurgence in home cooking.    In Germany, cooking shows have gained traction as well, with formats that often blend entertainment with education. Shows like "The Taste" and "Grill den Profi" not only showcase cooking techniques but also engage viewers with competitive elements, making them more appealing to a broader audience.    Overall, cooking and culinary shows are not just popular; they have become a significant part of the cultural landscape in many European countries, encouraging people to connect with food, experiment in the kitchen, and appreciate the art of cooking.
__label__1 I've been experimenting with virtual monitors in VR and wanted to share my experience and get some feedback from the community.     I recently set up a virtual desktop environment using my Oculus Quest 2 and a few different apps like Virtual Desktop and Bigscreen. The idea of having multiple virtual monitors in a 3D space is incredibly appealing, especially for productivity and multitasking.     Here are some of my thoughts:  1. **Immersive Experience**: Being able to have multiple screens floating in front of me while I work or watch videos is a game-changer. It feels like I have an entire office setup in my living room.  2. **Customization**: I love how I can customize the size and position of each virtual monitor. It allows me to create a workspace that feels comfortable and tailored to my needs.  3. **Performance**: I did notice some lag when streaming high-resolution content, especially if I had multiple monitors open at once. It seems like the performance can vary based on the app and my Wi-Fi connection.  4. **Eye Strain**: I’ve also experienced some eye strain after long sessions. I’m not sure if it’s due to the VR headset itself or the way I’m using the virtual monitors, but it’s something to keep in mind.  5. **Use Cases**: I’ve found it particularly useful for coding and watching tutorials while working on projects. The ability to have a browser open alongside my code editor is fantastic.    Overall, I think virtual monitors in VR have a lot of potential, especially for those who work from home or need a flexible workspace. I’d love to hear if anyone else has tried this and what your experiences have been. Any tips for reducing eye strain or improving performance would also be appreciated!
__label__0 I just posted pics of my new to me Lexus here last week. After a week of driving, I’ve come to get to know the vehicle a bit better but I need some answers/advice from long time Lexus owners. Hope you guys can help.     For reference car has 230,000 Kms or about 143,000 miles     1. Door locks. I purchased the car knowing that only the passenger front door locks and unlocks with the key fob or the inside button. All other locks have to be toggled manually. Previous owner says it’s the actuators… I just find it hard to believe that all three would go out at once - unless they went out one at a time without him fixing any of it - but regardless of when, to have 3 actuators go bad on a vehicle is unheard of to me. Any idea what’s going on? Some have told me the actuators tend to be a weak point in these… any truth to it?  Could it be electrical?      2. I tried to program the memory seats, set button beeped once I then pressed 1, but it did not set the memory. I’ve never heard the beep again no matter how many times I press set. Did the switch just fry?       3. According to the seller they haven’t driven the car much or nearly at all since Covid started. Means they drove it from year 1-9 but haven’t all the way through year 12. When I was taking the car home the first time the tpms light came on. Figured no biggie. Probably just needs air. Turns out all tires were OVERinflated. I corrected it and set all tires to 30 psi as per the door sticker but tpms light did not go away. It tends to blink for about a minute when the car starts the. Stays steady the rest of the time. Bad sensors?       4. Happened just once. Ac did not turn on when the car was started. Just a bug?      5. Noticed blower motor fan is noisy. Is this about the time to be doing a replacement?       Any and all help much appreciated guys. I love the car and I hope I can bring it back to its former glory before the end of the summer.
__label__1 When it comes to job applications, there can be a significant difference between applying directly to a company on your own and having a senior recruiter reach out to you on LinkedIn and encourage you to apply. Here are some key distinctions:    1. **Visibility and Attention**: When you apply directly to a company, your application may go into a large pool of candidates, and it might not get the attention it deserves. However, if a senior recruiter is advocating for you, your application is likely to be prioritized. Recruiters often have established relationships with hiring managers, which can give your application a boost.    2. **Tailored Guidance**: A recruiter can provide insights into the company culture, the specific role, and what the hiring team is looking for. This information can help you tailor your resume and cover letter more effectively than if you were applying on your own.    3. **Networking Opportunities**: When a recruiter reaches out to you, it often means they see potential in your background and skills. This can open doors for networking opportunities within the company or industry that you might not have had access to otherwise.    4. **Feedback and Support**: Recruiters can offer feedback on your application and interview performance, which can be invaluable in improving your chances of landing the job. They can also help you navigate the interview process and prepare you for what to expect.    5. **Job Market Insights**: Recruiters are often well-versed in the job market and can provide insights into salary expectations, job trends, and what skills are currently in demand. This information can help you make more informed decisions about your career path.    6. **Less Competition**: If a recruiter is specifically reaching out to you, it may indicate that they are looking for a candidate with your specific skill set, which could mean less competition compared to a general application process.    In summary, while applying directly to a company is a valid approach, having a senior recruiter encourage you to apply can significantly enhance your chances of getting noticed and ultimately hired. If you have the opportunity to connect with a recruiter, it’s worth taking advantage of their expertise and support.
__label__1 I (28F) recently started dating someone (30M) and things have been going really well. We have great chemistry, enjoy each other's company, and have similar values. However, I've noticed that he sometimes seems distant or less communicative, especially when it comes to discussing feelings or future plans.     I’m a very open person and I like to talk about where things are headed, but he tends to avoid those conversations. When I bring it up, he often says he’s just not used to talking about feelings or that he’s not ready to define things yet.     I’m starting to feel a bit confused and anxious about what this means for us. I really like him and want to see where this goes, but I’m worried that his reluctance to open up might indicate that he’s not as invested as I am.     I’ve tried to be patient and give him space, but I also don’t want to waste my time if he’s not on the same page. I’m considering having a more direct conversation about my feelings and where I see this relationship going, but I’m unsure if that would push him away or help clarify things.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do you navigate a situation where one person is more open about their feelings than the other? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been diving into the world of online income lately, and I wanted to share some insights on how to make money online for free. With the current market volatility, especially with AMC, it's crucial to have multiple streams of income. Here are a few methods I've found effective:    1. **Surveys and Market Research**: Websites like Swagbucks and Survey Junkie allow you to earn money by sharing your opinions. It’s not a lot, but it adds up over time.    2. **Freelancing**: If you have a skill like writing, graphic design, or programming, platforms like Fiverr and Upwork can help you find clients. You can start with no upfront costs and build your portfolio.    3. **Affiliate Marketing**: If you have a blog or a social media following, you can promote products and earn a commission for every sale made through your referral link. Amazon Associates is a great place to start.    4. **Selling Unused Items**: Platforms like eBay or Facebook Marketplace allow you to sell items you no longer need. It’s a quick way to declutter and make some cash.    5. **Content Creation**: If you enjoy making videos or writing, consider starting a YouTube channel or a blog. While it takes time to monetize, the potential earnings can be significant.    6. **Online Tutoring**: If you excel in a particular subject, consider tutoring students online. Websites like Chegg Tutors can connect you with students in need of help.    Remember, while these methods can help you earn some extra cash, they require time and effort. Stay focused, and don’t forget to keep holding AMC! 🚀💎🙌
__label__1 I just finished reading a romance novel featuring a blue-collar male main character who is the absolute definition of a cinnamon roll, and I can't stop thinking about it!     The story revolves around a hardworking mechanic named Jake, who is not only skilled with cars but also has the biggest heart. He’s the kind of guy who would drop everything to help a friend in need or rescue a stray animal. His kindness and gentle nature make him incredibly endearing, and I found myself rooting for him from the very first chapter.     The love interest, a strong-willed woman named Mia, is trying to save her family’s struggling bakery. Their chemistry is electric, and I loved how Jake supported her dreams while also dealing with his own insecurities about not being ‘good enough’ for her. The way he treats her with respect and admiration is just so refreshing!     There are some really sweet moments where he surprises her with little gestures, like fixing her car for free or baking her favorite cookies after a long day. It’s the perfect blend of romance and slice-of-life, and I couldn’t help but smile through the entire book.     If anyone is looking for a feel-good romance with a blue-collar hero who is a total sweetheart, I highly recommend checking this one out! What are some of your favorite books with cinnamon roll MMCs? I’d love to add more to my TBR!
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I'm curious to hear about the hardware setups that you all are using for high-performance production environments with Proxmox. As I look to upgrade my own homelab, I want to ensure that I make informed decisions based on real-world experiences.    Here’s what I’m currently considering:  - **CPU**: I’m leaning towards AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon processors, as they seem to offer great multi-threading capabilities and performance for virtualization.  - **RAM**: I’m thinking of going with at least 128GB of ECC RAM to ensure stability and performance, especially for running multiple VMs.  - **Storage**: I’m interested in NVMe SSDs for the OS and critical VMs, and possibly a combination of SATA SSDs and HDDs for bulk storage. I’ve heard good things about using ZFS for its snapshot and replication features.  - **Networking**: A 10GbE network card seems like a must for high throughput, especially if I plan to run multiple VMs that require significant bandwidth.    I’d love to hear what you all are using! What hardware do you find works best for your Proxmox setups? Any recommendations or lessons learned from your experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 Gale got into meth cooking because he believed that there will always be a demand for meth, and if that is the case, he might as well give the best,purest, and most healthiest product there is, to at least reduce the damage there would otherwise be.    &amp;#x200B;    When compared to other people like, Walt, Saul, or cartel members, is he any better, more pure, better as a person? Or is he just as terrible as the rest.    &amp;#x200B;    Edit; Could it also be that Gus manipulated him into thinking this way?
__label__1 /r/worldnews      https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67012345      Colombia is witnessing a surge in protests following the tragic death of a man who was tasered by police during an altercation. The incident, which occurred in the city of Medellín, has ignited widespread outrage and led to violent clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Protesters are demanding accountability and justice, claiming that excessive force was used by the police.     As tensions escalate, reports indicate that at least three people have died in the ensuing violence, with many more injured. The government has called for calm, but the situation remains volatile as citizens express their frustration over police brutality and systemic issues within the law enforcement agencies.     This incident adds to a growing list of similar cases in Colombia, where public trust in the police has been severely eroded. Activists are urging for reforms to ensure that such tragedies do not happen again, while the international community watches closely as the situation unfolds.
__label__0 I have been to multiple protests. Abortion. Union. Nurse wage. You name it. I have been there.     Abortion is outlawed.  Union contract is nullified.  Wages are the same.    Nothing ever change.     I feel so distrust on the current government. So pointless.     Whenever I participate a protest, I am grateful for sure that I have the right to, but I know in the end, nothing will change.     Could someone please give me a word of encouragement?
__label__0 I've been feeling that for years. FOMO. Extreme conformity. Anti-individualistic mindset. Always wanting to fit in regardless of where I live and go. It's been hard for me and the more the think about it, the more I feel upset.    What I'm trying to say is to clarify: Have you ever had a stage in your life where you didn't get to do things everyone else did and want to experience them before you get too old?

__label__1 I was never a shy person, but social anxiety crept up on me after I got this really bad haircut back in 7th grade in 2017. I remember walking into school that day, feeling somewhat confident, but then I got roasted by my classmates. The laughter and comments hit me hard, and it felt like my self-esteem took a nosedive.     Fast forward five years, and I still struggle with social anxiety. It’s frustrating because I used to be outgoing and enjoyed being around people. Now, I find myself overthinking every interaction, worrying about what others might think of me.     I’ve tried therapy in the past, but I’m not going back. I want to overcome this on my own. I’ve started to challenge myself by putting myself in social situations, even if it’s just small gatherings. I remind myself that everyone has their insecurities, and most people are too caught up in their own lives to judge me as harshly as I fear they do.     I guess I’m just sharing to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. How did you cope with social anxiety that stemmed from a specific event? Any tips on how to keep pushing through? Thanks for reading!

__label__0 The catfished stemmed from an overlong lack of confidence and uncomfortable in my own skin. Creating a false I-wish-I-am-this persona was a way to cope up with it, but I never thought I would fall for someone online. I'm in a happy relationship now, slowly accepting who I am but I would still think of him in passing. To that Finnish guy I met in OtakuZone, I hope you're doing great wherever you are and I'm sorry for tricking you.

For example, I have a table with the following columns:   - Product   - Sales   - Region     The data looks something like this:    | Product | Sales | Region |  |---------|-------|--------|  | A       | 100   | North  |  | B       | 150   | South  |  | A       | 200   | North  |  | C       | 300   | East   |  | B       | 100   | South  |    I want to create a summary that combines the sales for each product across all regions. The desired output would look like this:    | Product | Total Sales |  |---------|-------------|  | A       | 300         |  | B       | 250         |  | C       | 300         |    Could someone guide me on how to achieve this? I’ve tried using the SUMIF function, but I’m not sure how to set it up correctly for multiple entries. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Today is my birthday and I’m super excited! 🎉 I just turned 17 and it feels amazing. I’ve got some friends coming over later for a small party, and we’re planning to binge-watch some movies and eat a ton of snacks.     I also got a new phone as a gift, which I’ve been wanting for ages! I can’t wait to take some cool pics and share them with you all.     What do you guys usually do for your birthdays? Any fun traditions or ideas? I’d love to hear about them!
__label__1 I was scrolling through some fan art and came across an incredible piece that depicted a scene of the Justice League standing together against a backdrop of a cosmic battle. It got me thinking: do you think we'll ever see something like this in the DCEU?     With the recent developments in the DCEU, especially with the multiverse concept being explored in films like "The Flash" and the upcoming "Aquaman" sequel, it seems like the door is wide open for epic team-ups and visually stunning sequences. Imagine a scene where the entire League, including characters like Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter, unite against a cosmic threat like Darkseid or Brainiac.     The potential for jaw-dropping visuals and character dynamics is immense. We’ve seen glimpses of this in Zack Snyder’s "Justice League" with the epic final battle, but I feel like there’s so much more that could be done with the right direction and budget.     What do you all think? Are there any specific shots or scenes you would love to see in the DCEU that would capture that epic, larger-than-life feel? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 Since I found the solution that worked for me, I wanted to post this so it's captured somewhere.     **Issue:** My mazda 3 was not driven very much the past few years and the battery fully died many times. After I got a new battery I noticed the auto up/down feature for drivers window stopped working. Window still went up and down it just didn't do the auto open/close.       **Solution**:     1. Hold down the open window button till the window fully opens, then continue holding for an additional 5 seconds.   2. Close the window all the way and continue holding for an additional 5 seconds    This seemed to fix my issue so hopefully this helps someone else!
__label__1 I recently started exploring my identity through art, and I wanted to share some of the pieces I've created that represent different aspects of who I am. Each picture reflects a part of my journey in the LGBTQ+ community, from embracing my true self to celebrating love and acceptance.    Art has always been a powerful outlet for me, and I find that expressing myself visually helps me process my feelings and experiences. I would love to hear your thoughts on these pieces, and if anyone else has used art as a way to explore their identity, I’d love to see your work too! Let's celebrate our stories together!
__label__1 I need some advice on how to handle a situation with my ex-boyfriend. We broke up a few months ago after dating for about a year. I (22F) ended things because I felt like he was becoming increasingly controlling and it was affecting my mental health. He is 37 and I thought we had a good connection, but as time went on, I realized that our values and life goals were not aligned.    Since the breakup, he has been on what feels like a personal vendetta against me. At first, he tried to convince me to get back together, sending me long messages about how he’s changed and how much he misses me. When I didn’t respond positively, he turned angry. He started posting passive-aggressive things on social media, making it clear he was talking about me without naming me. He’s also reached out to mutual friends, trying to paint me in a bad light and make them choose sides.    I’ve tried to ignore him and focus on my own life, but it’s hard not to feel affected by his actions. I’m worried that he might escalate things further, especially since he has a tendency to be dramatic. I’ve considered blocking him on social media and cutting off contact completely, but I’m also concerned about how that might provoke him even more.    Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? I want to move on with my life without feeling like I’m constantly looking over my shoulder.

__label__1 I've been on a weight loss journey for a while now, and it's been a game changer for my style! I used to struggle to find clothes that fit well and looked good on me, but as I've shed some pounds, I've noticed a huge difference in how clothing fits and flatters my body.     I wanted to share some tips for anyone else who might be in a similar situation:    1. **Tailoring is Key**: Even if you're losing weight, getting your clothes tailored can make a world of difference. A well-fitted piece can elevate your entire look.    2. **Invest in Basics**: As your body changes, having a solid collection of basic pieces that can be mixed and matched is essential. Think quality t-shirts, jeans, and jackets that can adapt to your changing size.    3. **Experiment with Styles**: Don't be afraid to try new styles as you lose weight. What looked good on you before might not be the same now, so have fun exploring different cuts and fits.    4. **Stay True to Your Style**: While it's great to adapt to your new body, make sure you still wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable. Your personal style should always shine through.    5. **Celebrate Your Progress**: As you lose weight, take the time to celebrate your achievements with new clothing that reflects your hard work. It’s a great way to boost your confidence!    I’d love to hear from others who have gone through similar experiences. What changes have you made to your wardrobe during your weight loss journey? Any favorite pieces or brands that you recommend? Let’s share some inspiration!
__label__0 I’ve had this problem for a while now, and it keeps preventing me from playing my favorite games on my TV or Bed where I like to spend a lot of time at.    I mainly play games that revolve  around shooting or aiming, so if your a PC gamer, you’d want to be and precise as possible. So, why not use a keyboard and mouse?    I have wireless variants of keyboards and mouses, but they are a struggle to setup and use. On a couch, you’d need sort of base to prop up the keyboard and the mouse, then you would need to sit in a specific upright position on the seat, and etc. Or you would either need to sit up on a bed and use some sort of stand to bring up a laptop and mouse on your lap.     But with a controller, you can lie down, sit at any angle, and have a relatively low carbon footprint of space occupied.    As you know, aiming on a controller sucks, and isn’t a optimal option compared to a keyboard and mouse for an FPS game.    Has anyone found a fusion of some sort of device that has the accuracy of a keyboard and mouse but the practicality and portability of a normal controller?    Something that you can hold in your two hands. You know especially when you try to aim on a controller, for me specifically, when trying to go back and aim on PC, my muscle memory gets off place, and it just sucks.    I know one option is like a steam controller, but I have heard some really mixed reviews about it.    You guys have any links or ideas?    Edit: Ok, it looks like I should make something clear. I have a 85 inch tv and a couch where I am able to lay down at. I stream my pc to my phone with a controller attached to it to play on a bed.    Edit 8/5/22: You’ve guys tried your best on helping and giving me some decent suggestions. But for my use case scenario, I think I’m gonna pull the trigger on getting a steam controller. I’ve done some more research on it and figured out that using gyro and the trackpad can be really comfortable and precise for gaming.  I’ll update you guys on how I feel about it once I get it and use it.
__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of discussions about veterans aiming for a 100% disability rating from the VA, and I wanted to get some insights on this. Is there a specific goal or reason why so many veterans strive to reach that 100% mark?     From what I understand, achieving 100% can provide a range of benefits, including higher monthly compensation, access to additional healthcare services, and even educational benefits for dependents. But I’m curious if there are other motivations or personal reasons that drive veterans to pursue this goal.     For those of you who have reached 100%, what was your journey like? Did you face any challenges along the way? And for those still working towards it, what are your strategies or tips?     I appreciate any insights you can share!
__label__0 Okay, before i procrastinate even further, [BIG THANK YOU goes to these awesome peeps!](https://imgur.com/jkzCszG)    u/thecaledonianrose Thank you for the Sliding Sands Trail from Hawaii National Park postcard. Looking at the view, i sometimes wish here had these kind of landscapes instead of the rainforest, cause it's trecherous to hike in the rainforest. Thanks for the interesting info about the flower and the color that identifies where in Hawaii it's inhibited.    u/caknuck Thank you for the Modern Art Museum, Forth Worth postcard. I hope you have received my card, or it's well on it's way. I have never heard of Whataburger, is it only in Texas? Kids under 18 are not allowed to work here, or else, i really want my boys to learn and feel what it's like working, cause they have been pampered severely by their grandparents.    u/silvertlc Thank you for the Minnesota postcard. 97F is way hotter than here, but here even rain it's still consistent with the temp, also we have to face this hot weather all year round living near the equator. I am most def a fish eater, next to seafood and meat. For freshwater fish, it depends on the fish though. I have alot of culturally, touristy everything in between of Malaysia, if you'd like to trade up, but i prefer to write on the postcard and send 1 by 1, sending in an envelope is hella expensive! But then again i can add in maybe 5 postcards inside, but it'll take time for me to write all 5 postcards to send in lumpsum, cause i only write during the weekend if i'm free.    u/ninajyang  Thank you for the Hawaii city lights postcard. For some reason, i always pictured Hawaii is this beachy non city like state (dunno why). Aww i hope the bluesy sadness has washed away by now, and yellow has taken over.    u/libertyprogrammer x 2 Thank you for the Elvis Presley/Graceland postcards also the stickers! I always wanted to get these aside from just looking on Google. Truly appreciate the fun facts about Elvis Presly. I grew up listening to Elvis Presley, thanks to my dad he has some cool record collections like the Beatles, MJ he brought back when he was travelling around the world when he was a Uni student/before he married my mom.    u/losewitheloquence Thank you for the handmade butterfly card. I super love butterflies and the pastel colors, i'm glad i got it! Actually it does remind me abit of my wedding invite, but it'll be horrendous to handmake them since during my wedding, we invited 1000 people (not including the guests families if any).    u/RaspberryPoppySeed x 2 Thank you for the Canada Day themes cards and stickers! I think this is my 1st ever and so cool! Holy crap, i was looking through a local online store (similar like Amazon but for locals only) for those maple cookies, and no one sells it!! Now i need to see if they sell Naaimo bars kit, but i think they don't, the only Canadian thing i can find here is Maple Syrup and they are hella expensive. Send my regards to Kenny the lumberjack lol.    u/Stephkempf Anothe great card from you, thank you the 4th of July card. It's same like here on Independence end of this month, we just watch fireworks that the city lights up, if you're up to it, watch the national parade and that's it. Normally there is a concert to wait for midnight, but since Covid there's still not that many big events held here.    u/DPClamavi x 3 Thank you for the handmade washi card and extra touristy postcards from your country. I like Red, maybe because i'm a LEO. I easily get distracted or attracted to Red colors or any bright colors actually. I even collect Red shoes, this started when i watched the 1st time ever an American movie called The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy rubby slippers. I wished Malaysia cards have these really quality prints  postcard, Normandie was a place WW took place if i'm not mistaken? The houses on the postcards, has a similar vibe I can see if i go to Cameron Highlands and Fraser Hill, has that colonial vibe.    u/sparklyrk x 4 Oh wow, thank you for all the cards and freebies inside! I will def use this for postcrossing, since my cards are mostly touristy and has a specifiv theme to it, it's nice to get something else that i  don't have in my collection to use. I super love the handmade card, even it's just stickers and a tag but the placement really suits it.     Terima Kasih everyone!
__label__1 As we gear up for the upcoming arc in My Hero Academia, I can't help but think about how the first exam at U.A. set the stage for so many character developments and rivalries. Remember how intense the practical exams were? The way the students had to showcase their quirks under pressure really highlighted their growth and determination.    I loved seeing how each character approached the challenges differently. For instance, Bakugo's aggressive strategy contrasted sharply with Midoriya's more analytical approach. It was also a great moment for characters like Uraraka and Iida to shine, showing that teamwork and strategy can be just as important as raw power.    What were your favorite moments from the first exam? Do you think any of the characters would handle it differently if they had a second chance? Let's discuss!      Also, with the new season coming up, I wonder how the exams will evolve. Will we see new challenges that test their growth even further? Can't wait to hear your thoughts!
__label__0 This is going to be an odd post. But I had a dream about Sonic Frontiers last night — the catch is, I’ve never seen anything from this game prior and I wouldn’t even consider myself a Sonic fan.     I’m recently coming off COVID, so sleeping has been tough with a bit of a bad cough and post nasal drip causing issues.     Last night I wasn’t feeling great and kept having wild dreams — one of the dreams was for this Sonic game. It felt like a fever dream. It was an open world Sonic game, and I remember absolutely no matter what I did I could not get Sonic to control properly to do what they were asking me to do. The task was almost like a puzzle in an open world, kind of like Horizon Zero Dawns Tall Necks but for Sonic. But the camera and controls for trying to move Sonic were so bad for this challenge it just felt impossible. Everytime I failed an arcadey Japanese voice would repeat the same 2 lines about me failing or “start again”.    I know Sonic Frontiers was announced but I haven’t seen a single thing on it, in months. And I certainly haven’t kept up with it.     Is it a bad omen? Did I see into the future? Who knows. But I thought I would tell you guys about this interesting little adventure from last night.

__label__1 I've noticed that sometimes when I'm listening to music, a particular part of a song can give me chills or goosebumps. It might be a powerful vocal performance, a sudden change in melody, or an emotional lyric that really resonates with me. I find it fascinating, but I’m curious about why this happens.     Is it just a personal emotional response, or is there a scientific explanation behind it? What’s going on in our brains or bodies when we experience these chills? Are there specific elements in music that tend to trigger this reaction more than others?     I’d love to hear your thoughts or any insights you might have!

__label__1 As a low elo player, I've been feeling the impact of the recent jungle and support minion gold nerfs, especially when I find myself paired with a troll in my games. It’s frustrating enough to deal with a teammate who isn’t contributing, but now with the reduced gold income from minions, it feels like the game is even more punishing.    In lower ranks, where coordination and teamwork are often lacking, every bit of gold counts. As a jungler, if my laners are not playing well or are intentionally feeding, I rely on that extra gold from minions to help me scale and make plays. The nerfs mean that I have to work even harder to catch up, and it feels like a double whammy when I’m already dealing with a troll.    Support players are in a similar boat. With the reduced gold from minions, it’s harder to build the necessary items to help carry the game or even just to keep the ADC alive. When you have a troll ADC who refuses to cooperate, it’s even more disheartening to see your gold income drop, making it feel like you’re fighting an uphill battle.    I understand that these changes were likely made to balance the game, but in low elo, where players are still learning and often struggle with basic mechanics, these nerfs can feel like a death sentence when you’re already at a disadvantage. It would be great to see some adjustments or compensations for low elo players to help mitigate the effects of these changes.     What do you all think? Have you felt the same pain in your games? How do you cope with the added pressure of these nerfs when you have a troll on your team?
__label__1 I just got the best haircut of my life and I had to share it with you all! After years of struggling with my curly hair, I finally found a stylist who truly understands how to work with my texture. I went in with a lot of anxiety because I've had some bad experiences in the past, but this time was different.    I showed her some inspiration photos of what I was looking for, and she took the time to really listen to my concerns about volume and shape. She used the curly girl method and cut my hair dry, which made such a difference in how the curls fell. I walked out with layers that enhance my natural curl pattern without losing too much length.     The best part? She gave me tips on how to maintain my curls at home, including the right products to use and how to style them without frizz. I feel like I can finally embrace my curls instead of fighting against them!     Has anyone else had a transformative haircut experience? I’d love to hear your stories!

__label__1 I've been working out for a while now, and I've noticed that my calves have become quite muscular. While I appreciate the strength, I'm looking to slim them down a bit for aesthetic reasons.     I've read that reducing muscle size can be achieved through a combination of lower weight training, higher repetitions, and focusing on cardio. However, I'm unsure about the best approach to specifically target my calves.     Here are a few questions I have:  1. Should I completely avoid calf exercises, or is there a way to modify them to prevent further muscle growth?  2. What types of cardio are most effective for reducing calf size?   3. Are there any dietary changes I should consider to help with this process?    Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 After you take the decision to map the Western Frontier, an event pops up that lets you choose one of 3 characters in your country to lead the expedition, all of them either a general or an admiral. While they are on the expedition, they are considered "busy", meaning you can't mobilize them and they don't participate in any other events.    &gt;Aside: The Western Frontier event chain itself kinda sucks, honestly. Every so often you'll get a popup that lets you choose how the expedition goes, and most choices are between either stalling or a random chance to either "progress" or put the expedition in "peril". The expedition ends when either 8 progress points or 8 peril points have been attained, seemingly with a bias towards peril (at least one decision gets you both a progress and a peril point). It's not really possible to influence the success of the mission. What's more, sometimes when the event ticks, you don't even get a popup and a choice - you'll just gain a set amount of progress and peril points. Real big pain in the ass, there's a mission that involves either mapping the frontier or going to war with British Columbia (I don't remember what exactly the reward was), but it sucked enough to complete the mapping that I just decided to fight Canada and GB rather than do the event.    If you don't care to read that big wall of text, the important upshot is that the expedition can fail. Sometimes, when the expedition fails, *the character you sent on it remains busy*. I noticed this a little while after I gave up on the mission. I'd sent a general, it failed as usual, I said fuck it I'm not doing this again, and went on with my campaign. Some time later I went to war, and discovered I couldn't mobilize the guy. I had a suspicion it was connected to the mission chain but I couldn't say for sure.    Then, fast forward a few in-game decades, I've annexed all of Canada and puppeted most of South America. I'm not really doing much else, so I decide for the hell of it to try the expedition one more time. The original guy was obviously unavailable, so I chose someone else, and miracle of miracles, he actually succeeded! He comes back from the expedition... except he doesn't. The original guy, who'd been busy all this time, now 100+ years old, eating up 75 battalions I couldn't do anything with unless I hired more generals in his HQ to peel them off him, finally makes his return. And, being 100+ years old, immediately dies. And now the guy who *completed* the expedition is busy forever.    This doesn't always happen when you fail the expedition as far as I can tell, and it's not really "game breaking" (like I said, I'd made significant progress without that guy and his 75 battalions because having access to an entire continent makes America's economic potential totally busted), but it is pretty annoying to just lose access to one of your military leaders and a chunk of your troops forever. It's an annoying thing that can sometimes occur after an annoying event chain.
__label__1 I just checked Netflix and noticed that all the seasons of Rick and Morty seem to be gone! I was planning to binge-watch the series this weekend, and now I'm left scrambling.

__label__1 I recently started using the 9anime app on my phone, and I have to say, it's been a game changer for my anime-watching experience! The interface is super user-friendly, and I love how easy it is to find new series and keep track of what I'm currently watching.     However, I did run into a couple of issues. Sometimes the app crashes when I try to load a new episode, and I’ve noticed that the video quality can vary quite a bit depending on the series. Has anyone else experienced these problems?     Also, I’d love to hear any tips or tricks you all have for getting the most out of the app. Are there any hidden features I should know about? Let’s share our experiences!
__label__1 I've been doing some digging into the current political climate and the ongoing discussions surrounding President Biden and his son Hunter. It seems odd that despite all the allegations of influence peddling and questionable business dealings, there hasn't been a serious push for impeachment or a thorough investigation.     What if the reason behind this is more sinister than we think? What if Biden and Hunter are not just your average politicians and businessmen, but are actually tied to the CIA in some capacity?     Think about it: the CIA has a long history of involvement in foreign affairs and influence operations. If Biden and his son were indeed working with or for the CIA, it would make sense that any investigations into their activities would be swept under the rug. After all, the agency has a vested interest in maintaining its operations and protecting its assets.     This could explain why mainstream media seems to downplay the severity of the allegations against them. If they are indeed connected to the intelligence community, it would be in the best interest of those in power to keep that information hidden.     Could it be that the lack of accountability is a result of a larger cover-up? Are we witnessing a classic case of "the deep state" protecting its own? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this theory. Are we looking at a potential CIA operation right under our noses?

Thank you so much for helping me achieve a goal ive had for years. For anyone who’s tried to join and been denied, KEEP TRYING! With enough hard work and dedication you can do ANYTHING
__label__0 Alright , here we go. I guess we’ll start at the beginning so as to incorporate all of my stupidity.   I do a lot of hiking, I also have early arthritis. So one day I was hiking with the dogs and tripped over a rock. I went down hard. Hard on the same foot I’ve landed on a couple times. When I fell down the stairs, when I slipped in the winter, now hiking.   Now it hurt, it hurt a lot, and for a long time. But almost every single time I go to the doctor for these things it the same story. They take the X-ray, the doctor looks at it and then says “it’s just a flare up of your arthritis, take some Tylenol and Naproxen and keep pushing. Don’t let the muscle supporting the joint get weak … “and so on. So, I skipped going to the doctor and “kept pushing” I kept walking on it, from April to July. I kept hiking and lifting and working and doing it all. Until one day at work , when I was reaching for a display on my tip toes… POP!  Everything went muffled and quiet, I might as well have been a lone I was so zoned out when it happened. I don’t know if it was adrenaline or just not a major snap but it didn’t hurt. Until I tried to put weight on it. The second my foot touched the ground, ouch!. I remembered how my Mum always checked these things and tried to wiggle my toes. Nope… broken. I, surprisingly calmly, leaned against the counter, and paged my manager. He came out, I said “ I think my foot just broke, I need to go to the hospital” He got me a chair and my other manager helped me fill out paperwork for the workers comp claim.   Off to the hospital. X-rays, some phone calls, and a ride around the hospital in a very squeaky wheelchair. The doctors said it was indeed, broken. My fifth metatarsal to be exact. Apparently it’s a very common, but long to heal break and you absolutely must stay off it for at least 6 weeks.   A couple of appointment later and I’m off work for 6 weeks and in a plaster cast. ( we tried the air boot, not enough support). I’ve never had a cast.I got the fun tie dye one that the nurse recommended. Not that I was happy to break my foot, it threw a wrench in my life. But a break from work is nice. And I was determined to live my summer life.  Having a cast is DIFFICULT. It’s been way harder than I thought it would be. Our house is busy, and old, and has a lot of stairs and narrow hallways. Dogs and toddlers and chickens running around. And my mother, who has MS.   It’s been hard to get around, I’ve accidentally stepped on it and probably re-broken it a couple of times. I feel bad asking Mum to do anything. She’s had to take on all the responsibilities I had and it’s killing her! We’re financially stretched just like everyone. It’s been hell. And I’ve had to be up “on my feet” and doing more than I probably should be.   Where I really faltered was showering. I guess I didn’t make it air tight enough. Water got in, I didn’t even notice. It wasn’t soaked. But it all collected in the heal of the cast, and then stupidly I sealed it with duct take to try and keep my cast from getting scuffed… right on the heal.   This morning, I noticed it was damp in the toes. I had weird white goo on my foot and my heel felt like there was a stone in my cast that I’d been walking on for days. My Mum insisted I go to the hospital and have it checked. I called the fracture clinic and they said to come in right away. So I did.   They rushed me in and cut the cast off. Everyone spoke very calmly but more doctors kept coming in and crowding around to watch. They peeled it back and my heel was WHITE!. The smell was horrendous, that white goo was dying skin. The pain was my foot wrinkling and creasing and the skin almost breaking. I was so embarrassed. I started tearing up. The doctor doing the work with my cast told me it happens sometimes. That it’s important to keep your cast dry, and that he could tell I’ve been trying to walk on it. That it’s good I came in when I did because this is the beginning stage of trench foot and it could have gotten a lot worse very fast. He washed my foot and got me comfortable in a room while they let me dry out and discussed what to do. I sat there for an hour and a half before they decided it was safe to put it back in a plaster cast. It’s still broken after all.   It feels so much better. Hopefully in 3 more weeks I’ll be in an air boot and able to drive! And I learned a valuable lesson.     TL;DR : I neglected to care for my cast properly because I’m stubborn. It got wet, I got a mild case of trench foot. The doctors were very kind.
__label__0 As I'm sure you all know, there is a difference between tracing GC and reference-counting (RC) in that RC is deterministic (it releases memory at precisely the earliest moment possible) whereas GC isn't (it releases memory at some later moment, or even never). The deterministic aspect of RC is very useful when that memory happens to also hold valuable external resources like file handles or db connections. In languages with GC, though, this determinism is lost (it's replaced by finalizers which are not guaranteed to even run) and programmers have to resort to crude tricks like `try (resource) {...}` in Java, `using (resource) {...}` in C# or `defer` in Golang, which are simple runners of cleanup code at end of scope. Those solutions are manual (thus unsafe) and only work for single-owner, single-scope resources, so cannot handle sharing or dynamic lifetimes. My proposal is, why not augment the GC *memory* management with RC *resource* management?    1. The compiler determines if a type should be reference-counted by two conditions: a) it has a destructor (e.g. implements `IDisposable`) b) it cannot have references to RC types, even transitively (which is the usual case for resource handles - they don't hold references to other resource handles). Issue a warning if a) is true but b) isn't (such types cannot be RCed and have to be handled as before).    2. If a type should be RC'ed, the compiler inserts the usual code to increment and decrement its reference counts in necessary places.    3. Once such an object has its reference count drop to zero, its destructor/finalizer is invoked, which releases its resources but does not free its memory.    4. At some later date, the garbage collector may or may not free the object's memory.    I think this should hit the sweet spot between determinism and garbage collection. The key thing here is that the RC handles only the resource disposal, so the garbage collector can be completely oblivious to it. With no danger of reference cycles and full automatism, this can make GCed languages safer in regards to shared resource handling with the only change for the user being that the code becomes clearer. Not only instead of         using (File file = OpenFile(...) {          other code;      }    we'll be able to write         File file = OpenFile(...);      other code;    like in C++ but we'll also be able to pass around references to such resources, share them, and be sure that they are freed at the earliest possible moment. Also finalizers can then be safely removed from the garbage collector, which is a sore spot of current GCs.    What do you think about this?

__label__0 # Thanks everyone, I'm not keeping up with the responses to this anymore, I appreciate your input.    Hello everyone, I am struggling with some of the logic of veganism and the philosophy behind it. I ate plant-based for three years, had some really negative experiences and went back to an omnivorous diet, and am currently plant-based right now, but there's a lot of the philosophy that doesn't make sense to me anymore.    So one of my questions is: How is getting pregnant as a vegan an acceptable choice, assuming you have access to birth control? It's probably the most resource-intense choice you can make and many animals will surely die to produce resources for the new individual, even if they are vegan from birth.    If this is an acceptable choice to make then it seems like the condition of **as far as possible or practicable** is totally arbitrary, as nobody needs to get pregnant, and a vegan couple who have several children will probably be causing more suffering than a meat-eating couple who have no children, given that their kids are likely to have kids and grandchildren and so on and most likely some of them will not be vegan?    Counterpoints or arguments to this?    Thank you.    \[Edit: removed a comparison to the desire to eat meat and the desire to have children\]
__label__1 I’m in a bit of a meal planning rut and could really use some help! With two little ones at home, I find it challenging to come up with quick, healthy meals that everyone will actually eat. I want to avoid the dreaded dinner-time battles and keep things simple but nutritious.    Here’s what I’m working with:  - A 4-year-old who loves pasta and cheese but is a bit picky about veggies.  - A 2-year-old who will eat almost anything but has a tendency to throw food on the floor if he’s not in the mood.  - A busy schedule with work and activities, so I need meals that can be prepped in advance or cooked quickly.    I’m thinking of doing a mix of batch cooking and easy weeknight meals. Here are some ideas I’ve come up with:  1. **Pasta Primavera** - I can sneak in some veggies like bell peppers and zucchini, and toss it with olive oil and parmesan.  2. **Taco Night** - Ground turkey or beef with all the fixings. I can set up a taco bar and let the kids build their own.  3. **Sheet Pan Chicken and Veggies** - Just throw everything on a pan and roast it. Easy clean-up!  4. **Breakfast for Dinner** - Scrambled eggs, whole grain toast, and fruit. It’s quick and the kids love it.  5. **Homemade Pizza** - Use store-bought dough and let the kids add their own toppings. It’s fun and interactive!    I’d love to hear your go-to meals or any tips for making meal prep easier. How do you keep your little ones happy at the dinner table? Any favorite recipes or hacks would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I am in Medellin, Colombia right now. When I came to Colombia 3 months ago I have been to Cartagena first, then I stayed in Santa Marta and now I am in Medellin since a month. In another month I will head to the San Andres Island for a week, which will end by the end of November. By the middle of December I will be in Mexico with my gf to be with her family, but we dont know which place we could visit after San Andres and before being in Mexico again. We will have a timeframe of 2-3 weeks that we need to fill, but are not sure yet with what.    We have thought about going to Bogota but so far it really doesn't seem interesting at all to us. Its coldish and not that much appealing to us. Then there is the Salento area where you have the big palm trees, but that would be just a day tour.. not sure if thats worth staying in the whole place for 2 weeks. Another option we have been thinking of was going to Peru, to Lima or Cusco, but the flight from there back to Mexico are quite a lot more expensive than from Colombia.. so thats probably not worth it either. Another option would be Panama City which would be dope, but for some reason the flight from Panama to Guadalajara/Mexico is at least 400usd, which doesn't makes it worth either.    So I am hoping in getting some cool tipps and recommendations from you guys.

__label__1 I have to say, my favorite weapon in Horizon Forbidden West has to be the **Sharpshot Bow**. The versatility it offers is just incredible! I love how it allows for both precision shots and the ability to use elemental arrows. The way it feels to line up a shot and take down a machine from a distance is so satisfying.     Plus, the different types of arrows you can craft really add to the strategy of combat. Whether I'm using the piercing arrows to take down tougher foes or the elemental arrows to exploit weaknesses, it always feels like I have the right tool for the job.     What about you all? Do you prefer the Sharpshot Bow, or do you have another weapon that you find yourself gravitating towards?
__label__1 Draymond Green is the ultimate villain in the NBA, and as a Celtics fan, I can’t help but appreciate the entertainment he brings to the league. His antics on the court, whether it’s trash-talking, flopping, or getting into it with refs, make him a polarizing figure. You either love him or you absolutely can’t stand him.     For us Celtics fans, he’s the perfect target for our disdain. His cocky attitude and relentless defense can be infuriating, especially when he’s going up against our guys. But let’s be real, he’s also a key part of what makes the Warriors so successful, and that’s what makes him even more frustrating.     I find myself cheering for the Celtics to take him down every time we face off. It’s like a rite of passage for our team to overcome that Green obstacle.     What do you all think? Is there a player you love to hate as much as Draymond? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__0 Pretty sure this is a Nickeldeon show from the 2000s or 2010s. Here's what I remember:    MC (a girl, maybe in her 20s or a teenager) walks into a fancy-ish restaurant. The waiter at the front of the restaurant brings her to a booth seat and she sits there. I think how the restaurant works is that you can have a date with random people who enter the restaurant. (It's weird, I know). So MC sees a hot guy enter and she tries to get his attention so he sits with her. He doesn't, because bros before hoes apparently. Hot guy hugs some other guy who was probably waiting for him and MC is sad. Then a Discord mod looking guy enters and he sits opposite of MC at the booth. They order a salad.     Here's the weird part that made me remember this. So the salad in front of the Discord mod guy and he brings out his nail clipper. This guy starts to clip his nails and all the nail clippings fall into the salad. MC is shocked. Then when he's done, he starts to eat the salad and the nail clippings.     That's basically all I remember. I was a little kid when watching this so it's probably a show like Victorious of Sam &amp; Cat but I really have no idea.

__label__1 It's a harsh reality that no matter how much effort you put in or how perfectly you plan, success isn't guaranteed. Sometimes, external factors, luck, or timing play a bigger role than our own determination. It makes you wonder if the journey is more important than the destination, or if we should redefine what success really means.
__label__1 I've recently started playing Monster Hunter Portable 3rd and decided to give the Hunting Horn a try. I’ve always been intrigued by its support capabilities, but I’m struggling to understand how to effectively use it in hunts.     Could anyone provide some tips on the best way to utilize the Hunting Horn? Specifically, I’m looking for advice on:  1. **Song Combinations**: What are some essential songs I should focus on learning? Are there any specific combinations that work well together?  2. **Playstyle**: How should I position myself during hunts? Should I prioritize buffing teammates or dealing damage?   3. **Weapon Choices**: Are there any particular Hunting Horns that are considered top-tier in MHP3? What should I look for in terms of stats and songs?  4. **General Strategies**: Any general tips for new Hunting Horn players that could help me improve my gameplay?    I appreciate any insights you can share! Thanks!
__label__1 I've been experiencing a frustrating issue lately where I can't post anywhere on Reddit, even in subreddits where I've previously contributed. It seems like my account has been shadowbanned, but I can't figure out why. I've checked the rules of the subs I frequent, and I haven't violated any guidelines that I know of.     I tried reaching out to the mods of a couple of the subs, but I haven't received any responses. I also checked my account status, and it looks normal, but I can't seem to interact with the community at all.     Has anyone else experienced this? What steps did you take to resolve it? I'm really missing out on engaging with the content and discussions I love. Any advice would be appreciated!
__label__1 I just logged in to play some Contest of Champions and noticed that the special attack button has been moved! At first, I thought it was a glitch or something wrong with my game, but it seems like it’s a new update.     Has anyone else experienced this? I’m not sure how I feel about it yet. It’s definitely going to take some getting used to, especially in the heat of battle. I’ve accidentally activated my special attacks a couple of times when I didn’t mean to.     What do you all think? Is this a good change or do you prefer the old layout? Any tips on adjusting to the new button placement would be appreciated!
__label__0   I highly consider buying one, but after watching some reviews, I'm not sure that the Win600 is really worth investing in.    I think it's worth mentioning that I'm from Brazil and here it's hard to import brands like AYN and Ayaneo due to shipping and (mostly) very high fees.
__label__1 I wanted to share my first gaming experience in Mumbai, and I’d love to hear about yours too!     Growing up, I was always fascinated by video games but never had the chance to play them much. When I moved to Mumbai for college, I finally got the opportunity to dive into the gaming world. My first experience was at a local gaming cafe in Bandra. The atmosphere was electric, with people immersed in various games, from FIFA to Counter-Strike.     I remember being a bit nervous as I sat down at a computer, but the friendly staff helped me get set up. I decided to try my hand at Dota 2, a game I had heard so much about but never played. After a few initial losses, I started to get the hang of it, and the thrill of teamwork and strategy was exhilarating!     What made it even more special was the camaraderie among the players. Everyone was supportive, sharing tips and cheering each other on. I ended up spending hours there, and it felt like I had found a new community.     Since then, I’ve explored more games and even made some great friends through gaming. I’d love to hear about your first gaming experiences in Mumbai! Where did you play, what games did you start with, and how did it shape your love for gaming?

__label__1 I know this might be a hot take, but MCND really gives me early Monsta X vibes, and I think that's a good thing! Both groups have that high-energy, powerful sound that just makes you want to get up and dance. MCND's tracks like "Ice Age" and "Crush" have that same intensity and catchy hooks that Monsta X had in their debut era with songs like "Trespass" and "Hero."     Plus, both groups have a strong performance aspect, with impressive choreography that showcases their skills. I feel like MCND is kind of underrated right now, and if you liked Monsta X's early music, you might find a lot to love in MCND as well.     What do you all think? Do you see the similarities, or am I just imagining things?

I don't tend to gush but with everything else going on just some feel-good media did lift my spirits more than I thought it could.
__label__1 Gambling has always been a topic of interest for many, but its impact on mental health is often overlooked. I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences regarding how gambling can affect one's mental well-being, as I believe it's an important conversation to have.    For many, gambling starts as a fun and exciting activity, a way to unwind or socialize. However, it can quickly spiral into something much more serious. I’ve seen friends and family members get caught up in the thrill of winning, only to find themselves in a deep hole of debt and anxiety. The initial rush of winning can create a false sense of security, leading to more frequent and larger bets, which can ultimately result in devastating consequences.    From my perspective, the emotional toll of gambling can be immense. The highs of winning are often followed by crushing lows when losses occur. This cycle can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and hopelessness. I’ve noticed that many people who struggle with gambling often isolate themselves, fearing judgment from others or feeling like they can’t talk about their problems. This isolation can exacerbate feelings of depression and anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that’s hard to break.    Additionally, the stress of financial instability due to gambling can lead to relationship issues. I’ve seen how it can strain marriages and friendships, as trust erodes and communication breaks down. The burden of keeping secrets about gambling habits can weigh heavily on someone’s mental health, leading to further anxiety and depression.    If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling, it’s important to seek help. There are resources available, such as support groups and counseling, that can provide guidance and support. It’s crucial to remember that you’re not alone in this struggle, and there are people who understand what you’re going through.    I hope sharing my thoughts can help raise awareness about the impact of gambling on mental health. It’s a complex issue, but by talking about it, we can help break the stigma and encourage those who are suffering to seek the help they need.
__label__0 So I'm a pretty newbie in building a pc. I want my new build to be around 2k€.    What I was recommended by a friend around the 3080 3x OC 12gb GDDR6X was:    -Intel Core i7-12700F 4.9GHz  -Corsair RM750W 80 plus  -Seagate BarraCuda 3.5" 2TB SATA 3  -Corsair Hydro H100x  -Samsung 980 PRO 1TB SSD 4.0 NVMe M.2  -Corsair Carbise Spec-Delta RGB USB 3.0  -Asus TUF GAMING B660-Plus WIFI D4    i7 is good enough or should I go for an AMD for a similar price?    Should I get a better power suppply than the 750W?    Sould I get a bigger box for that build? I kinda think I should.    Is the motherboard good enough? I want a decent motherboard without skyrocketing to 400€.
__label__1 I'm currently working on a project that involves extracting music from a Nintendo DS game, and I'm running into some challenges. I've done some research and found a few tools that might help, like NSMBe and VGMTrans, but I'm not entirely sure how to use them effectively.    If anyone has experience with this or can provide a step-by-step guide on how to extract the music files, I would greatly appreciate it! Specifically, I'm looking to understand:    1. The best tools to use for extraction.  2. How to locate the music files within the .NDS file.  3. Any tips on converting the extracted files into a usable format (like .wav or .mp3).    Thanks in advance for your help! I'm excited to dive into this and any guidance would be super helpful.
__label__1 I find myself in a bit of a tricky situation and could really use some advice. I have some clothes that I want to sneak out of the house, but they’re currently in bin bags out back. The problem is that I can’t leave the house myself due to certain circumstances.     I’m wondering if anyone has any creative ideas on how I might be able to retrieve those clothes without drawing attention to myself or the situation.     Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any tips on how to discreetly get those bags out without being noticed? I’d appreciate any suggestions or experiences you can share!
__label__0 tl;dr: I travel a lot for work, and my wife does not think that calling her 5-6 times a day is enough. Additionally, I should not be doing anything fun/extra and all my extra time should be taken up with calling her.     My wife \[27f\] and I \[28m\] have been married for about 2 years and have a baby. I travel pretty often for work (every couple of weeks I am gone for about 3 weeks). While I am gone I am constantly texting her and calling her. I call her about 5 times a day and texting constantly. The other day me and my coworkers took an afternoon trip (a couple of hours) to do some sightseeing. My wife blew up saying that I would rather spend time with my coworkers than talk to her. She ended up telling me that while I am gone on these trips I am not allowed to do anything but work then go right back to my hotel where I should call her. Even breakfast and lunch which is normally eaten together with my coworkers, should be eaten alone in my car/room so that I can call her during this time. I was planning on doing something fun over the weekend (by myself mind you), but now all my plans are canceled and I am just sitting in my hotel room calling her. I am feeling so overburdened and controlled. I have tried to rationalize with her, but she just comes back at me saying that I need to stop arguing and just admit that I was in the wrong by not constantly being on the phone with her. I love her like crazy but fuck, I need my own space/time. She seems to have the attitude that if she cant do something fun, then I can't either. This happens constantly while I am gone and and I am getting pretty sick of it, but don't know how else to approach her about this. Any advice would be great.
__label__1 It's strange how we often treat physical health crises with urgency, yet mental health issues, which contribute to so many societal problems, are still stigmatized and overlooked. If we recognized mental health as a public health crisis, perhaps we could address the root causes of many issues like crime, poverty, and even relationship breakdowns. Instead, we often wait until the symptoms manifest in destructive ways, rather than investing in prevention and support. Why is it that we can see the importance of physical health but struggle to apply the same logic to mental well-being?

__label__1 I just had to share my experience with the platforming section from Subterranean Shunning Grounds to Deeproot Depths. I swear, I’ve faced bosses that took me hours to beat, but nothing has frustrated me quite like this descent.     First off, the sheer number of times I fell to my death was staggering. I lost count after the fifth time, and I’m pretty sure I could have beaten Malenia in that time instead. The camera angles are a nightmare, and the inconsistent hitboxes on the ledges made it feel like I was playing a game of chance rather than skill.     To put it into perspective, here are a few things that killed me fewer times than that platforming section:    1. **Malenia, Blade of Miquella** - I’ve fought her countless times, and while she’s a tough cookie, I managed to learn her patterns and eventually beat her.   2. **Radahn’s Meteorite Attack** - I mean, who hasn’t been flattened by that? But at least it was a one-time deal, not a repeated fall into the abyss.   3. **The Tree Sentinel** - I thought I was ready for him, but he took me down a few times before I figured out his moves. Still, it was a more enjoyable experience than the platforming hell.   4. **The Giant’s Fire Breath** - Sure, it’s deadly, but at least I could see it coming. The platforming felt like a cruel joke, where the game was just waiting for me to misstep.   5. **The Crucible Knight** - A tough fight, but again, I could strategize. The platforming? Just pure RNG.    I’m convinced that FromSoftware designed this section to test our patience more than our skills. I love the challenge of Elden Ring, but this was a whole new level of frustration. Anyone else feel my pain? What’s your most frustrating platforming moment in the game?
__label__0 Do the devs monitor this subreddit?  I sure hope so, because I think this idea has some potential.  I was really impressed by spatial audio with iOS 14 and AirPod Pros.  Since I don't have a full blown surround sound setup at my house, this is probably going to become my preferred way to watch movies now.    The biggest issue is that I can't use it with my TV and have to watch on my phone or iPad to use spatial audio.  I could hook my device up to the TV via HDMI but that would mean other viewers could not enjoy the movie or TV show with the same audio experience.  That's just not right.    I think it would be nice if Plex would allow the iOS app to serve as an "audio client".  Multiple users could open the app on their iPhone or iPad and connect to the server.  When the movie starts, the audio to each client would be synchronized with the video wherever it was playing (TV, Chromecast, iPad, Phone, etc).  Each user could use their own AirPod Pros to get the full spatial audio experience from wherever they may be sitting in the room.    I am a software developer and audio engineer myself, so I know there will be challenges to overcome to make this work, but I think this would be a killer feature.  Am I crazy?    EDIT: y’all think I am crazy. Yes, I said y’all.
__label__1 I'm currently working on a side quest for my players that involves a boss fight against a corrupted forest spirit. The spirit was once a guardian of the woods but has been twisted by dark magic, causing it to attack anyone who enters its domain.     I want to make this fight memorable and engaging, but I'm struggling with a few aspects:    1. **Abilities and Tactics**: What kind of abilities should the forest spirit have? I want it to feel powerful and connected to nature, but also corrupted. Maybe it could summon corrupted animals or manipulate the environment?     2. **Environment**: The fight will take place in a clearing surrounded by twisted trees and overgrown vines. How can I use the environment to enhance the fight? Should there be hazards or terrain features that the players can use to their advantage?    3. **Lore and Motivation**: I want the players to feel a sense of tragedy when they confront the spirit. How can I convey its backstory and the reason for its corruption during the fight? Should there be moments where it shows signs of its former self?    Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated! I'm looking for ways to make this encounter both challenging and emotionally impactful.

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I'm currently looking for a mid laner or an autofill player to join me for some flex queue games. I'm around Platinum 3 and would love to team up with players who are also in the Platinum+ range.     I enjoy playing a variety of champions, but I mainly focus on mages and assassins in the mid lane. I’m all about having fun while improving, so if you're down for some chill games or want to grind out some flex, hit me up!     Also, if you're just looking for some people to play normals with, I'm open to that too!     Feel free to add me on Discord: GamerDude#1234 or just drop your IGN here. Looking forward to playing together!

Any help or examples would be greatly appreciated!

If you're interested, please let me know your rates and any previous work you have done that I can check out. I'm excited to collaborate and bring this idea to life! Thank you!
__label__0 First post in reddit. English is not my mother tongue, sorry for any spelling errors.    Two weeks ago Fedora enter in suspension, when I came back to use the computer again it did not work. I force shutdown and started the computer, to my surprise I found out It did not start the OS and neither BIOS. Same like this youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeIHf8vp7JI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeIHf8vp7JI)    I left the computer to a technician and managed to set BIOS again. This technician told me to buy a new ssd for wwan slot, because the m.2 adapter or disk seemed to be broken.    I bought a new ssd for wwan slot (Western Digital SN520 of 256GB) and a m.2 to usb adapter. The new adapter can boot the old m.2 drive and the new ssd. But when I connect the drives internally the BIOS seems not to detect these drives.    The computer is a Thinkpad T480 with i7 8th gen and 16 GB of RAM. BIOS version is last available.    I searched and tried all the things I can, but I did not get a solution. So I ask here if someone knows what's happening, and how to fix it.    Thanks in advance :)    [Thinkpad T480 with Fedora running on a m.2 to USB adapter :\)](https://preview.redd.it/tkmqpyuwakw91.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d866e644b8265da7eac95e99ae526b8b9182a7fa)
__label__1 I've been using various Linux distributions for a while now, and I've come to a frustrating conclusion: all package managers suck in their own unique ways.     Take APT, for example. It's great for Debian-based systems, but the dependency hell can be a nightmare. You think you’re installing a simple package, and suddenly you’re dragged into a web of conflicting dependencies that require you to install or remove half your system.     Then there’s RPM. While it’s powerful, the lack of a unified approach across different distributions can lead to confusion. You might find a package that works perfectly on Fedora but fails miserably on CentOS.     And let’s not forget about Arch’s Pacman. Sure, it’s fast and efficient, but the Arch User Repository (AUR) can be a double-edged sword. You can find amazing packages, but you also have to deal with the risk of broken builds and unmaintained software.     Even newer package managers like Flatpak and Snap, which aim to solve some of these issues, come with their own set of problems. They can be slow, take up a lot of space, and sometimes lead to a fragmented experience where you have to juggle multiple formats.     I know that each package manager has its strengths and weaknesses, but it feels like we’re still far from a perfect solution. What are your thoughts? Do you have a favorite package manager, or do you share my frustrations? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I was finally starting to feel like I was getting my life together. After months of battling my depression, I had found a routine that worked for me. I was exercising regularly, eating healthier, and even started to reconnect with some friends. I felt a glimmer of hope, like maybe I could actually be happy again.     But then, out of nowhere, everything came crashing down. I lost my job unexpectedly, and it felt like the ground beneath me just disappeared. The anxiety kicked in, and I started spiraling. I couldn’t shake the feeling of worthlessness that came with losing my job. I felt like I had worked so hard to get to a better place, only to have it all ripped away from me in an instant.     Now, I’m back to feeling isolated and hopeless. I’ve been avoiding my friends because I don’t want to burden them with my problems. I can’t even bring myself to exercise or eat well anymore. I just feel so defeated. It’s like I was on the verge of climbing out of this dark hole, and now I’m back at the bottom, looking up and feeling like I’ll never get out.     I know I need to reach out for help, but it’s hard to find the motivation to do so. I just want to feel okay again, but right now, it feels impossible. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope when it feels like everything is falling apart just when you thought you were getting better?
__label__1 It's been a whirlwind of emotions lately, and I just wish I could share this part of my life with my mum. I've met someone truly special, and she makes my heart race in a way I never thought possible. We have so much in common, from our love for indie music to our obsession with late-night snacks.     I can picture the two of them together, laughing and sharing stories. My mum has always been my biggest supporter, and I know she would love her just as much as I do. I can imagine her asking all the right questions, wanting to know everything about this amazing woman who has captured my heart.     But I also worry about how my mum would react. I want her to be happy for me, to understand that love is love, no matter who it’s with. I just wish I could bridge that gap and introduce them, to see the joy in her eyes when she meets the person who makes me so incredibly happy.     Has anyone else felt this way? How did you navigate introducing your partner to your family? I could really use some advice!

__label__0 Sure the whole incest gag is getting overplayed, but it wasn't the base of many jokes and more of a McGuffin this episode.    For the rest, every set up is rewarded and every joke lands. You can feel the influence of the new writers but the presence of Dan Harmon is unmistakable in his talent for exploring tropes thoroughly and creatively.    The whole factory heist is pure gold with barely a moment of screen time wasted, especially Rick turning fortunes into monkeys paws. My one complaint would be that they spent a little too much time on the old dude.    Oh and Rick trying to Jack Sparrow himself into immortality only for Jerry to ruin it was the cherry on top. Just a 10/10 episode. Damn this season is going strong, guys!
__label__0 I (16m) work at a local amusement/water park, it’s a really fun job and I enjoy it most of the time. I work in the arcade at the park and it’s always nice to see kids come up and pick their prizes. We have a season pass and have many families who come here regularly, one of the groups that come here regularly is a group of 6 boys, who are 13.    These boys come almost every day, very chill guys, they like to talk to me when I’m behind the counter sometimes and tell me about their day, lives, ect, my coworkers also know them and love them, they’re really sweet and none of us have ever had an issue with them. About a week ago, one of the boys twin sister was invited for a birthday for one of her friends, the boy was there with his friends as always. We quickly found out his sister isn’t nearly as sweet as him.     One of the boys in the group wears a boys swimsuit that is from the 50s, he does swim for his school and loves the water area of our park. Sometimes his friends will be in the arcade while he’s still in that area, but he still comes to the arcade everyday. The boys came in to the arcade, played a few games and then started talking to me, they had mentioned how the boys sister was teasing his friend for his vintage swimsuit and one of the pool guys dealt with the issue, I didn’t think much of it at the time, until a few hours later. I was on break and stopped in the bathroom to get lunch, when I was washing my hands and about to leave, I saw a boy who looked around 12-13 come into the bathroom crying, I stopped and asked him if everything was ok, he told me that the bullies from his school were there and making fun of him again, I told him to talk to me about what was happening, he started telling me about the girls picking on him and I asked to see where they were, at this point, they had left the pool area and I looked around the park for them with him until we found them at one of the games. I explained to my coworker who was at the operating the booth, and we got our manager, the boy was at the park with two friends who told him they were going to get food.     I brought him to my bosses office, he explained everything that happened and I went to get my lunch, after I was done eating, I went back to the arcade, the group of boys came to me as soon as I got back and were telling me all about how this one boy’s sister got in trouble and how the mother was called, I quickly realized one of the girls I had just seen was his sister.    That night, after my shift, I was calling one of my coworkers and friend (21m) and he was telling me about how the mother of one of the girls came and went crazy, saying her daughter would never do such a thing and how her son came here all of the time and had no issues. She said that her daughter “makes jokes sometimes and only tells the truth”, she then went on about political correctness and Gen Z being soft and said a bunch of other rude stuff. My boss wasn’t having any of it and asked her to leave and not to bring her daughter back, the other 2 girls were banned as well.     The mother left bad reviews on Google and Yelp and had made a Facebook post in a local gossip group about what had happened, saying her daughter was a target and how this boy was making a story up. She said that her children would never bully anyone and how she’s a great mom and told parents not to bring their children there.     The boy who is the brother of the girl has come back though because he said his mother told him “you can go to that crappy place but don’t expect me to give you money again”, luckily the boys had him covered and with the approval of my manager, we gave him a massive discount so his friends wouldn’t have to pay too much.

__label__0 **Goal**: Trying to encourage Product Owner to write clear Tickets    I think just conveying to them how hard it is to write something clearly is a soft starting point.    **Considering**:    1. Have PO go read another PO's ticket (as old as possible)  2. Report back to me a short description of the Context of the ticket:     1. Why it's important     2. How might the programmer implement it     3. How understandable was it?  3. I'm guessing they'll have trouble with all 3.  4. Then have them do the same for one of THEIR tickets from a very long time ago.    **Any thoughts? Suggestions?**    &amp;#x200B;    &amp;#x200B;    **Background**    Observed a PO today. Great gal. Very enthusiastic.    Our VP of product was coaching her on writing better Jira tickets.    VP helped with:    1. clearer objective (Benefit)  2. Including a Story    I noticed also that the tickets were simply not terribly clear.  (I've written lots of unclear stuff. It's no crime).  **She said programmers often mis-implement.**    The **OKR** here is:   Improve clarity of Tickets and reduce frequency of mis-implementation.    &amp;#x200B;
__label__1 With Worlds 2023 just around the corner, I’ve been thinking about the various themes that Riot has used for the World Championship over the years. Each year brings a unique vibe and aesthetic that resonates with the community, but I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts on which theme stands out the most.    For me, the 2016 theme, "Worlds 2016: The Skirmish," was particularly memorable. The artwork was stunning, and the music was on point, capturing the intensity of the competition. Plus, the skins released that year were some of my favorites, especially the Championship Riven skin.     On the other hand, the 2018 theme, "The Light and the Dark," had a really cool narrative that tied into the lore of the game, and the visuals were breathtaking. The cinematic was epic and really set the stage for the tournament.    What do you all think? Which Worlds theme do you believe is the best and why? Let’s discuss our favorites and what made them special!

__label__1 When it comes to being a Dungeon Master (DM), experience can vary widely depending on the type of game you want to run and the players you have. Here are some thoughts on how much experience you might need:    1. **Basic Understanding of Rules**: At a minimum, you should have a good grasp of the core rules of the game system you are using (like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, etc.). This includes understanding how combat works, how spells function, and the general flow of gameplay. You don’t need to know every rule by heart, but being familiar with the basics will help you run the game smoothly.    2. **Storytelling Skills**: Experience in storytelling can greatly enhance your ability as a DM. You don’t need to be a published author, but being able to weave a narrative, create engaging characters, and build immersive worlds is crucial. This can come from experience in writing, acting, or even just a love for storytelling.    3. **Improvisation**: No matter how much you prepare, players will always find a way to surprise you. Being comfortable with improvisation and thinking on your feet is a valuable skill. This can be developed through practice, whether in gaming or other areas of life.    4. **Player Management**: Experience in managing different personalities and play styles is important. Understanding how to keep everyone engaged, resolve conflicts, and encourage quieter players to participate can make or break a session. This often comes with time and experience in group dynamics.    5. **Feedback and Adaptation**: Being open to feedback from your players and willing to adapt your style or the campaign based on their preferences is key. This is something that improves with experience as you learn what works and what doesn’t.    6. **Practice**: Ultimately, the best way to gain experience is to just start running games. You can begin with one-shots or shorter campaigns to build your confidence. Many DMs find that they learn the most through actual play, so don’t be afraid to dive in!    In summary, while having experience can help, it’s not a strict requirement. Many new DMs start with little to no experience and learn as they go. The most important thing is to be enthusiastic, prepared to learn, and ready to have fun with your players!
__label__1 I’m currently working on an expenses sheet in Excel, and I’m running into some issues that I hope you all can help me with.     I have a table where I track various expenses, including the date, category, amount, and notes. I want to create a summary section that automatically calculates the total expenses for each category and displays them in a separate area of the sheet.     Here’s what I have so far:    1. **Data Table**:      - Column A: Date     - Column B: Category     - Column C: Amount     - Column D: Notes    2. **Summary Section**: I want to list each category in one column and have the total expenses for that category in the next column.     I’ve tried using the `SUMIF` function, but I’m not sure if I’m using it correctly. Here’s the formula I attempted:    `=SUMIF(B:B, "CategoryName", C:C)`    (Where "CategoryName" is the name of the category I want to sum up.)    However, I’m not getting the expected results.     Could someone please help me with the correct formula or suggest a better way to set this up? Also, if there’s a way to automatically update the summary section when I add new expenses, that would be great!     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I’ve been struggling with my relationship with my twin brother and my family for years. Growing up, I always felt overshadowed by my brother. He was the golden child, the one who could do no wrong in my parents' eyes. I was constantly compared to him, and it felt like I could never measure up.     As we got older, things didn’t improve. My brother became more arrogant, and my family continued to enable his behavior. I tried to voice my feelings, but it always ended in arguments or them dismissing my concerns. I felt trapped in a cycle of resentment and hurt, and it was affecting my mental health.     After a particularly nasty fight where my brother belittled me in front of our parents, I finally decided enough was enough. I cut ties with him and distanced myself from my family. I thought that by doing this, I would feel a sense of relief, a weight lifted off my shoulders.     But here I am, weeks later, and nothing has changed. I don’t feel free; I feel empty. I thought that removing toxic people from my life would bring me peace, but instead, I just feel more isolated. I miss the good memories we had, even if they were few and far between. I miss the idea of family, even if it was never what I wanted it to be.     I thought I would feel empowered by my decision, but instead, I feel lost. I’m struggling to find my identity outside of my family dynamics, and it’s harder than I anticipated. I thought cutting them out would be the solution, but now I’m left with the reality that I have to rebuild my life from scratch.     I guess I just wanted to share this because I feel like I’m in a limbo. I don’t regret my decision, but I also didn’t expect it to feel this way. I’m trying to find a way to move forward, but it’s tough. If anyone has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your thoughts.
__label__1 I've been struggling with intense fatigue and brain fog lately, and I'm looking for some nootropic suggestions that could help boost my energy levels and mental clarity.     I've tried a few things in the past, like caffeine and L-theanine, but I still feel like I need something more effective. I've heard about Rhodiola Rosea and its potential benefits for fatigue and cognitive function. Has anyone had success with it?     Additionally, I'm curious about other options like Bacopa Monnieri or even something like Lion's Mane. Do these help with brain fog, or are there better alternatives?     Any personal experiences or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 I've been trying to decide between playing on Proudmoore or Stormrage for my first real dive into WoW, and I could use some advice from the community.     From what I've gathered, Proudmoore seems to have a more laid-back, casual vibe, which is appealing since I'm new and still learning the ropes. I’ve heard it’s a great place for socializing and finding groups for dungeons and raids without too much pressure. On the other hand, Stormrage seems to be more competitive and has a larger player base, which could mean more opportunities for endgame content but also a steeper learning curve.    For those of you who have experience on either realm, what are your thoughts? Is one better for a newbie like me? Are there any specific communities or guilds on either realm that are welcoming to new players? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I have a crazy theory that just came to mind as I was thinking about creation. Here me out it might sound bizarre but not too far fetched. So my theory starts now: When God was creating the earth he was trying to make creatures to live on the earth. This is when dinosaurs were made. They were gods first ever creatures. First ever projects. As he made more he thought that these creatures weren’t fit for the earth or simply didn’t like them, millions of reasons that I can’t think of. So God sent down a asteroid down to earth, to wipe them all out. He then proceeded to restart. This is when he created Adam and Eve. This is when the Bible started. The human race started.    Post Note: None of this has any proof or evidence surrounding this theory. It’s simply just a theory I made up because it would kinda make since. It is though very very interesting tot hunk about. I am in no way not Christian. I believe in God and everything. just a fun theory I came up with.

__label__1 I just wanted to share a little reminder for everyone playing Magic Arena. It’s super important to be mindful of how we cast our spells, especially in a competitive environment. I’ve noticed some players taking their sweet time during their turns, casting spells that don’t really impact the game state or just trying to get a reaction out of their opponents.     Let’s keep the game flowing smoothly! If you have a spell that can wait until the end of your opponent's turn, or if it’s not a game-changing play, consider holding off until your own turn. It helps maintain the pace of the game and keeps everyone engaged.     We’re all here to have fun and enjoy the game, so let’s be considerate of each other’s time. Happy gaming, everyone! 👍🏽

__label__1 This weekend, there will be a Pro-Choice North Carolina protest happening in downtown Asheville, and I wanted to share the details for anyone interested in joining or supporting the cause. The event is set for Saturday at 1 PM, starting at Pack Square Park.     With the recent changes in reproductive rights across the country, it's more important than ever to stand up for our rights and advocate for access to safe and legal abortion. The protest aims to raise awareness about the ongoing fight for reproductive justice and to show solidarity with those affected by restrictive laws.    There will be speakers, music, and opportunities to connect with local organizations that support reproductive rights. Bring your signs, your voices, and your passion! Let's make our presence known and show that Asheville stands for choice and equality.    If you have any questions or want to coordinate with others, feel free to comment below. Hope to see many of you there!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just wanted to share a little experience I had recently. After taking a break from osu! for a few months, I decided to jump back in and play a few games. To my surprise, my player rank actually went up a couple hundred spots!     I was expecting to struggle a bit since I hadn’t played in so long, but it seems like my muscle memory kicked in and I was able to hit some decent scores on maps I used to play. I even managed to FC a couple of my favorite songs that I had previously struggled with.     It got me thinking about how taking breaks can sometimes be beneficial. I feel like I came back with a fresh perspective and a bit more patience, which helped me focus better on my gameplay.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? Did taking a break help you improve or change your approach to the game? Would love to hear your stories!

__label__1 In the wake of Liz Truss's tumultuous premiership, British newspapers are buzzing with speculation about her grip on power, dubbing her the "ghost PM" as her leadership faces increasing scrutiny. Truss, who took office just weeks ago, has been criticized for her handling of the economy and her controversial tax policies, which have sparked widespread protests and market instability.    The Financial Times highlights the growing discontent within her own party, with several Conservative MPs reportedly calling for a leadership challenge. Meanwhile, The Guardian notes that Truss's approval ratings have plummeted, with many voters expressing a lack of confidence in her ability to lead the country through its current challenges.    In contrast, The Daily Telegraph suggests that Truss remains resolute, emphasizing her commitment to her economic agenda despite the backlash. However, political analysts warn that her position is precarious, and without a significant turnaround in public opinion, her tenure could be short-lived.    As the situation unfolds, the question remains: can Liz Truss regain the trust of her party and the public, or will she become a footnote in the history of British politics? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the future of her leadership.
__label__0 Hello.    Is there a suitable sample or paper for optimizing the schedule of the production line of a semiconductor factory with about 20 parameters through reinforcement learning? It feels like we're giving a reward if we keep the delivery date.    For example, switching the production line may stop production for about 1 day, or if the necessary goods are not delivered, the progress of any production line may stop.    By the way, can Google OR-Tools solve this problem?    I understand that there are many solutions, and I wonder the most appropriate solution.

__label__1 I've been experimenting with the "Combat Camera Recovery" option in the settings, and I have to say, it’s a game changer for me! For those who might not be familiar, this setting allows the camera to automatically adjust and recover its position after being knocked around during combat.     Initially, I was skeptical about it. I thought it might take away from the immersion or the intensity of the battles, but I’ve found that it actually enhances my gameplay experience. When I’m in the heat of battle, especially against multiple enemies, the camera can get a bit chaotic. With this option enabled, I feel like I have better control over my character and can focus on dodging and attacking without constantly having to readjust the camera myself.     However, I can see how some players might prefer the traditional camera control for a more manual experience. It could be a matter of personal preference, but for those who struggle with camera angles during intense fights, I highly recommend giving it a try.     What do you all think? Have you tried the Combat Camera Recovery option? Does it help your gameplay, or do you prefer the classic camera control?

__label__1 Is anyone else just completely blown away by the fact that we are getting a live-action version of Daredevil in the upcoming Disney+ series? I mean, after the Netflix series, I thought we might never see Charlie Cox don the mask again. The way they handled his character was so perfect, and now he's back in the MCU!     I can't help but wonder how they will integrate him into the larger Marvel universe. Will we see him interact with other heroes like Spider-Man or the new Avengers? And what about the tone? The Netflix series had a darker, grittier vibe, which I loved, but will Disney keep that same energy, or will they tone it down for a broader audience?     Also, what are your thoughts on the potential for crossovers with other characters? I think it would be amazing to see him team up with someone like Jessica Jones or even the Punisher again.     Let’s discuss! What are your hopes and predictions for the new Daredevil series?
__label__0 We are looking to return to Ireland during the last two weeks in May next year, and the hotel we stayed at last time says they have no availability. I was surprised to see them completely booked 10 months in advance. I was wondering if there was anything big going on in Dublin the week/end of May 18-22. Any big festivals, events, or other crowd draws beyond the normal hustle and bustle.    Anyone aware of anything? Thanks in advance.

__label__1 I’m currently renting an apartment in Southern Oregon and I have some questions about tenant/landlord laws in this area. I’ve been having issues with my landlord regarding maintenance requests and the return of my security deposit.     1. **Maintenance Issues**: I’ve submitted multiple requests for repairs that have not been addressed in a timely manner. I understand that landlords are required to maintain habitable living conditions, but I’m not sure what the specific laws are regarding how quickly they must respond to maintenance requests. Is there a legal timeframe they must adhere to?     2. **Security Deposit**: I moved out last month and my landlord has not returned my security deposit yet. I’ve read that in Oregon, landlords have 31 days to return the deposit or provide an itemized list of deductions. It’s been over 40 days now, and I haven’t heard anything. What steps can I take to ensure I get my deposit back? Can I file a complaint or take legal action if they don’t respond?     3. **General Rights**: Are there any other tenant rights I should be aware of in Southern Oregon? I want to make sure I’m fully informed about my rights as a tenant, especially in case I need to escalate any issues with my landlord.     Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I feel like I’m stuck in a never-ending cycle of sadness and hopelessness. Every day feels like a battle just to get out of bed and face the world. I used to have dreams and aspirations, but now they feel so far out of reach. I wake up, go through the motions of the day, and then go back to sleep, only to do it all over again.     I try to put on a brave face for my friends and family, but inside I’m crumbling. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me, and I hate that I can’t just snap out of it. I see people living their lives, laughing, and enjoying simple things, and I can’t help but feel envious.     I’ve tried therapy and medication, but nothing seems to work. I often wonder if I’ll ever feel normal again or if this is just how my life is going to be from now on. I don’t want to keep feeling this way, but I don’t know how to change it.     I guess I’m just looking for some understanding or support. It’s hard to talk about this with people who don’t understand what it’s like to feel so lost and alone. If anyone else is feeling this way, I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences.

__label__1 I’m feeling really confused and hurt right now. My ex and I broke up about two months ago, and since then, it’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. At first, I thought we could stay friends, but I quickly realized that I needed to go no contact to heal. I told her this, and she seemed to understand, but then things took a strange turn.    She started blocking and unblocking me on social media. One minute, I’d see her posts and stories, and the next, I’d be blocked. It’s like she’s playing this game where she wants to keep me in her life but also wants to push me away. I don’t understand why she can’t just stick to one decision.     When she unblocks me, I feel this glimmer of hope that maybe she misses me, but then she blocks me again, and it feels like a punch to the gut. It’s so frustrating because I’m trying to move on, but her actions keep pulling me back into this emotional turmoil.     I’ve been focusing on myself and trying to heal, but this back-and-forth is making it so much harder. I just want to be free from this cycle. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with the confusion and hurt? I really need some advice on how to handle this situation.
__label__1 I've been trying to force my PS3 to output a different resolution while using an AV cable, but I'm running into some issues. I know that the PS3 typically defaults to 480i when using composite AV cables, and I want to see if I can get it to output at 720p or 1080p instead.    I've tried changing the resolution settings in the XMB, but it seems like the system just won't allow it when it detects the AV cable. Is there a way to force a higher resolution output through some kind of trick or workaround?     I've heard about holding down the power button to reset the video output, but I'm not sure if that will help in this case. Any advice or tips from those who have successfully managed to change the resolution while using AV cables would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__1 Karma farming on Reddit can be described using a few different terms. Some might refer to these users as "Karma Farmers" or "Karma Whores," which directly highlights their intent to accumulate karma points through various means, often by posting low-effort content or engaging in upvote-baiting tactics.     Others might use terms like "Content Chasers" or "Karma Seekers" to describe those who prioritize gaining karma over genuine engagement or meaningful contributions to discussions.     Additionally, some might call them "Trend Riders" if they tend to jump on popular topics or memes solely for the sake of gaining visibility and upvotes.     Ultimately, the language used can vary based on the community's tone and the specific behaviors exhibited by these users. What terms do you think best capture the essence of karma farming?

__label__0 I've heard the quote "It takes a village to raise a child".    I'm a first time mom of a 10 month old. The "village" is just me. I'd like it to be at least my husband and I, but because I'm the stay at home parent I'm also the default  parent. Yes he helps by watching her while I shower or pump or work on school assignments. But it's still me who's running the house hold and answering all his questions about where things are and what he can do to help me, or how to take care of her.    After 10 months of doing it all my parents finally reached out to me and offered to baby sit her while my husband and I went out to purchase a new car. It's fun and easy to baby sit a baby, but since it took this long and was more of a needed baby sitting scenario than a "go out on a date and have fun!" Kind of thing, I worry the baby sitting done by my "village" is going to be few and very far between.     It's still fairly easy taking care of her, but I know it's going to get harder very soon once the toddler stage kicks in.     I've been doing better at my mental health by staying medicated and when I'm done pumping I plan to get on mild edibles to keep my anxiety and overstimulation down, but I still worry I'm going to lose my cool.     Childcare is an option and we'll see if I need it but it is so expensive and nerve-wracking to have someone else watch your kid.     My village consists of Miss Rachel, Bluey, Hey Bear, and Blues Clues. So I can have a moment to down a coke and eat some pretzels before I'm needed again.     Thanks for listening.

__label__1 As we head into the 2022 NFL season, the AFC West is shaping up to be one of the most competitive divisions in football. With the addition of star players and some key offseason moves, here's how I see the division playing out:    1. **Kansas City Chiefs**    The Chiefs remain the team to beat in the AFC West. With Patrick Mahomes at the helm, they have one of the most explosive offenses in the league. Despite losing Tyreek Hill, they’ve added JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, which should help maintain their offensive firepower. Their defense has also improved with the addition of some key free agents. I predict they finish the season with a record of 12-5.    2. **Los Angeles Chargers**    The Chargers are a team on the rise. Justin Herbert is quickly becoming one of the top quarterbacks in the league, and with weapons like Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, they can score with anyone. The defense has also been bolstered by the addition of Khalil Mack and J.C. Jackson. I see them finishing just behind the Chiefs at 11-6, making a strong push for a playoff spot.    3. **Denver Broncos**    With the acquisition of Russell Wilson, the Broncos are looking to turn their fortunes around. Wilson brings a wealth of experience and talent to the quarterback position, which has been a struggle for Denver in recent years. However, the team still has some questions on the offensive line and defense. I predict they’ll finish the season at 9-8, just missing the playoffs.    4. **Las Vegas Raiders**    The Raiders have made some interesting moves this offseason, including hiring Josh McDaniels as head coach and acquiring Davante Adams. While they have the potential to be competitive, I think they still have some holes to fill, particularly on defense. I see them finishing at 7-10, but they could surprise some teams if everything clicks.    Overall, the AFC West is going to be a thrilling division to watch this season. Each team has the potential to make a playoff run, and I can’t wait to see how it all unfolds!
__label__1 As a recent graduate in the UK, I’m seeking advice on how to navigate the job market effectively. I have a degree in chemistry and am particularly interested in roles within the pharmaceutical or environmental sectors.     I’ve been applying for various positions, but I’m not getting many responses. I’ve tailored my CV and cover letters for each application, but I feel like I might be missing something crucial.     Here are a few specific questions I have:  1. What are the best platforms or websites to find graduate jobs in chemistry?  2. How important is networking in this field, and what are some effective ways to network?  3. Are there any specific skills or experiences that employers in the chemistry sector are looking for that I should focus on developing?  4.

__label__1 I just read the latest article on WarCom about the 11th Legion, and I have to say, I’m really excited about what they’re bringing to the table! The lore surrounding the 11th Legion has always been a bit murky, but this article sheds some light on their history and unique characteristics.    From what I gathered, the 11th Legion, known as the "Silent Ones," has a reputation for their stealth and cunning tactics. They seem to have a strong emphasis on ambush strategies and guerrilla warfare, which is a refreshing change from the more straightforward approaches of other legions. The article also hinted at some new units and characters that will be introduced, which could really shake up the meta.    I’m particularly intrigued by the mention of their Primarch, who is said to have a mysterious past and a unique psychic ability that enhances their stealth capabilities. It sounds like they might have some interesting synergies with other units in the game.    What do you all think? Are you excited about the 11th Legion? Do you think they’ll be competitive in the current landscape of Warhammer 40k? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any theories you might have about their upcoming releases!
__label__1 I've been on the hunt for sustainable shoes and clothing that not only look good but also feel great to wear. Recently, I came across a brand that claims to have the most comfortable shoes in the world, and I wanted to share my thoughts and get your opinions.    The brand focuses on using eco-friendly materials and ethical manufacturing processes, which is a huge plus for me. They offer a range of styles, from casual sneakers to more formal options, all designed with comfort in mind. I tried on a pair of their sneakers, and I have to say, they felt like walking on clouds! The cushioning and support were impressive, and I could see myself wearing them all day without discomfort.    In addition to shoes, they also have a line of clothing made from sustainable fabrics. I picked up a couple of their t-shirts and joggers, and the quality is top-notch. They fit well and have a nice, relaxed vibe that works for both lounging and casual outings.    I’m curious if anyone else has tried this brand or similar sustainable options. What are your go-to sustainable shoes and clothing? Any recommendations for brands that prioritize comfort and eco-friendliness? Let’s share our favorites!
__label__1 I recently completed a Python for Beginners course on Udemy, and I wanted to share my experience with the community. The course, titled "Python For Beginners Demonstration Course - UdemyDegree," is designed for those who have little to no programming experience and want to get started with Python.    The course covers the basics of Python programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and modules. Each section is well-structured, with clear explanations and practical examples that help reinforce the concepts. The instructor also provides coding exercises at the end of each module, which I found very helpful for practicing what I learned.    One of the highlights of the course is the hands-on projects that allow you to apply your skills in real-world scenarios. For instance, we built a simple calculator and a basic text-based game, which made the learning process engaging and fun.    I appreciated the community aspect of the course as well. There is a discussion forum where students can ask questions and share their progress, which fosters a supportive learning environment.    Overall, I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to start their journey in Python programming. It’s a great way to build a solid foundation and gain confidence in coding. If you're interested, you can find it on Udemy. Happy coding!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I'm currently in the market for a new gaming laptop and I'm torn between the MSI GT63 and the GT66. I’ve done some research, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with either of these models.    The GT63 has some solid specs with the Intel i7-8750H and GTX 1070, which seems to handle most games quite well. However, I’ve heard that the GT66 comes with the newer RTX 3060, which would be a significant upgrade in terms of graphics performance and ray tracing capabilities.     I’m particularly interested in how they perform thermally and acoustically during gaming sessions. I’ve read that the GT63 can get a bit loud under load, but I’m curious if the GT66 has improved in that regard. Also, how’s the battery life on both models? I know gaming laptops aren’t known for great battery life, but any insights would be appreciated.    Lastly, if anyone has any recommendations on which one to go for based on gaming performance, build quality, or any other factors, I’d love to hear your thoughts!    Thanks in advance!

__label__1 So I just started watching One Piece, and I’m currently on episode 30. I’ve heard so much about this series and its incredible world-building, but I’m still trying to wrap my head around all the characters and their motivations.     I’m really enjoying the dynamic between Luffy and his crew, especially Zoro and Nami. Their interactions are hilarious and heartwarming at the same time. I also love how each character has their own unique backstory that adds depth to the overall narrative.     I’m curious, for those who have watched the series, what are some of your favorite arcs or moments so far? I’ve heard that the East Blue saga is just the beginning, and I can’t wait to see how the story unfolds. Also, any tips for a newbie on what to look out for as I continue my journey?

Any tips on how to maintain it for longevity would also be appreciated!
__label__1 I've been diving into the world of SAG-AFTRA and the broader entertainment industry, and I'm curious if there are any startups out there looking to disrupt the traditional models that these unions represent.     For those who may not be familiar, SAG-AFTRA is a union that represents thousands of actors, broadcasters, and other media professionals, and it plays a significant role in negotiating contracts, protecting rights, and ensuring fair pay. However, with the rise of digital content, streaming platforms, and independent creators, I can't help but wonder if there's an opportunity for innovation in this space.    Are there any startups that are trying to create alternative models for representation, contract negotiation, or even payment systems for creatives? For example, could blockchain technology be used to ensure fair compensation for artists? Or are there platforms emerging that allow creators to connect directly with producers without the need for traditional union involvement?    I’d love to hear your thoughts or any examples of companies that are attempting to challenge the status quo in this industry. What do you think the future holds for unions like SAG-AFTRA in the face of these potential disruptions?
__label__1 So, I (28F) recently went out to dinner with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. We went to a nice restaurant, and everyone was excited to order. I had a pretty busy day and wasn't feeling super hungry, so I decided to just order a small appetizer and a drink.     As the night went on, my friends ordered a bunch of different dishes to share, and I tried a few bites of their food. I was enjoying the atmosphere and the company, but I really didn't eat much. When the bill came, it was split evenly among all of us, which is the norm in our friend group.     I looked at the bill and realized that I was being charged for a significant amount of food that I didn't eat. I brought this up to my friends, explaining that I only had a small appetizer and a drink, and I felt it was unfair for me to pay the same amount as those who had ordered multiple entrees and shared plates.     Some of my friends agreed with me, but others insisted that splitting the bill evenly was just how we always did it, and that it was part of the experience of dining out together. I felt uncomfortable and ended up paying my share, but I was really upset about it.     After the dinner, I talked to one of my friends who was on my side, and they suggested that I should have stood my ground and refused to pay for food I didn't eat. Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong for even bringing it up. AITA for refusing to pay for food I didn't eat?
__label__0 Its late and I can't sleep. So I guess im juat gonna vent a little. It's been a rought few months. We made the move to a new state but shit went sideways on the move. Now all of our stuff is almost 1.5 states a way and we ended up here broke and everything we had fell through. So we have been bouncing between living in our truck and what ever motel we can afford. The place we are at now we have stayed at a few times before. But this time we got a room with bed bugs. My husband works over night an our kid has their own bed, so thankfully its only me thats been being eaten. But it turns out im allergic to bed bugs and they leave huge welts on me...    After finding and confirming it to be bed bugs we told the owner of the motel who was huffy but heat treated the room themselves. I think the one treatment failed an d im still getting bite/welts just not as many.     Our turck broke down thanks to a bad transmission line and we can only have it here so long as we are staying here.. Honestly Im so scared and unsure of what to do right now. In a few days our stay is up but it lines up with his pay check. We will have just enough for 2 more weeks.     This is where the potential problem comes in. 1) The reviews about this place that talk about bed bugs make me worry that the owner will just refuse to rent to us again due to us reporting we found the bugs. 2)This is the only place we can afford. 3) The truck will be towed if we aren't staying here because it can't move on it's own.     We are talking about what to do but im a bit stuck.    On one hand if she doesn't bar us from renting as she has done to others in the past. The treatment failed and there is a good chance I will just be eaten by bugs in the next room. But we won't loose the only things we have left cuz the truck can stay here.     On the other we get barred and/ or just try to find another place an hope we can move the truck some how and we don't get eaten by bed bugs. {hopefully} Then continue to struggle and try to get out of the chasm that is homelessness.    Ive managed to keep it together but since the bes bugs things started I can't sleep or eat and the bites are driving me crazy cuz they burn/itch an hurt to touch. My husband has said he hate seeing me like this an wants to try an find a new place/ way to move the truck.    But again im the only one they seem to want to eat on. So I feel really bad and that whether we do or don't dont get barred for renting we won't find a place and then it will be my fault we end up on the street because I just couldn't/ wouldn't just dealing with the bed bugs eating me. Ive got a 2yo... And im at a loss emotionally.    Whats the right an/ or best thing to do here? I don't think I can handle loosing what little we have left. Should I convince him to stay if we can and just say fuck it hoping the next room is clean/ just shut up an be eaten if its not so we don't have to take the risk..?     TLDR: been homeless a few months dealing with bed bugs and how we might loose everything thanks to them. While feeling guilty as hell over it all.
__label__1 I've been diving into the mechanics of Bloodborne, and I'm trying to wrap my head around how the bolt damage works, especially in relation to certain enemies and bosses. I know that bolt damage is particularly effective against certain foes, like the Church and the Beast-type enemies, but I'm not entirely clear on how to maximize its effectiveness.    Can anyone explain how bolt damage interacts with enemy resistances? Also, what are some good weapons or items that scale with bolt damage? I've been using the Tonitrus and I love the way it feels, but I want to make sure I'm using it to its full potential. Any tips on strategies or specific enemies where bolt damage shines would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’ve been reflecting on the concept of putting the Lord to the test, especially in light of Matthew 4:7 where Jesus responds to the devil by saying, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." It raises an interesting question for me: is it ever appropriate to challenge God or ask for signs in our faith journey?    I know that many of us have moments of doubt or uncertainty, and sometimes we seek reassurance from God. I’ve found myself praying for specific signs or answers, hoping to feel His presence more tangibly in my life. But I also wonder if this is a form of testing Him, and if so, what the implications of that might be.    How do you all navigate this tension? Is there a difference between seeking confirmation of faith and putting God to the test? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Have you ever felt like you were testing God, and how did that impact your relationship with Him?
__label__1 Escaping from Tarkov can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially with all the mechanics and maps to learn. Here’s a quick guide to help you get back on track:    1. **Choose Your PMC or Scav**: Decide whether you want to play as your PMC (Private Military Company) or a Scav (Scavenger). Playing as a Scav can be a good way to learn the maps without risking your gear.    2. **Select a Map**: Familiarize yourself with the different maps available in Tarkov. Each map has its own extraction points, loot locations, and enemy spawns. Popular maps for beginners include Customs and Interchange.    3. **Know Your Extracts**: Each map has specific extraction points that you need to reach to successfully escape. Make sure to check the extraction points for the map you’re playing on. You can find this information on the Escape from Tarkov wiki or various community guides.    4. **Gear Up**: Before heading into a raid, make sure you have the right gear. This includes weapons, armor, and medical supplies. Don’t go in with your best gear until you’re more comfortable with the game.    5. **Play Smart**: Use stealth and cover to your advantage. Avoid unnecessary fights, especially if you’re not confident in your combat skills. Listen for audio cues and be aware of your surroundings.    6. **Learn the Loot**: Understanding what loot is valuable can help you make better decisions during raids. Prioritize items that are in high demand for trades or quests.    7. **Complete Quests**: Completing quests can help you level up and unlock better gear. Focus on the early quests given by traders to get a feel for the game.    8. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Don’t get discouraged if you die a lot at first. Each raid is a learning experience. The more you play, the better you’ll get at navigating the maps and engaging in combat.    9. **Watch and Learn**: Consider watching streamers or YouTube videos of experienced players. They often share tips and strategies that can help you improve your gameplay.    10. **Have Fun**: Remember, Tarkov is a game, and it’s meant to be enjoyed. Take your time, learn at your own pace, and don’t be afraid to ask for help from the community.    Good luck out there, and may your raids be successful!
__label__1 The 2022 adaptation of Bleach, titled "Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War," is not a remake but rather a continuation of the original series. It adapts the final arc of Tite Kubo's manga, which was not covered in the original anime that ended in 2012. This new series picks up where the original left off and brings the story to its conclusion, focusing on the epic battles between the Soul Reapers and the Quincy. Fans of the original series can expect a more polished animation style and a faithful representation of the manga's storyline. So, if you're wondering whether to dive into it, rest assured that it's a direct sequel that wraps up the beloved story!

__label__1 I'm considering taking an algorithms course at Foothill College and wanted to get some insights from anyone who has taken it. There are a couple of options available, and I'm particularly interested in which one might be the best fit for someone in the OMSCS program.     I've heard that the course taught by Professor X is quite rigorous and covers a lot of ground, including data structures, sorting algorithms, and complexity analysis. However, I've also seen that Professor Y has a more hands-on approach with projects that might be beneficial for practical understanding.     If anyone has experience with either of these courses, could you share your thoughts on the workload, teaching style, and how well it prepares you for advanced topics in computer science? Any advice on which course to choose would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been rewatching some of the older SMG4 videos, and I can't help but wonder how Lower Kong first learned about SMG4. Was it through the Mario games, or did he stumble upon one of the earlier SMG4 videos?     It’s interesting to think about how characters from different universes interact and how they might perceive the chaotic world of SMG4. Lower Kong seems like he would have a unique take on the shenanigans that happen in the SMG4 universe.     What do you all think? Did he just hear about the antics from other characters, or did he have a direct encounter with the gang? Would love to hear your theories!

__label__1 I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way, but the constant presence of phones in the classroom is driving me up the wall! I’ve tried everything from setting clear rules about phone usage to implementing a phone basket at the front of the room, but it seems like students are more attached to their devices than ever.    I understand that technology can be a great tool for learning, but it often feels like it’s more of a distraction than anything else. I’ve noticed that students are more focused on their social media notifications than on the lesson at hand. It’s frustrating to see them scrolling through their feeds while I’m trying to engage them in a discussion or a group activity.    I’m reaching out to see how other teachers are handling this issue. What strategies have you found effective in managing phone use in your classrooms? Have you found a balance between allowing technology for educational purposes while minimizing distractions? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you might have!

__label__1 I think we can all agree that rock bottom is a place we never want to visit, but sometimes it feels like a rite of passage. I hit my own version of rock bottom a few years ago when I lost my job, went through a breakup, and found myself in a deep depression. It felt like everything I had worked for was crumbling around me, and I was just stuck in this cycle of self-pity and despair.    But here’s the thing: hitting rock bottom can be a catalyst for change. For me, it forced me to confront my demons and take a hard look at my life. I started by seeking therapy, which was a game changer. Talking to someone who could help me untangle my thoughts and feelings was incredibly liberating. I also began to focus on my physical health—started exercising, eating better, and even picked up meditation.     I realized that I had to take small steps to rebuild my life. I started volunteering, which not only helped me feel connected to others but also gave me a sense of purpose. Slowly but surely, I began to regain my confidence. I took a few online courses to learn new skills, which eventually led to a new job that I actually love.     Looking back, I can see that rock bottom was a necessary part of my journey. It taught me resilience and the importance of self-care. I’m curious to hear from others—what was your rock bottom moment, and how did you manage to turn things around? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I have had this system for a few years now. Everything was working really well, 4 towers, 1 tower connected to desktop with ethernet, another tower connected to PS5 with ethernet in the basement. I was trying to increase the reception in the basement. I was told use the Deco app to optimize the network and enable IPV6. I did both of those and it did work my down and up speed in the basement improved significantly.     The problem is now my desktop is not able to connect using an ethernet cable, when I switch on the Wifi it is working fine. I changed the tower, ethernet cable, disabled IPV6 but still no connection. I am not sure what "optimizing the network" did but since that's the only thing I can't undo I assume it is related to that. I even tried to manually type the DNS information on my desktop (windows 10) and it still didn't work.     Does anyone have any advice? btw the PS5 that is also connected via an ethernet cable to a tower is working fine.
__label__1 Hey there! I'm a 26-year-old guy from Mississippi, and I'm looking to connect with someone for some good conversations. I used to be a NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), but I'm working on getting my life back on track and would love to chat with someone who can relate or just wants to talk about anything and everything.    A little about me: I enjoy gaming, watching movies, and diving into various topics like philosophy, science, and pop culture. I’m also a big fan of music and love discovering new artists. I’m open to discussing your interests too!

__label__1 Joker Sting was one of the most intriguing and memorable characters in TNA's history. When Sting adopted the Joker persona in 2010, it was a bold move that showcased his versatility as a performer. The character was a unique blend of the classic Sting persona and the chaotic, unpredictable nature of the Joker, which added a fresh layer to his already storied career.    The storyline surrounding Joker Sting was compelling, particularly his feud with Abyss and the way he manipulated the mind games throughout their rivalry. It was a departure from the traditional heroic Sting we were used to, and it allowed him to explore darker themes and showcase a more sinister side. The face paint, the mannerisms, and the overall presentation were spot on, making it a standout character in a time when TNA was trying to find its identity.    However, the character also had its critics. Some fans felt that it was a bit too over-the-top and strayed too far from what made Sting a beloved figure in wrestling. There were concerns that the gimmick overshadowed his wrestling ability and that it was more about the theatrics than the in-ring action.    Overall, I think Joker Sting was a fascinating experiment that added depth to Sting's legacy. It was a character that not only entertained but also sparked discussions about the evolution of wrestling personas. Looking back, it’s clear that Joker Sting was a significant moment in TNA's history, and it remains a topic of conversation among wrestling fans to this day.

__label__1 Lately, I've been going through a really tough time. It feels like I'm stuck in a dark place, and I can't seem to find my way out. I've been questioning everything, including my connection with my twin flame. Just when I thought I was completely lost, I started seeing the number 222 everywhere.     At first, I brushed it off as coincidence, but it kept appearing in the most unexpected places—on the clock, in phone numbers, even in random addresses. It felt like a sign, a gentle reminder that I’m not alone in this journey.     I did some research and learned that 222 is often associated with balance, harmony, and the idea of trusting the process. It’s like the universe is telling me to have faith, to keep my heart open, and to remember that my twin flame journey is still unfolding, even in the darkest moments.     Has anyone else experienced this? Seeing signs like 222 when you’re feeling low? How did it help you navigate through your challenges? I’d love to hear your stories and insights.
__label__1 I was at a bar the other night, and I overheard a couple of guys talking about their experiences with martial arts. One of them said, "Once you go Norris, you are physically unable to go back." I couldn't help but laugh because it sounded like some kind of weird relationship advice!     But then I started thinking about it. What if it was true? What if once you trained with Chuck Norris, you were forever changed? Like, you’d be walking down the street and suddenly feel the urge to roundhouse kick a tree just because you could.     Imagine the chaos! People would be trying to impress their friends by showing off their new skills, but instead, they’d end up kicking their coffee tables over or accidentally breaking their neighbor's fence.     And what if it applied to other things too? Like, once you’ve tasted the perfect slice of pizza, you can never go back to frozen pizza again. Or once you’ve seen a sunset in Hawaii, every other sunset just feels like a cheap knockoff.     So, I guess the moral of the story is: be careful what you get into, because once you go Norris, or pizza, or Hawaii, there’s no turning back!
__label__1 I've just started playing MultiVersus two days ago, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it! The character roster is diverse, and it's fun to see how different characters from various franchises interact with each other.     I’ve mainly been playing as Shaggy and Batman so far. Shaggy’s power-up mechanic is hilarious and really fun to use, while Batman’s gadgets add a unique twist to his gameplay. I’m still trying to get the hang of the mechanics, especially the dodge and combo systems, but I can see how they can lead to some really exciting plays.    I’ve also been exploring the different game modes, and I love how there’s something for everyone, whether you want to play casually or competitively.     For those who have been playing longer, do you have any tips for a newbie like me? Any characters you recommend I try out next? I’m eager to learn and improve!

__label__1 I recently had an experience at a restaurant where my friends and I were waiting a long time for our food. After about 30 minutes with no sign of our order, I started to get a bit anxious and noticed that we couldn't find our server anywhere. I considered getting up and going to the front to ask about our order, but I wasn't sure if that would be seen as rude or if it was acceptable in that situation.    So, I wanted to ask the community: Is it considered rude to leave your table and approach a server in person to inquire about your order status? If the food is delayed and you can't find anyone to help, is it better to just wait patiently for a server to come by, or is it okay to take matters into your own hands? What do you think is the best approach in these situations?

Has anyone else encountered this issue? Is there a fix or workaround that you can recommend? I really miss being able to communicate with my friends while we build together!
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I've recently upgraded from my Pixel 3 XL to the Pixel 7, and I was really excited about the camera improvements. However, I've been a bit disappointed with the results.     When I take photos, especially in low light, they seem grainy and not as sharp as I expected. I remember my Pixel 3 XL producing clearer images, and I thought the Pixel 7 would be a significant upgrade in that department.     I've tried adjusting the settings and using different modes, but the graininess persists. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any tips or settings I might be missing to improve the camera performance?     Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__1 I have a question regarding tax return deductions and I hope someone here can help clarify things for me.     I recently started a small side business while working full-time, and I want to make sure I'm maximizing my deductions when I file my taxes. I know that I can deduct certain expenses related to my business, but I'm unsure about how to categorize some of them.     For example, I use my personal vehicle for business purposes, and I’ve heard that I can either deduct the actual expenses or use the standard mileage rate. Which method is generally more beneficial? Also, are there specific records I need to keep to support these deductions?     Additionally, I’ve purchased some equipment and supplies for my business. Can I deduct the full cost in the year I purchase them, or do I need to depreciate them over time?     Any advice or resources you could point me to would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been really curious about how different gacha games are perceived by players, especially since there are so many out there with varying mechanics, art styles, and monetization strategies. I thought it would be interesting to conduct a little survey to gather some insights from the community.     Here are a few questions to consider:  1. What gacha games are you currently playing, and what drew you to them?  2. How do you feel about the monetization practices in your favorite gacha games? Are they fair, or do they feel exploitative?  3. What aspects of a gacha game do you value the most? (e.g., story, character design, gameplay mechanics, community, etc.)  4. Have you ever quit a gacha game? If so, what were the reasons?  5. How important is the frequency of updates and new content to your enjoyment of a gacha game?    Feel free to answer any or all of these questions! I think it would be great to see a variety of perspectives and maybe even identify some trends in what players love or dislike about their gacha experiences. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
__label__1 So I just finished my first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 and I’m feeling pretty accomplished! I managed to take down all the Lords of Cinder, but now I’m thinking about going back and fighting some of the bosses again.     I’ve heard that fighting them a second time can be a different experience, especially with the added challenge of New Game Plus. I’m particularly interested in how their attack patterns might change and if they have any new moves or strategies I should be aware of.     For those of you who have done this, what was your experience like? Did you find it more enjoyable, or was it just a frustrating repeat? Any tips on how to approach these fights again? I’m especially curious about the likes of Abyss Watchers and Nameless King.     Thanks in advance for any advice!
__label__1 "Especially In Michigan" is such a hauntingly beautiful track. The way Anthony Kiedis delivers the lyrics really captures that sense of longing and nostalgia. The imagery he paints about the cold, desolate landscapes of Michigan resonates deeply, especially for those of us who have experienced the harsh winters there.     Musically, the blend of John Frusciante's guitar work and Flea's bass lines creates this atmospheric sound that perfectly complements the lyrics. It’s a bit different from their more upbeat tracks, but that’s what I love about the Chili Peppers – they can evoke such a wide range of emotions through their music.     I also appreciate how the song reflects on themes of love and loss, which is something many of us can relate to. It’s a reminder of how places can hold memories and feelings that linger long after we’ve left.     What do you all think? Does this song hit you in the feels as much as it does for me?
__label__1 I finally did it. After months of contemplating, I deleted my Facebook account. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, but at the same time, I’m feeling a mix of relief and anxiety.     The decision came after my recent breakup. I found myself constantly scrolling through my ex’s profile, looking at pictures, and torturing myself with memories that I should be letting go of. It was unhealthy, and I knew it. I realized that every time I logged in, I was just reopening old wounds.     I also noticed how much time I was wasting on social media, comparing my life to others and feeling inadequate. I want to focus on my healing and rediscover who I am outside of a relationship.     I know it’s going to be tough at first. I’ll miss the connection with friends and family, but I’m hoping to replace that with real-life interactions. I want to invest my energy into things that truly matter and bring me joy.     Has anyone else taken the plunge and deleted their social media after a breakup? How did it go for you? Any tips on how to cope with the initial withdrawal?
__label__1 I've been trying to slim down and get healthier, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the information out there.

Are there specific foods you found helpful or workouts that you enjoyed? How do you stay motivated, especially on days when you just don’t feel like it?     Also, how do you balance the desire to lose weight with the importance of body positivity and self-acceptance? I want to approach this journey in a healthy way, both physically and mentally. Any advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been diving deep into Immortal Empires in Total War: Warhammer 3, and I've noticed something that’s been bothering me. It seems like the AI has some sort of advantage when it comes to movement stances, especially when it comes to ambushes and rapid repositioning.    For instance, I’ll be moving my armies through enemy territory, trying to set up ambushes or just maneuver strategically, and it feels like the AI can see right through my plans. They seem to know exactly when to switch to ambush stance or when to retreat, even when I think I have them cornered.     Has anyone else experienced this? It feels like the AI is able to predict my movements with uncanny accuracy, and I can’t help but wonder if there’s some hidden mechanic at play.     I love the challenge, but sometimes it feels a bit unfair. What are your thoughts? Is this just a part of the game’s design, or do you think the AI is getting a little too much help? Any tips on how to counter this would also be appreciated!

His entire body was pain, all his muscles were on fire and he lost feeling in his hands and feet. Every part of his body was screaming in agony. He was sure he was going to die.    "Oh cosmos, please somebody kill me..."    And then there was Mark, kneeling next to him, with that goddamn smirk on his face    "Oh come on 'Teshie, the workout wasnt that bad now, was it...?"    The smirk faded from his face after Sitesh started having a coughing fit    "Ah shit, I'm so sorry 'Teshie, I think I'm so used to my usual routine that i might've pushed you too much. Ahhh fuck I'm useless, please don't be mad at me."    It took a few seconds for Sitesh to recover his breath. He could slowly feel the numbness fade from his limbs and the aches were subsiding as well, even if not as fast as he hoped.    "No no no, do not blame yourself for anything. I am just not used to this much rigorous exercise; the most i've gotten before was briskly walking through the scribes academy throughout the day back at home. You clearly meant well with your offer and even if it leaves me well exhausted...", he lifted himself slowly from the floor into a sitting position, which was accompanied with a rather loud crack from his shoulder region, "...oh cosmos have mercy. I still enjoyed it and I am considering signing up for a regular schedule in this gymnasium. I feel it would benefit me, what with me now being on board of a science vessel traveling deep into unexplored space and the dangers that may lie ahead. Thank you very much, mark"    He could see the happiness return to marks face, as well as a slight reddening of his cheeks.    "Plus, as humans say: "what doesnt kill me makes me stronger""    "Ay, I see you're starting to get a hang of human phrases; odd that the first one you would use is Nietzsche but hey, I'm very happy you're getting comfortable on this ship".    While he immediately regretted not taking his sweet time standing up slowly, his entire body screaming in protest, Sitesh still had work to do for the day and his shift was starting soon.    "now while I would love to continue our conversation mark, I must tend to my work soon and truth be told, my, uh, backside is yearning for a chair for the next few hours, so unfortunately I must go, if my legs permit me. I am looking forward to talk to you again"    Mark was now visibly slightly saddened and Sitesh started to worry he might have been to cold to his friend. He already felt like he was pushing Mark away ever so slightly today ever since the revelation about him having a "crush" on him yesterday. not out of malice, of course, but because he was lost in thought about it and simply did not know how to approach the matter yet. He was relieved when he saw the almost signature positivity return to Marks face.    "Oh hey, no problem man, I should probably also get back to the dispatch station. you never know when the next person burns themselves with a welding torch and needs a medic to get them first aid. Oh and there is one more thing."    "Oh? And what is that?"    "would you be interested to visit me in my quarters after our shifts, maybe on a drink and listen to some music from our respective people. Or we could play some video games or watch a film. I feel like you always just slip away into your quarters after your shift and I felt like it would be nice to offer you a good time between friends"    Now this was new. Yes it was true that while he usually did partake in some group activities with the other people on the ship, Sitesh never really did so with just one person, usually retreating to his personal space after shifts for meditation and reflection. He could feel his heart beating faster and was almost scared that Mark could somehow hear it. he thanked the cosmos a second time for not being able to sweat like humans do when they get into situations like these. If John hadn't said what he said yesterday, Sitesh might not have thought more of it, but he knew this was more than just about having a nice evening with a friend for Mark. He was glad that any sign of nervousness was cloaked by his exhaustion from the exercise.    "Well, I don't know. It certainly does sound intriguing and on principle I wouldn't know a reason why not. however I would like a bit of time to decide, if you permit"    Again through his observation he noticed subdued excitement going through Marks body, and with a slightly higher voice and a sudden, slight, stutter, Mark replied:    "Hey, no pressure, 'Teshie. Just take your time and think about it. if you do decide to accept, you can contact me under this ID; I'll send it to your DataPad. Give it a thought and if you want to, just give me a ring, alright?"    Sitesh felt his DataPad vibrate in the pocket of his trousers, notifying him of a new contact having been added and again he felt another rise in his heartbeat because of it.    "Anyway, thank you Mark for your company. I will certainly consider your offer while I work. For now I think I should get going. As for you, I wish you good luck and the grace of the cosmos during your shift."    "Right back at you, buddy."    His shift was almost over, and Sitesh still hadn't fully thought about what he felt about this situation. The cataloguing and sorting of scientific data usually was a rather dull affair, permitting full reflection while doing it, however today was a lot busier than usual, as the *Limoncello* recently completed its full scan of a space anomaly that took 12 hours and the amount of data gathered was rather monumental. He certainly felt *something* in his interactions with Mark ever since yesterdays revelation, and he was certain it was not rejection. Truth be told he had not felt like this ever since his days at the Academy, where he harboured certain feelings for a childhood friend that was in the same lecture as him. However this was different. This was two people from two different species which have not until recently made first contact and started the integration programme engaging with each other. Those factors aside Sitesh also wasn't sure how well he would actually fully take on particular human mannerisms in such a short time, as this kind of relationship would require. It made him anxious of making mistakes and possibly permanently damaging his friendship with Mark. He noticed that he had stopped working, and that he must have been staring at the DataPad on his desk for a few minutes now, deeply lost in thought. This would spell the most monumental decision in his life and possibly even the history of his people and humanity. Sitesh tried to get back to work but he caught himself constantly staring back at the DataPad and being unable to continue his tasks, so he decided to think it about for a few more minutes until a decision was made.    &amp;#x200B;    After what felt like an eternity to him he looked back at the DataPad.    &amp;#x200B;    &amp;#x200B;    &amp;#x200B;    He decided to pick it up and tapped on the contact list...    To be continued?    &amp;#x200B;    *Hope those that liked the first part also enjoyed this one. I do try my best to put effort in my grammar and the rest as much as i can not being a fully native english speaker, but im not used to writing stuff like this, given that its my 2nd ever thing i have written for this sub, but i am fully happy for any and all input. depending on how invested i feel in it, i might consider writing more, but for now im gonna take a little break.*    *For reference, if you want to imagine what Sitesh's people look like, imagine the argonians from skyrim, but, well, sci fi lol.*
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’ve been exploring the world of sex toys lately, and I’m particularly curious about butt plugs. I’ve heard they can enhance pleasure for both men and women, but I’m not sure where to start.     For those who have experience with butt plugs, what are some tips you would give to beginners? Are there specific types or sizes that you recommend for men versus women?     Also, how do you incorporate them into your sexual experiences? Do you use them solo, with a partner, or both? Any advice on how to make the experience more enjoyable would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__1 I wanted to share an important update for anyone who plays Evil Dead: The Game on their Steam Deck or any Linux system. As of June 2022, the game introduced Easy Anti-Cheat, which unfortunately has broken support for Linux users. This means that if you're trying to play the game on your Steam Deck, you will find it completely unplayable due to this change.    For those who might not be aware, Easy Anti-Cheat is a service that helps prevent cheating in online games, but it doesn't currently support Linux. This has led to a lot of frustration in the community, as many players were enjoying the game on their devices prior to this update.    If you're looking for alternatives or workarounds, I recommend keeping an eye on forums and the Steam community for any potential fixes or updates from the developers. In the meantime, it might be worth exploring other games that are more Linux-friendly.     Stay tuned for any news, and hopefully, we can get back to slaying Deadites soon!
__label__0 I am playing Festus, and my vassal Moulder built an outpost in the Brass Keep. The problem is that his skavenslaves replaced my chaos warriors since the garrison was at 20 units. Allied outpost units should add to the garrison capacity, so there would be 20 chaos garrison units and 3 extra skaven units for a total of 23. A small quality of life change that would be appreciated.
__label__1 Hello everyone,    I’m having a bit of a strange issue with my WireGuard setup on my macOS client. I’ve been using WireGuard for a while now, and it has been working great, but recently I’ve noticed that after connecting to my VPN, the Endpoint IP seems to switch between different past configurations shortly after establishing the connection.    Here’s a bit of context:  - I have multiple configurations saved for different servers, and I switch between them depending on my needs.  - When I connect to a specific configuration, I can see that the Endpoint IP is correct initially, but then it changes to an IP from a previous configuration after a few seconds.  - This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes it happens, and sometimes it doesn’t.    Here’s a snippet of my WireGuard configuration for reference:    ```  [Interface]  PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY  Address = 10.0.0.2/24  DNS = 1.1.1.1    [Peer]  PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY  Endpoint = server.example.com:51820  AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0  PersistentKeepalive = 25  ```    I’ve checked the following:  1. **Configuration Files**: I’ve ensured that there are no duplicate entries or misconfigurations in my WireGuard configuration files.  2. **Network Settings**: I’ve looked into my macOS network settings to see if there’s anything unusual, but everything seems normal.  3. **Logs**: I’ve checked the WireGuard logs, but they don’t seem to indicate any errors or issues when the IP switches.    Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a way to prevent the Endpoint IP from switching to a previous configuration? I’m worried that this might lead to potential security issues or connectivity problems.    Thanks in advance for any help or insights you can provide!

I’ve been walking with it, feeding it, and playing with it, but it seems like the hearts just aren’t adding up.

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m planning to take acid for the first time this weekend and I’m looking for some advice to make the experience as enjoyable and safe as possible. I’ve done a bit of research, but I’d love to hear from those who have experience.     Here are a few specific questions I have:  1. **Setting**: What’s the best environment for a first trip? Should I be outdoors, or is it better to stay indoors?   2. **Mindset**: How important is it to have a positive mindset going in? Any tips on how to prepare mentally?   3. **Dosage**: What’s a good starting dose for a beginner? I’ve heard different things, so I want to make sure I don’t overdo it.   4. **Duration**: How long should I expect the effects to last? I want to make sure I have enough time set aside.   5. **Safety**: Any safety tips or things to avoid while tripping?     I’m really excited but also a bit nervous, so any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Something that hasn't really been an issue so much until H4 has become more and more apparent.     Groups that have a high resonance player and therefore high CR player from the juiced up 5/5 star gems are receiving significantly less set item and legendary item drops than groups that do not.         When I say significantly less, I've been able to record each of my daily runs for the past several weeks. On average it is between 9-11.5% set item drop chance, with the volume of runs being around 65-80 on a weekday, and 95-135 on a weekend. Some dungeons will result in 21-26 runs at a time before getting a single green item to drop.        Additionally, based on data collected from myself(5k reso player) and a discord community of another 40+ 5k resonance players, it would appear like we are also unable to or EXTREMELY-unlikely-to ever acquire any 3/3 Attrib/Magic exceptional set items. With the majority of us having 0 or 1 3/3 despite farming literally THOUSANDS of dungeons...        Things tried to work around this:     Un-socketing gems to reduce resonance to below all other players.     Variations between High reso player lead/starting the dungeon and low reso lead/starting the dungeon    Running dungeons as 2/4 players instead of 4/4 full group    Saying stupid things in chat like "I wish Bobby Kotick was my real dad" or "I can't wait to spend more money" in the hopes that some Blizz/NetEase dev will feel sorry for us while they're monitoring chat and will do something to give us a set item drop.     JUST DOING MORE DUNGEONS        Finally, and probably the worst effect noticed:        There's an effect not just on the whaler in the group and their drops, but to everyone else in the group as well. Every group has reported never seeing as bad of drop rates as the ones received when grouping with a whaler. This is getting to the point where people just refuse to party up because they're under the impression that even though the runs are quick, the rewards will be non-existent.         Things I'd love to see as an outcome of reporting this issue:         * Actual confirmation on what exactly the set item drop chance is  * Exact details on all factors built in to determining drop chances for set item  * Similar to the released "daily bonus factors for lego drops" where there wasn't "a cap" but there were bonus things such as first orange of the day, 400% drop chance on first 4 yellow mobs to drop a legendary... Any other "bonus factors" that contribute or don't contribute to someone receiving a set item.         u/pezradar I am hopeful that this is something you can have looked into. Happy to provide any information to support these observations.
__label__1 I just saw the announcement that No Man's Sky is finally coming to Mac! 🎉 As a long-time player on PC, I’m super excited to see this game make its way to the Mac community.     For those of you who have played it on PC, what are your thoughts on how it will run on Mac? Do you think the performance will hold up? I know there are some concerns about graphics and optimization, especially with the vastness of the universe and all the procedural generation.     Also, for any Mac users out there, what are you most looking forward to? Exploring new planets, building bases, or maybe just the sheer beauty of the game?     Let’s discuss! What are your hopes for this release?
__label__0 So before I start, I’m sure this is really small and unimportant compared to most of the other posts on this subreddit. Me (15M) and my parents (50M&amp;F) constantly argue and I’m starting to sort of feel like the AH. Every week I’m expected to do yard work at least 3-4 days of the week especially on Saturday (not complaining just introducing some context) and I honestly don’t mind yard work all that much. Every Saturday we will start working and often my dad will ask me to do a few jobs but only tells me the first, and when I ask what the upcoming jobs are he just says “you don’t need to know” and when i tell him that I’m just trying to prepare for the amount of time it will take, he goes ballistic. He takes this as talking back and arguing and punishes me for it by taking my phone (effectively grounding me from friends) and takes away MY PC for weeks at a time that I spent over half a year making the money to build. He then calls me spoiled and any time I try to consult my mom about it she just says she doesn’t want to talk to me and that I should just respect my father. Maybe he doesn’t want to tell me whats next because i used to complain about doing work back when i was like 10 and sometimes I have some angst on weekdays due to being really tired or busy with school, but I actually enjoy doing work now and it seems like he treats me the same? This may be stupid but AITA?
__label__1 I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich from a popular fast food chain, and when I took a bite, I immediately noticed something was off. The texture was mushy, and it didn’t taste right. I pulled the sandwich apart, and to my horror, the chicken was still pink and slimy in the middle! I couldn’t believe it. I went back to the counter to show them, and the employee just shrugged and said, "It’s fine, it’s just the seasoning." I asked for a refund, but they insisted that it was cooked properly. I ended up leaving without my money back and feeling nauseous. How can they serve something like that and not care? It’s so infuriating!
__label__1 I’m currently 24 weeks pregnant and I’ve been feeling increasingly uneasy about my OB. At first, I thought everything was fine, but now I’m starting to feel like my concerns aren’t being taken seriously.     During my last appointment, I brought up some symptoms I’ve been experiencing, like persistent back pain and some swelling in my feet. Instead of discussing them in detail, my OB just brushed them off as normal pregnancy discomforts. I understand that pregnancy comes with its own set of challenges, but I feel like I deserve to have my concerns addressed more thoroughly.     Additionally, I’ve noticed that my OB seems rushed during appointments, and I often leave feeling like I didn’t get a chance to ask all my questions. I’ve also heard from friends that they had more personalized care with their doctors, which makes me wonder if I should be looking for someone else.     Has anyone else felt this way during their pregnancy? How did you handle it? Should I consider switching doctors, or is it normal to feel this way? I just want to make sure I’m getting the best care for myself and my baby.

__label__0 The great outdoors will improve your mental health and overall vitality further than any therapist or pharmacist could ever.    Too many people are discouraged by aging, and they end up adopting a fatalistic attitude towards exercise. Here is the deal... aging certainly affects our bodies, but we retain the capacity to adapt to our environments for our whole lives. If you haven't been training, or have been living in an unhealthy way, can ALWAYS improve. Change your environment, and you will change your adaptations. You get ONE SHOT, so do everything you can to stack the deck in your favor. TRAIN!

__label__0 I am waiting on an EDS diagnosis but I have Hypermobility. I’m not asking for medical help, but I am asking if opioids have helped anyone and if anyone has been able to advocate for themselves to get them to help alleviate the pain. I am 22, female, and want to have a full life. Is there anyone who uses any opioids for EDS or Hypermobility, and has it helped ?    Edit: thank you everyone for your amazing answers. Please keep them coming if you are new to this post! I need as much input as possible. I’m doing my own research and will be talking with my doctor about this and my pain doctor about this. I need my pain to, if not go away, then decrease by a lot. I want my life to be almost normal again. I’m tired of hurting from doing nothing. I want to pet my cat like I used to.  I want to drive long distances. I want to go from my normal 6/7 out of 10 to a 2/3 out of 10. I don’t think that’s too much to ask for in this life at this point. Been over a year of constant pain and I just want some relief other than when I’m sleeping.

__label__1 I've been thinking about starting a mastermind group for entrepreneurs in my area, and I wanted to share some thoughts and gather feedback from this community.     For those who may not be familiar, a mastermind group is a peer-to-peer mentoring group where members share their challenges, successes, and insights to help each other grow both personally and professionally. The idea is to create a supportive environment where we can hold each other accountable and brainstorm solutions to our business problems.    Here’s what I envision for the group:  1. **Regular Meetings**: We would meet bi-weekly, either in person or virtually, to discuss our progress, set goals, and tackle any obstacles we’re facing.  2. **Diverse Backgrounds**: I want to include entrepreneurs from various industries to bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. This diversity can spark creativity and innovation.  3. **Structured Agenda**: Each meeting would have a structured agenda to ensure we stay focused. We could allocate time for each member to present their current challenges and receive feedback from the group.  4. **Guest Speakers**: Occasionally, we could invite successful entrepreneurs or industry experts to share their insights and experiences, which could provide additional value to our discussions.  5. **Networking Opportunities**: Beyond the meetings, I hope to foster connections among members for potential collaborations, partnerships, or simply to expand our professional networks.    I believe that being part of a mastermind group can significantly accelerate our growth and help us navigate the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.     Has anyone here been part of a mastermind group? What was your experience like? Any tips on how to structure it effectively or common pitfalls to avoid? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 In the quiet corners of my mind, torment lingers,    A shadowed whisper, a dance of fingers,    Tracing the scars of battles fought,    In the silence of night, I’m caught,      Each thought a dagger, each memory a chain,    I wear my anguish like a badge of pain,    The echoes of laughter, now distant and cold,    A story of sorrow, too heavy to hold.      I wander through mazes of what could have been,    Chasing the ghosts of the places I’ve seen,    The faces of friends, now faded and blurred,    Their voices a symphony, too soft to be heard.      Yet in this torment, a flicker of light,    A spark of resilience ignites in the night,    For every wound that has bled me dry,    Is a testament to strength, a reason to fly.      So I gather my pieces, the shattered remains,    And weave them together, despite all the pains,    For in the depths of despair, I find my own song,    A melody born from the places I’ve gone.      Torment may linger, but it won’t define,    The spirit that rises, the heart that will shine,    In the tapestry woven from threads of my strife,    I’ll dance with my demons, and reclaim my life.

__label__1 In God of War (2018), there's a moment that has been bothering me and I can't decide if it's a plot hole or just a case of poor writing. When Kratos and Atreus are trying to reach the peak of the mountain to spread Faye's ashes, they encounter several challenges, including the fight with the stranger and the various creatures of Norse mythology.     However, one thing that stands out is how Kratos, a god who has fought and defeated countless foes, seems to struggle with the idea of teaching Atreus how to fight. He often pushes Atreus away, insisting that he must learn to be strong on his own. Yet, when they face the stranger, Kratos is quick to jump in and protect Atreus, showing that he is more than capable of fighting alongside him.     This makes me wonder: why not just train Atreus properly from the start? Is it a matter of Kratos wanting to protect his son from the harsh realities of their world, or is it just a narrative device to create tension and drama? It feels inconsistent with Kratos's character, who has always been a warrior and a teacher in his own right.     What do you all think? Is this a plot hole, or does it serve a deeper purpose in Kratos's character development?

__label__1 I want to start by saying that I understand the thoughts I’m having are deeply troubling and not something I condone or want to act on. I’ve been grappling with these fantasies for a while now, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to manage them. I know that these thoughts are harmful and objectifying, and they don’t reflect the kind of person I want to be.    I’ve been trying to explore where these feelings are coming from. I think it might stem from a combination of societal pressures, personal insecurities, and perhaps a desire for control in my life. I’ve always been drawn to traditional gender roles, but I realize that my fantasies are not just about wanting a partner; they’re about power and possession, which is not healthy.    I’m reaching out to this community because I want to understand how to cope with these thoughts. I don’t want to hurt anyone or act on these impulses. I’m considering talking to a therapist to help me work through these feelings and find healthier ways to express my desires. Has anyone else experienced similar thoughts? How did you deal with them? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I recently saw the Simon’s MAiD commercial and it left me feeling a bit confused. For those who might not know, MAiD stands for Medical Assistance in Dying, which is a legal option in Canada for individuals who are suffering from grievous and irremediable medical conditions. The commercial seems to present this topic in a very emotional and personal way, showcasing stories of individuals who have chosen this path.    I’m curious about a few things:   1. Why is this topic being commercialized? Is it to raise awareness, or is there a specific agenda behind it?   2. How do people generally feel about the portrayal of such a sensitive subject in a commercial format?   3. Are there any regulations or guidelines around how these types of topics can be presented in advertisements?    I’d love to hear thoughts from others who have seen the commercial or have insights into the broader implications of discussing MAiD in this way.

__label__1 I've been following the IRS hiring process for a while now, and I'm curious if anyone has any updates or insights on how things are progressing. I applied for a position a few months ago and have been waiting to hear back. I've seen some posts about delays and changes in hiring practices, especially with the recent budget discussions and staffing needs.     If anyone has recently gone through the interview process or received any communication from the IRS, I would love to hear about your experience. Are they still actively hiring, or have things slowed down? Any information would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 The idea of the Big Bang as the origin of our universe is a well-established theory in cosmology, suggesting that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. However, the concept of multiple "big bangs" or a cyclical universe is a fascinating topic that has been explored in various theoretical frameworks.    One possibility is the idea of a multiverse, where our universe is just one of many, each potentially having its own Big Bang event. In this scenario, there could be other universes that have formed through similar processes, leading to a vast collection of universes with different physical laws and constants.    Another intriguing concept is the cyclic model of the universe, which posits that the universe undergoes infinite cycles of expansion and contraction. In this model, after a Big Crunch, where the universe collapses back into a singularity, a new Big Bang could occur, leading to a new phase of expansion. This would mean that the universe we observe today is just one iteration in an endless series of cosmic cycles.    As for the idea that the Big Bang could be a massive group of stars and galaxies, it's important to note that the Big Bang theory describes the entire universe's expansion from a singular state, rather than a localized event involving existing stars and galaxies. However, the formation of stars and galaxies did occur after the initial expansion, as the universe cooled and matter began to coalesce.    In summary, while the traditional Big Bang theory describes the beginning of our universe, the concepts of a multiverse or cyclic universe suggest that there could be more to the story. These ideas challenge our understanding of cosmology and open up exciting avenues for further research and exploration.

__label__0       I wanted to like know if AI researchers are expected to know django/ flask apart from Pytorch / tensorflow  Since there's already pytorch live for creating APIs I think,  I can learn Java/springboot and also focus on learning libraries+ pytorch , while doing masters? Since Java is r ally required for employment here incase things don't go my way and I am not able to secure ML position.    Else if flask / django is needed I shall learn that instead of spring boot    Or if it's better to start as data engineer learning pyspark and stuff??    Edit: I am targetting for positions in labs like deep genomics/ embl/ Max Planck institute, biogen, may be CERN also ( they are ambitious list,ost probably I won't get but I want to work for them)    Thank you!

__label__1 I know I'm not the only one who feels this way! Michelle Waterson is a talented fighter, but her fights can sometimes feel a bit slow-paced. I appreciate her skills and her heart in the octagon, but I can't help but think that a quick nap might be more exciting than watching her dance around the cage for 15 minutes. Anyone else planning to catch some Z's during her next fight? Or do you think she’ll surprise us with a finish this time?

__label__1 I recently participated in my company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and have been trying to figure out the best strategy for selling the shares once they vest. I understand that there are a few factors to consider, such as tax implications, market conditions, and my overall investment strategy.    Currently, I have a few shares that I purchased at a discount, and I’m wondering if I should sell them immediately after the holding period to lock in the gains, or if I should hold onto them for a longer period in hopes that the stock price will increase further.     I’ve read that selling immediately can help avoid the risk of a downturn, but I also know that holding onto the shares could potentially yield higher returns if the company performs well. Additionally, I’m aware of the tax implications of selling shares right away versus holding them longer, especially regarding short-term vs. long-term capital gains.    For those of you who have experience with ESPP shares, what strategies have you found effective? How do you decide when to sell? Any insights on balancing the risks and rewards would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 The title.    I’ve played TF2 for 2800 hours and I’m still terrible at Spy. I’m pretty good at most other classes - Heavy, Demo, Scout, Sniper - but I’m just a garbage Spy. I’ve been playing him more and more recently because I really want to learn how to play him but I simply can’t. I don’t know if it’s really terrible luck or if I just can’t decloak right, but I never get anything done as Spy. It’s beyond frustrating and I want to give up. The fact that people like Swipez and Paladin exist simply feels fake to me.
__label__1 I recently moved out of my apartment after my lease ended, and I was under the impression that I had fulfilled all my obligations. However, I received a bill from my former landlord stating that I owe additional charges for cleaning and repairs that they claim were necessary after I vacated the unit.     I took care to clean the apartment thoroughly and documented its condition with photos before I left. The landlord did not conduct a walkthrough with me at the time of my move-out, which I thought was standard practice. Now, they are demanding payment for these charges, and I’m unsure of my rights in this situation.     Can they legally charge me for these expenses after the lease has ended? What steps can I take to dispute these charges? I would like to avoid any legal action if possible, but I also want to protect myself from being unfairly charged. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I can't believe it, I just got betrayed by scavs for the fifth time this wipe! I was feeling pretty good about my run on Customs, had a decent loadout and was ready to hit some loot spots. I even had a couple of good encounters with other players, but nothing too crazy.     So there I was, creeping through the warehouses, when I spotted a group of scavs. I thought, "Great, I can take them out and loot their bodies for some extra gear!" I took my time, lined up my shots, and dropped one of them. But then, out of nowhere, the remaining scavs turned on me! I thought they were supposed to be friendly if you don’t shoot first, but nope! They lit me up before I even had a chance to react.     This isn’t the first time this has happened this wipe. I’ve been trying to play more cautiously, but it seems like every time I encounter scavs, they just decide to go rogue. I get that it’s part of the game, but it’s so frustrating!     Has anyone else been experiencing this? Is there a trick to avoid getting betrayed by scavs, or is it just the nature of the beast? I’m starting to feel like I can’t trust anyone in this game, even the AI! Any tips or stories would be appreciated!

__label__1 I am currently working on my university capstone project, which is a significant component of my degree program. As part of this project, I am required to log a certain number of hours dedicated to project management activities to fulfill my PMP certification requirements.     The project involves developing a mobile application aimed at improving student engagement on campus. I have been managing a small team of fellow students, and we are in the process of defining our project scope, creating a project plan, and establishing timelines.     However, I am finding it challenging to track my hours effectively while also ensuring that my team stays on task and meets our deadlines. I want to make sure that I am documenting my project management activities accurately to meet the requirements for my PMP hours.     Here are a few questions I have:  1. What are the best practices for logging project management hours in a university setting?  2. How can I balance the need to document my hours while also focusing on the execution of the project?  3. Are there any tools or templates that you would recommend for tracking project management activities and hours?    Any advice or insights from those who have navigated similar situations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 In Chinese culture, there are indeed foods and drinks that are associated with dreaming and the concept of dreams in general. One notable example is the use of **lotus seeds**. Lotus seeds are often consumed in various forms, such as in soups or desserts, and are believed to promote calmness and tranquility, which can lead to peaceful dreams.     Additionally, **goji berries** are another food that is sometimes linked to dreams. They are known for their health benefits and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine to improve overall well-being, which can indirectly influence the quality of one's dreams.     As for drinks, **chrysanthemum tea** is popular in Chinese culture and is often consumed for its calming effects. It is believed that drinking this tea before bed can help induce a restful sleep and pleasant dreams.     Moreover, in some regions, people might consume **rice wine** or **sweet red bean soup** as a nighttime treat, which is thought to promote good sleep and, by extension, good dreams.     Overall, while there may not be a specific food or drink solely dedicated to dreaming, many traditional Chinese foods and beverages are associated with promoting relaxation and restful sleep, which can enhance the dream experience.
__label__1 I recently had my 2015 WRX (CVT) inspected by a local Subaru dealership for a potential buyer, and they found a couple of issues that I wasn't aware of.     First, they mentioned that there’s a small oil leak coming from the front crank seal. I had never noticed any oil spots under the car, so this was a surprise to me. They quoted me around $500 for the repair, which seems reasonable, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had this issue and how serious it is?     The second issue was with the brake pads. They said that the front pads are worn down to about 20% and should be replaced soon. I thought they were still in decent shape, but I guess I should have checked them more closely.     Has anyone else had similar experiences with their WRX? How did you handle these repairs? I want to be transparent with the potential buyer, but I also want to make sure I’m not overpaying for repairs that might not be urgent. Thanks in advance for any advice!
__label__0 Hello! I finally got my Miller Cat Shield installed at a local Midas yesterday. Took her for a drive this morning and experienced a fair amount of rattling (starting up after a stop, with bumps, etc). Has anyone else run into this? Have you found any solutions to stop or at least minimize it? It makes me feel like the car’s going to fall apart; really takes the serenity out of my drives!    *Edit: I'm also using an aftermarket cat! It looks like Miller says they can't guarantee no rattling unless it's OEM, but I gotta think this is still preventable.
__label__1 I've been reflecting on my experiences with group projects in my CS classes, and I can't help but notice how challenging it can be to work effectively in teams with other CS students. I wanted to share my thoughts and hear if anyone else has had similar experiences or insights.    First off, I think one of the main issues is the varying levels of commitment and work ethic among team members. In a typical CS class, you might have some students who are super passionate and dedicated, while others might just be coasting through. This disparity can lead to frustration when some members are putting in a lot of effort while others are not contributing equally.    Another factor is the different skill levels and backgrounds. CS is such a broad field, and not everyone has the same strengths. For example, some might excel in algorithms while others are better at front-end development. This can create a situation where team members feel out of their depth or unsure about how to contribute, leading to a lack of communication and collaboration.    Additionally, I think many CS students are used to working independently on coding assignments and projects. The shift to teamwork can be jarring, as it requires a different set of skills, like communication, compromise, and conflict resolution. Some students might struggle with this transition, leading to misunderstandings and tension within the group.    Lastly, I wonder if the competitive nature of the field plays a role. Many of us are aiming for internships and jobs at top tech companies, and there can be a sense of competition even within our own teams. This can make it hard to foster a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and asking for help.    Has anyone else experienced these challenges? How have you navigated teamwork in your CS classes? Any tips for making group projects more successful?
__label__1 I've been using my Dell Inspiron 15 5567 for a few years now, and while it has served me well, I'm starting to notice some performance issues and wear and tear. I'm looking for a replacement that can handle everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and some light gaming, but I also want something that will last a few years without becoming obsolete.    Here are some of my requirements:  - **Screen Size**: I prefer a 15-inch display, but I'm open to 14-inch if the laptop is lightweight and portable.  - **Performance**: At least an Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a decent SSD (512GB or more).  - **Battery Life**: Good battery life is essential since I often work remotely or in coffee shops.  - **Build Quality**: I’d like something that feels sturdy and can withstand daily use.  - **Budget**: Ideally under $1,200, but I can stretch a bit for the right laptop.    I've been looking at options like the Lenovo IdeaPad 5, HP Pavilion 15, and the ASUS VivoBook series. Any recommendations or experiences with these models? Or is there something else I should consider?     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 DCC are upgrading the water mains in fairview which has diverted inbound motor traffic to a parallel road.  Outbound is uninterrupted.  Buses, taxis and active travellers are uninterrupted in both directions.  They are taking the opportunity to improve the bus and cycle lanes during this period because it would cause less intrusion.     Irish Times and RTÉ are framing it as ‘banning cars’ and ‘traumatic’ to build a cycle lane.   This is incorrect and designed to stir outrage. Residents are saying they were never consulted (it’s been planned for years).    I’ve very little hope for larger scale projects to get off the ground but minor inconveniences like this make my blood boil.
__label__1 Hi everyone!     I’m reaching out because I’m looking for some advice and support from those of you who are sexually active. I’ve been in a relationship for a while now, and while things are going well, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with some aspects of my sexual health and intimacy.     Firstly, I’ve been experiencing some discomfort during sex, and I’m not sure if it’s normal or if I should be concerned. I’ve tried different positions and taken my time, but sometimes it still feels uncomfortable. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to address it?     Additionally, I’m curious about how you all manage birth control. I’m currently on the pill, but I’ve been thinking about switching to an IUD or another method. What has your experience been like with different forms of birth control? Any recommendations or things to watch out for?     Lastly, I’d love to hear about how you communicate with your partner about your needs and boundaries. I sometimes struggle with being open about what feels good or what doesn’t, and I want to improve that aspect of my relationship.     Thank you in advance for any advice or support you can offer! I really appreciate it.

__label__1 I know this might sound strange or even disgusting to some, but I hope you’ll take a moment to read my story. My name is Sarah, and I’m reaching out for help during a time that has been incredibly challenging for my family and me.    A few months ago, my beloved dog, Max, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. He has been my companion for over 8 years, and the thought of losing him is unbearable. Max has always been there for me through thick and thin, and I want to do everything I can to give him a fighting chance.    The treatment options available are costly, and I’ve already exhausted my savings trying to cover his initial vet bills. The chemotherapy and medications he needs to prolong his life and keep him comfortable are beyond my financial reach. I’ve set up a GoFundMe page in hopes of raising enough funds to cover his treatment and any necessary follow-up care.    I understand that not everyone may feel the same way about pets as I do, but to me, Max is family. He deserves a chance to fight this battle, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to help him. If you can find it in your heart to contribute, even a small amount, it would mean the world to me and to Max.     Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for considering helping us in our time of need. Here’s the link to the GoFundMe page: [insert link]. Any support, whether financial or simply sharing this post, is greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I was just minding my own business, sailing around the Sea of Thieves, when out of nowhere, Kiwibeard and his crew of misfits decided to ambush me! I was on my sloop, just trying to gather some treasure from a nearby island, when I saw their ship approaching.     At first, I thought it was just another player looking for a friendly chat, but as they got closer, I realized they were ready for a fight! I quickly raised my sails and tried to escape, but they were relentless.     I managed to fire a few cannonballs back at them, but they were dodging like pros. I even tried to board their ship to take the fight to them, but they had a few sneaky traps set up.     In the end, I had to make a hasty retreat, but not before they managed to sink my ship and steal my loot! Has anyone else had a run-in with Kiwibeard? Any tips on how to deal with his crew? I need to get my revenge!
__label__1 I know this might sound a bit odd, but I’m really struggling with my relationship with the scale. I’ve been trying to lose weight and get healthier, but I find myself obsessing over the number it shows. It’s affecting my mental health and self-esteem, and I feel like I need to take a break from it.     I’ve thought about ways to sabotage the scale so that I can stop weighing myself and focus on healthier habits instead. I’m not looking to harm the scale or anything drastic, but maybe cover it up or hide it?     Has anyone else felt this way? What are some healthy ways to distance myself from the scale without feeling guilty? I want to focus on how I feel and my overall health rather than just a number. Any advice would be appreciated!

__label__0 For context, I live in the UK and am a university student. I come from a left-leaning background: my mother and her friends are self-described feminists, as is my girlfriend.     Even though I agree with the tenants of feminism (wanting the equality of women to men, understanding the reality of the negative effects of the patriarchy), I have never labelled myself as a feminist. There’s a few reasons I think I have for this.    Largely, I find myself uncomfortable with any ideological self-labelling. I am unsure why, but doing it feels somewhat worrisome. In a similar way, I believe in many Marxist tenants, but again I wouldn’t self-describe as Marxist.    More specifically, though I understand the importance of men to be openly supportive of the feminist cause, the concept of a “male feminist” seems intrinsically icky, as opposed to a “man who holds feminist beliefs”. Once again, I struggle to articulate why I hold this view.    There are also parts of radical feminism, for example the trans-exclusionary and misandrist veins, which I disagree with, so I feel uncomfortable aligning myself with a movement which also contains these beliefs. Furthermore, the latter radfem group would likely be against my self-labelling as feminist anyway.    You may have recognised from this post, that I generally struggle to articulate why exactly I cannot call myself “a feminist”. Because of this, I am unsure if I lack the tools to defend this position, or if I am simply fallacious and need to reconcile my beliefs. Either way, I am going back to stay with my mum this week, and I’m sure this conversation will come up at dinner. Usually she brings it up and I say the same half-baked arguments which just upsets her. So I would like to either explain myself better, or just call myself a feminist (which I won’t do unless I actually believe it).    Cheers.
__label__0 EDIT: omg you all are incredible. So much amazing advice, I haven’t had the time to reply to everyone yet!! I am so excited to get more into this world!!!    I want to get into sewing because I would like to make more of my own clothes (I currently knit but I can’t just have a whole wardrobe full of knitted clothes).    But when I look at homemade clothes a lot of them look oddly… bulky? Boxy? Stiff? Just not very flowy. I can’t tell if it’s the type of fabric people are using or just the nature of home sewn clothing. Or maybe I’m just seeing a lot of beginner projects and getting more intricate fit/drape is a more advanced skill? What types of skills should I look to build on my sewing journey to get more flowy clothing? Does anybody know any good, flowy patterns that I could aspire to work towards?

__label__1 I've been trying to make my taskbar invisible in Windows 10 for a cleaner desktop experience, but I'm not sure how to go about it. I know there's an option to auto-hide the taskbar, but I want it completely invisible unless I hover over the area where it usually is.     I've tried the following steps:  1. Right-click on the taskbar and select "Taskbar settings."  2. Turn on "Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode."    However, it still shows a slight shadow or outline when I hover over it. Is there a way to make it completely disappear?     Also, if anyone has any tips on customizing the desktop further or using third-party software to achieve a more minimalistic look, I would love to hear those suggestions too! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I was nervous about this as I’ve been told scrubs aren’t great for broken skin etc, but so far, this is fine. I’ve used it twice so far and as well as softening my skin I find it really helps to smooth it too. It reduced those teeny tiny little bumps that are almost invisible unless up close. It’s more of a microdermabrasion so not harsh at all, one of their more gentle scrubs for sure. It’s definitely improved the texture and hasn’t broken me out at all. It’s also improved dry patches where my makeup usually cracks and flakes. Would buy again!

__label__1 I'm currently in college and I've been struggling with my study habits. I find it really hard to focus and retain information, especially when it comes to subjects that I find challenging. I often procrastinate and end up cramming the night before exams, which only adds to my stress and anxiety.     I've tried various methods like using flashcards, summarizing notes, and even studying in groups, but nothing seems to work consistently for me. I also get easily distracted by my phone and social media, which makes it even harder to concentrate.     I really want to improve my study skills and find a routine that works for me.

__label__1 I've been experiencing really slow streaming on my PC lately, and it's becoming quite frustrating. I primarily use services like Netflix and YouTube, but the videos often buffer or play in lower quality, even though my internet connection seems fine.     Here are some details about my setup:  - **Internet Speed**: I have a 100 Mbps connection, and when I run a speed test, I usually get around 90 Mbps.  - **PC Specs**: I have a decent gaming PC with an Intel i5 processor and 16GB of RAM, so I don't think it's a hardware issue.  - **Browser**: I mostly use Chrome, but I've tried Firefox and Edge as well, and the problem persists across all of them.  - **Network**: I'm connected via Ethernet, and I’ve tried restarting my router and modem multiple times.    I also checked for any background applications that might be using bandwidth, and I didn’t find anything unusual.     Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to improve my streaming performance? Could it be a setting in my PC or something related to my network? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I have a really hard decision to make, should I taper Zoloft after I'm done with my Klonopin taper? Or taper it at the same time? It might be a terrible idea to suspend Zoloft (I'm on 25 mg) while I'm tapering K, it might create more havoc in the overall biochemistry of my brain, the reason I want to get off of Zoloft is because of the sexual side effects, the emotional blunting and I'm very concerned (extremely concerned) about the possibility of developing PSSD after discontinuation, i just want to be off these god-awful drugs and then there is getting off of Trazodone later which I'm not so worried about but I want to be psych meds free! That's the deepest conviction i have right now despite my drug-battered brain, my ongoing taper, my depression...
__label__1 1440p gaming has been a hot topic in the gaming community lately, and for good reason! As someone who recently upgraded from 1080p to 1440p, I can confidently say that it has been a game changer for my overall gaming experience.    First off, the visual clarity at 1440p is noticeably better. Textures are sharper, and the details in environments are much more pronounced. This is especially true in open-world games where you can appreciate the vastness and intricacies of the landscapes. Games like "Cyberpunk 2077" and "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" look absolutely stunning at this resolution.    Another significant advantage is the increased screen real estate. With a higher resolution, I can have multiple windows open while gaming or streaming without feeling cramped. This is a huge plus for multitaskers or those who enjoy streaming their gameplay.    Performance-wise, 1440p can be demanding, but with the right hardware, it can be a sweet spot between 1080p and 4K. Many modern GPUs handle 1440p quite well, allowing for high frame rates without sacrificing too much graphical fidelity. This is particularly important for competitive gamers who rely on smooth gameplay.    However, it’s worth noting that not everyone may find 1440p necessary. If you’re primarily playing fast-paced competitive games, 1080p might still be the way to go for the highest frame rates. But for those who enjoy immersive single-player experiences or visually stunning titles, 1440p is definitely worth considering.    In conclusion, 1440p is indeed a big game changer for many gamers. It strikes a balance between performance and visual fidelity that enhances the overall gaming experience. What are your thoughts? Have you made the switch to 1440p, and if so, how has it changed your gaming experience?

__label__0 I'am wondering, i saw many posts here talking about mental health today.    Is that due to the fact that we somehow went to a point we understand that this f\*ckg war is not going to end soon and at that point it will most probably escalate even more, we start to realise we probably  might be the next ones being drafted to die for the profit of greedy politicians.     Honestly why they dont go fight and settle this bs themselves? The draft should be made worldwide illegal and all men should refuse to fight and contribute to this madness.
__label__1 I recently had a situation with my rental property in California that I could use some advice on. I rented out a 3-bedroom unit to a family of four, but shortly after they moved in, I discovered that they had added three additional people to the household without my knowledge or consent.     Initially, I was understanding and gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they were just having family visit. However, it quickly became clear that these additional occupants were not just temporary guests. I noticed that the utilities were spiking, and I received complaints from neighbors about noise and overcrowding.     I checked the lease agreement, and it clearly states that the maximum occupancy is based on the number of bedrooms, which means they are exceeding the limit. I reached out to the tenants to discuss the situation, and they claimed that they needed extra help with expenses and that the additional people were just staying temporarily.     I’m torn on how to handle this. On one hand, I want to be fair and understanding, but on the other hand, I need to enforce the lease terms to protect my property and ensure it’s not being misused.     What steps should I take next? Should I issue a formal notice to comply with the lease terms, or is there a way to negotiate a solution that works for both parties? I’m also concerned about the potential for further issues if I don’t address this promptly. Any advice from fellow landlords who have faced similar situations would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I just started my first week at university, and while I was excited about this new chapter in my life, I’m already feeling overwhelmed. My mum has been calling me every day, and while I know she means well, she keeps bringing up how she’s worried that nobody likes me or that I’m not making friends.     It’s really starting to get to me. I’ve met a few people in my classes, and we’ve had some good conversations, but I haven’t formed any deep connections yet. I feel like I’m still trying to find my footing and adjust to this new environment.     Every time I talk to my mum, she asks if I’ve made any friends and when I tell her I’m still getting to know people, she seems disappointed. It makes me feel like I’m failing somehow. I know she just wants me to be happy and have a good experience, but her comments are making me feel more anxious and self-conscious.     I’m trying to remind myself that it’s only the first week and that it takes time to build friendships, but her worries are weighing heavily on me. I’m starting to doubt myself and wonder if I’m coming off as unlikable or if I’m doing something wrong.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you deal with family pressure while trying to navigate new social situations? Any advice would be appreciated.
__label__1 I've been experiencing some frustrating network issues with my Starlink service lately, and I wanted to see if anyone else has had similar problems or if there are any solutions out there.    For the past week, I've noticed frequent drops in connection, especially during peak evening hours. My setup is in a rural area, and while I understand that congestion can be an issue, it seems to be happening more often than usual. I’ve tried rebooting the dish and the router multiple times, but the connection still drops intermittently.    I also checked the Starlink app, and it shows that my dish is properly aligned and has a clear view of the sky. However, the latency has been higher than normal, and speeds have fluctuated significantly. I went from getting around 100 Mbps down to as low as 10 Mbps at times.    Has anyone else been experiencing similar issues? Are there any tips or tricks to stabilize the connection? I’m considering reaching out to Starlink support, but I wanted to see if the community had any insights first. Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been experimenting with overnight subliminals for a while now, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences. Initially, I was skeptical about whether they could be as effective as listening during the day. However, I've found that they can indeed work just as well, if not better, for some people.    When I first started using overnight subs, I made sure to choose ones that resonated with my goals. I set my playlist to loop while I slept, and I noticed some interesting changes in my mindset and behavior over time. For instance, I was using a subliminal for confidence and self-esteem, and I woke up feeling more positive and motivated than usual.     I think the key is to ensure that you are in a relaxed state before sleeping, as this can help your subconscious absorb the messages more effectively. I also recommend keeping a journal to track any changes or progress you notice after using overnight subs.     Has anyone else had success with overnight subliminals? What are your experiences? Do you think they work just as well as daytime listening?

__label__1 I've been trying to figure out the best way to utilize both the integrated GPU (iGPU) and my discrete GPU on my ASUS laptop. I know that the iGPU is great for power-saving tasks and light gaming, while the discrete GPU can handle more demanding applications and games.     My main question is how to effectively switch between the two. Is there a way to set specific applications to run on the discrete GPU while keeping the iGPU for everything else? I've heard about using the NVIDIA Control Panel for this, but I'm not entirely sure how to set it up correctly.     Also, are there any performance benefits or drawbacks to using both GPUs in tandem? I want to make sure I'm getting the best performance without sacrificing battery life too much. Any tips or experiences you all have would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I like the OWL, but damn, nothing beats the hype I had at the World Championships. It was so unique and cool to cheer for your own country, even if it was pretty weak against big opponents like Korea, USA, Canada and so on. I always liked cheering for the underdogs and it was a great way to showcase talent from all over the world. The last World Championship was pretty lame but for the first 2 years the championships were the reason I started eSports in the first place. I just hope OW2 becomes popular enough to justify a world championship.
__label__0 I've been listening to Isaiah Saldivar recently and he helped me open my eyes about the spiritual realm.    This is indeed spiritual.    I need deliverance. God has delivered me from many evil spirits, but the one that seems stubborn and won't go away is, lust.    And this kind of lust is my lust after my own self and it disgusts me.    Back then as a teenager, I struggled with low self-image. I've always thought I was ugly and unattractive. Then it suddenly flipped. I have bloomed and now, I'm on the opposite side of that spectrum.    People get turned on when they open porn, but it's so difficult to suppress the spirit of lust if I am so easily turned on, just by looking at my face on the mirror.    I remember taking photos of my self, not even naked, and I went on masturbating while looking at my OWN photos.    This has been going on for years and I'm still struggling. I was able to stop doing it for months then I relapsed again.    What do I do?

__label__1 With the recent news about the new author taking over Berserk after Miura's passing, I find myself feeling a mix of skepticism and hope. Miura's unique storytelling and art style have left an indelible mark on the series, and it's hard to imagine anyone else capturing the same essence that made Berserk so special.    I understand that the new author, Kouji Mori, was a close friend of Miura and has been involved in the series for a long time, which gives me some reassurance. However, I can't help but wonder if he can truly honor Miura's vision while also bringing his own flair to the story. The themes of struggle, sacrifice, and the human condition are so deeply woven into the fabric of Berserk that any misstep could potentially alienate long-time fans.    What do you all think? Are you optimistic about the continuation of the story, or do you share my concerns? How do you feel about the direction the series might take under new leadership? Let's discuss!

__label__1 I just visited a Super Target for the first time in years, and wow, I forgot how amazing it is! The layout is so spacious and organized, making it easy to find everything I needed. I was blown away by the variety of products they have, from groceries to home decor.     I ended up spending way more time than I planned because I kept discovering new sections. The grocery area was impressive, and I loved the fresh produce selection. I even found some seasonal items that I didn’t expect to see!     Also, can we talk about the Starbucks inside?

__label__0 I have a piece of property that has a right away to it . They built a house right beside the right of way at the beginning where it connects to the main road . The renters of the house keep blocking the right away . I have talked to him and I've also talked to the landowner and she assured me that it would be taken care of, but it has not.        She has tried to get me to sell the land and also tried to get me to use another way to get to my property that would require a 4 wheel drive I explained to her that I do not have a 4 wheel drive.       I do not live there, it just has a barn and a cabin on the property with power(My dad built everything there).        I tried to go over last Saturday and again it was blocked. Neither the Renter or the landowner were home which was probably a good thing. I was so mad.        I don't know what the next step would be. I would prefer to not involve lawyers. She is a very wealthy lady and I am not.      This is in Virginia. Any information would be greatly appreciated !
__label__0  I have a few ACInfinity AirTap units. They are pretty basic devices to boost airflow out of HVAC registers.

__label__1 What if creepy bugs could talk and whisper and crept around your house while you slept, just like we do when we sneak around for a midnight snack? Imagine a spider doing its own version of Mission Impossible, slowly and creepily maneuvering down from the ceiling, its little legs making barely a sound. It could whisper things like, "Don't move, I'm just here for a snack too..." or "You won't even notice me until it's too late." Suddenly, your peaceful sleep turns into a suspenseful thriller, where every rustle and tickle could be a tiny, plotting creature ready to invade your dreams. It's a whole new level of paranoia when the bugs aren't just crawling, but also scheming.
__label__1 Hello r/stocks community!     As a beginner looking to dive into the world of stock investing, it can be overwhelming with all the information out there. I wanted to share some tips and tutorials that have helped me and might help you on your journey to becoming a successful investor.    ### 1. **Educate Yourself**       - **Books:** Start with some foundational books like "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham and "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel. These provide great insights into investing principles and market behavior.     - **Online Courses:** Websites like Coursera and Udemy offer courses on stock market investing. Look for beginner courses that cover the basics of stock analysis, portfolio management, and market trends.     - **YouTube Channels:** Channels like "Graham Stephan" and "The Financial Diet" provide valuable content on personal finance and investing strategies.    ### 2. **Understand the Basics**       - **Stock Market Terminology:** Familiarize yourself with key terms like stocks, bonds, ETFs, dividends, market capitalization, and P/E ratios. Knowing the lingo will help you understand discussions and analyses.     - **Types of Investments:** Learn the difference between stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Each has its own risk and return profile.    ### 3. **Start Small**       - **Practice with a Demo Account:** Many brokerage platforms offer demo accounts where you can practice trading with virtual money. This is a great way to learn without risking real capital.     - **Invest Small Amounts:** Once you feel comfortable, start investing small amounts in stocks or ETFs. This will help you get a feel for the market without significant risk.    ### 4. **Develop a Strategy**       - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term:** Decide if you want to be a long-term investor (buy and hold) or a short-term trader (buy and sell frequently). Each strategy requires different approaches and mindsets.     - **Diversification:** Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your portfolio across different sectors can help mitigate risk.    ### 5. **Stay Informed**       - **Follow Market News:** Websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance provide up-to-date news on market trends and economic indicators.     - **Join Online Communities:** Engage with communities like r/stocks, where you can ask questions, share insights, and learn from experienced investors.    ### 6. **Be Patient and Disciplined**       - **Avoid Emotional Trading:** The stock market can be volatile. Stick to your strategy and avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed.     - **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your portfolio and investment strategy.

DBD has a bug that show you price in ARS but then they charge you the price in USD. Other games works. I can't guarantee your game will change your price to ARS on the micro-pays
__label__1 I'm planning a big move from Spain to the US and I'm a bit overwhelmed with how to handle my bulky belongings. I have a few large items like furniture, a bicycle, and some appliances that I want to take with me, but I'm not sure about the best way to ship them overseas.    Here are a few questions I have:  1. **Shipping Options**: What are the best shipping options for bulky items? I've heard about sea freight and air freight, but I'm not sure which one is more cost-effective for larger items.  2. **Cost Estimates**: How much should I expect to pay for shipping bulky items? Any ballpark figures would be helpful, especially for a full container versus shared shipping.  3. **Customs and Duties**: What should I know about customs regulations when bringing my belongings into the US? Are there specific duties or taxes I should be aware of?  4. **Insurance**: Is it worth getting insurance for my belongings during transit? What kind of coverage should I look for?  5. **Packing Tips**: Any tips on how to pack bulky items to ensure they arrive safely?     I want to make this transition as smooth as possible, so any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 So I just got absolutely wrecked in the market today. I thought I was being clever, buying into a "sure thing" stock that everyone was hyping up. You know the one – the one that’s supposed to be the next big thing, the one that’s going to the moon. Well, I bought in at the peak, thinking I was a genius, and now I’m sitting here watching my investment plummet faster than my hopes and dreams.    I mean, how do I keep falling for this? I should know better by now. I’ve seen the memes, I’ve read the warnings, but here I am, staring at my screen like a deer in headlights, watching my portfolio bleed red.     To make matters worse, I decided to double down because I thought it was a dip worth buying. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. Now I’m just sitting here, contemplating my life choices and wondering if I should just go full YOLO and buy some options to try and recover my losses.     Anyone else feel like they’ve been absolutely f***ed by the market today? What’s your worst trading mistake? Let’s commiserate together.

__label__1 I've been on Zoloft (sertraline) for about 6 weeks now, starting at 50mg and recently increasing to 100mg. At first, I felt a bit of relief from my anxiety and depression, but lately, I've been experiencing some really strange side effects that have me questioning if this is normal.     For the past week, I've been feeling really jittery and restless, almost like I have too much energy but can't focus on anything. My sleep has been disrupted too; I wake up multiple times during the night and have trouble falling back asleep. On top of that, I've noticed that my appetite has decreased significantly, and I often feel nauseous after eating.     I also had a couple of days where I felt really emotional and cried over things that normally wouldn't bother me. It’s like I’m on a rollercoaster of emotions, and I’m not sure if this is just part of the adjustment period or if something is wrong.     I reached out to my doctor, and they said it’s common to experience fluctuations in mood and side effects when adjusting to a new medication, but I can’t help but feel anxious about it.     Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms while on Zoloft? I just want to know if I should be concerned or if this is something that might settle down with time.
__label__1 Vaccines, including the seasonal flu vaccine, often use inactivated viruses to stimulate an immune response without causing disease. The process of inactivating a virus typically involves several steps:    1. **Virus Cultivation**: The first step is to grow the virus in a controlled laboratory environment, usually in chicken eggs or cell cultures. This allows for the production of a sufficient quantity of the virus needed for the vaccine.    2. **Inactivation**: Once the virus is harvested, it must be inactivated to ensure it cannot cause illness. This can be achieved through various methods:     - **Chemical Inactivation**: One common method is to treat the virus with chemical agents such as formaldehyde or beta-propiolactone. These chemicals modify the viral proteins, rendering the virus non-infectious while preserving its structure enough to elicit an immune response.     - **Heat Inactivation**: Another method involves exposing the virus to heat. This can denature the proteins and disrupt the viral structure, effectively killing the virus.     - **Radiation**: Some vaccines may use radiation (like ultraviolet light) to inactivate the virus by damaging its genetic material.    3. **Purification**: After inactivation, the vaccine undergoes purification to remove any residual chemicals, cellular debris, or unprocessed viral particles. This step is crucial to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.    4. **Formulation**: The inactivated virus is then formulated into a vaccine, often combined with adjuvants (substances that enhance the immune response) and stabilizers to ensure the vaccine remains effective during storage.    5. **Testing**: Before being approved for public use, the vaccine undergoes rigorous testing for safety and efficacy through clinical trials.    The inactivated virus in the vaccine is recognized by the immune system, which then produces antibodies and trains immune cells to respond to future infections by the live virus. This process helps protect individuals from the flu without the risk of causing the disease itself.

__label__1 I'm gearing up for my next Jump Chain and I'm looking for some suggestions on which worlds to explore. I've already done a few jumps in the past, including some from the Naruto and One Piece universes, but I'm feeling a bit stuck on what to tackle next.     Here are a few ideas I've been considering:  1. **Dark Souls** - I love the lore and the challenge, but I'm worried about the difficulty. Any tips on how to survive in that world?  2. **My Hero Academia** - Superpowers and heroics sound fun, but I want to know if the jumps are balanced and what kind of perks are available.  3. **Overlord** - The idea of being a powerful overlord in a fantasy world is appealing, but I’m curious about how the power scaling works and if it’s easy to get overwhelmed.  4. **Attack on Titan** - The setting is intense, and I’m intrigued by the Titans, but I’m not sure how to approach the jump without getting eaten.    If you have any other worlds you think would be fun or interesting to jump into, or if you have any advice on the ones I mentioned, I’d love to hear it! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 Context, I decided to participate in a school supplies thing where you fill a backpack for a child who needs stuff for school.    Here I was this morning shopping for school supplies for a kiddo and then I came across Parker fountain pens. I stopped picked one up put it in my cart then stopped and thought, gee I have no clue how old the kid will be who will receive this and man what if this targets them for bullying or someone steals it from them? I slowly put it back on the shelf. I wish I could give it to them but there are so many unknowns. Maybe next year.  I also wanna get them an agenda type thing. Ah well. Anyone have any ideas on doing this in a way that doesn't target the kid nor give the family the financial burden of like buying ink for this one pen? Looking for ideas for next year.

__label__1 I recently found myself deep in a thread discussing the best enemies-to-lovers romance novels, and I have to say, I spent way too much time reading through everyone's recommendations and personal stories!     It started innocently enough when I was looking for a new book to dive into, but then I got sucked into the comments. People were sharing their favorite tropes, and I found myself nodding along as they described the tension and chemistry that comes from characters who can’t stand each other at first.     I ended up reading about so many books I hadn’t heard of before, like "The Hating Game" and "Red, White & Royal Blue," and I even added a few to my TBR list. I loved how passionate everyone was about their favorite couples and the hilarious anecdotes they shared about their reading experiences.     By the time I looked up, I had spent over two hours just scrolling and commenting! It was such a fun rabbit hole to fall into, and I came away with a ton of new titles to explore.     Has anyone else had a similar experience? What threads have you found yourself getting lost in?

__label__0 This episode should have been about Liberty still coping with the death of JT or at least her being the one to team up with Emma about Lakehurst. Instead, this was a Manny/Emma story. It seemed out of place for Emma to care so much about what happened to JT. And it didn't even seem like it was totally about the death of JT but that it was a Lakehurst student. Another excuse for a protest. Emma and JT haven't really talked since season four. Liberty should have been the center of the episode instead of her being in the sidelines yelling "Go home Lakehurst!"
__label__1 I just had a hilarious moment while playing Mafia: The Game that I had to share! So, I was in the middle of a mission where I had to take out a rival gang member. I thought I was being all stealthy, sneaking around the gas station, but I accidentally bumped into a gas pump and set off the alarm!     Suddenly, all the NPCs started freaking out, and I had to scramble to take cover while the cops showed up. It turned into a full-blown shootout right in the middle of the gas station! I ended up taking out the target, but not without causing a massive scene.     Has anyone else had a similar experience where a simple mission turned into chaos? What’s your funniest or most unexpected moment in the game? Let’s hear your stories!
__label__1 I've been learning Spanish for a few months now, and I've noticed that consistency is key. I usually try to study for about 30 to 60 minutes each day. This seems to be the sweet spot for me where I can absorb new vocabulary and grammar without feeling overwhelmed.     If I study for too long, I find that I start to lose focus and retention drops significantly. On days when I can’t dedicate that much time, I still try to do at least 10-15 minutes of practice, whether it’s through apps, flashcards, or listening to music in Spanish.     I’ve also found that reviewing what I learned the previous day helps reinforce my memory. How about you all? How long do you study each day, and what methods do you find most effective to retain what you learn?

__label__1 I wanted to share my experience with finding the right training style for my reactive dog, and hopefully, it can help others who are in a similar situation.     My dog, a 3-year-old Australian Shepherd named Max, has always been a bit skittish around new people and other dogs. When we first adopted him, we tried a few different training methods, but nothing seemed to resonate with him. He would often shut down during training sessions or become more anxious, which was really disheartening for both of us.    After doing some research and talking to a few trainers, I realized that I needed to tailor the training approach to Max's specific needs. I found a trainer who specializes in positive reinforcement and fear-based reactivity, which was a game changer. Instead of traditional obedience training, we focused on building Max's confidence and teaching him that he could trust me to keep him safe.    We started with basic commands in a low-distraction environment, rewarding him with treats and praise for any small progress. Gradually, we introduced him to controlled situations with other dogs and people, always ensuring he felt comfortable and safe. If he showed signs of stress, we would take a step back and give him space, which helped him learn that he could express his feelings without being forced into uncomfortable situations.    One of the most effective techniques we used was desensitization. We would expose Max to triggers at a distance where he felt safe, rewarding him for calm behavior. Over time, we decreased the distance, allowing him to approach at his own pace. This method not only helped him with his reactivity but also strengthened our bond as he learned to trust my guidance.    I also learned the importance of managing his environment. I started using a front-clip harness and a muzzle when we went out, which gave me more control and helped prevent any potential incidents. It was a tough decision at first, but it made outings much less stressful for both of us.    Now, Max is much more relaxed and confident. He still has his moments, but we’ve made significant progress. I’ve learned that every dog is different, and what works for one may not work for another. It’s all about being patient, observant, and willing to adapt your training style to meet your dog’s unique needs.     If anyone else is struggling with a reactive dog, I encourage you to explore different training methods and find what works best for your furry friend. It’s a journey, but it’s so rewarding to see them thrive!
__label__1 I recently installed a free-standing tub in my bathroom, and I'm looking for advice on how to properly insulate it to maintain the water temperature. I've heard that some people use foam board insulation underneath the tub, while others suggest using a reflective insulation material.     My tub is made of acrylic, and I want to ensure that it stays warm during baths, especially in the colder months.     1. What type of insulation do you recommend for under a free-standing tub?   2. Should I insulate the sides of the tub as well, or is that unnecessary?   3. Are there any specific products or techniques that have worked well for you?     Any tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
__label__1 The Hood Safari missions in GTA: San Andreas are some of the most memorable and entertaining parts of the game, and they really showcase the unique culture and vibe of Los Santos. Personally, I think the mission where you take a group of gang members on a tour of the neighborhoods is the most canon. It really captures the essence of the gang life and the dynamics between the different factions in the game.    As for my favorite, I have to go with the one where you end up in a shootout with rival gang members while trying to show off your turf. The adrenaline rush of driving through the streets, dodging bullets, and trying to keep your crew alive is just classic GTA. Plus, the banter between the characters adds a lot of humor to the chaos.     What about you guys? Which Hood Safari getaway do you think fits best into the overall story of San Andreas, and which one do you enjoy the most?

__label__1 I know this might not be a popular opinion, but I genuinely believe that cowgirl is the best sex position. Hear me out: it offers so much versatility and intimacy. First off, it allows for a great deal of control for the person on top, which can lead to a more pleasurable experience. You can adjust the angle, depth, and pace to what feels best for you, and that’s a huge plus.    Additionally, it creates a unique opportunity for eye contact and connection, which can enhance the emotional aspect of sex. The person on top can lean forward for kisses or to whisper sweet nothings, making it feel more intimate. Plus, it’s a great way to switch things up and keep the excitement alive in the bedroom.    I also think it’s underrated in terms of physical fitness. It can be quite a workout, and it’s empowering to take charge in that way. So while some might prefer the more traditional positions, I stand by my belief that cowgirl reigns supreme. It’s time to give it the recognition it deserves!

__label__0 *Shahmaran* (شاهماران)— a being that is a half woman and half serpent in veneer, however, in esse, is said to be the manifestation of sins of a particular locality— is seen at nighttime singing demonic lullabies by the townsmen and outlanders alike.     A particular vagabond, who was supposed to visit the town in order to treat a townsman who after being overexposed to the moonlight developed an ontological anomaly that resulted in the inversion of his physical body and the shadow, decided not to enter the town when he on the outskirts of the town saw *Shahmaran* signing demonic lullabies.     *“I had previously heard of Shahmaran, however, last night I was met with the displeasure of seeing this grotesque entity in a corporeal form. Shahmaran’s torso was composed of scales that resembled that of snakes and had a hierarchical texture with hexagonal macro-patterns aligned on the ventral surface of the skin. Though afar, I could see her visibly, and bewilderingly the sound of the lullabies that she was singing appeared to be originating much closer from where she was actually located corporeally. I, without having second thoughts decided to return and inform the Department of Mythological Sightings.*     The locals have reported that though most of the lullabies are incomprehensible as the language used by her is the same that was used by the serpent to lure Adam in Eden which now has become extinct. However, it has been reported by the senior townsmen that the lullabies always begin with *“blanch me in an earthen dish, give my extract to the vizier, and feed my flesh to the sultan.”*     The sages have stated that appearance of *Shahmaran* is a pernicious omen because this entity is seen when a locality is steeped in sin and unwilling to repent. The bourne of *Shahmaran* is to beguile the demonic spirits through singing lullabies, though lullabies are sung to put younglings to sleep, however, since the demonic realm is inverted, lullabies are used to ensorcell demons in order to rouse then from their slumber.     Once the demons have roused, they will gradually supplant the shadows of sin-laden men with themselves. Once the shadows have been supplanted, then the demons will eventually usurp the essence of these sin-laden men and when this has been achieved, the sin-laden men will be made to descend towards an inferior state of being and will be left to mourn and anguish the loss of their existence in the nether world.  
__label__0 I'm not sure if I have ocd as I haven't seeked professional help yet, but I'm certain that this behaviour is related to it. This started recently. My hobby is building computers and last time I did it I accidentally scratched a part and ever since then nothing has been the same. This drove me crazy to the point where I had to sell it. Since that happened, it's been so influential that I think it has transitioned to affecting many other things in life, it started with things that matter to me, keeping them intact, even normal wear and tear on them would piss me off. And its expanding to everything else. Whenever I have to do literally ANYTHING, I'm just unable to relax. I'm always under the pressure of doing it wrong. This has been getting worse and worse as the days go by, like as I'm typing this nonsense, I'm wondering if I'm even using my phone correctly. I'm unable to enjoy life because thoughts like these. I feel like I'm mentally detoriating, I have a feeling that soon I will be unable to live normally anymore. Someone please guide me out of this
__label__0 I am just discovering subtasks excited about this feature.  I have already started using them on my iPhone and iPad.  However, I use [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) to access my reminders through Chrome browser on a Windows  system.  I am trying to figure out how to add subtasks on there.  I tried dragging and dropping and that didn't work.  I noticed that you can create new reminders but hitting enter.  This also works for subtasks that I have created on the iPhone but how do I create a subtask otherwise?
__label__0 So I don’t know how to politely tell him (especially since he takes any form of criticism badly and negatively) that he has this weird thing that he does. Every conversation started by anyone he manages to redirect towards him. So example I start talking about a dream I had and he interrupts me and starts talking about his dream. That sort of thing. But the worst thing is that he repeats this stories over and over again. I don’t know if he doesn’t remember telling them or if he doesn’t care. And he does it with just about any situation, he’ll rudely interrupt the person and just babble about his story (that we know already).  We have dated for 4 years, he’s 33 and I’m 30. I am not sure if I should just keep this to myself or what is a nice way of saying this bothers me? We have been together for a while and I feel like it shouldn’t be a big issue to bring up but like I said he doesn’t take anything well.
__label__0 Just dipping my toe into this sub, tired of trying to run the app and getting stonewalled  with lvl 1-10 legendary/mythic requests lol. Just lemme know
__label__0 So I was getting upset about something trivial and my BF told me to stop being “weak”. This really hurt me and he said “sorry”. Then he went to bed. I sent him a lot of short text messages explaining how much it hurt and why it hurt. I don’t want him to think I’m overreacting or being melodramatic.
__label__1 I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. I (28f) have been dating my boyfriend (30m) for about a year now. Things started off really well, and we had a lot of fun together. However, over the past few months, I’ve noticed some changes in his behavior that have me feeling confused and concerned.    At first, he was very attentive and communicative, but lately, he seems distant. He often cancels plans at the last minute, and when we do spend time together, he’s often distracted by his phone or seems preoccupied. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he brushes it off, saying he’s just been busy with work and life in general.     I understand that life can get hectic, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off. I’ve also noticed that he’s been spending more time with his friends and less time with me, which makes me feel unimportant. I’ve brought this up a couple of times, and he reassures me that he cares about me, but his actions don’t seem to match his words.    I’m at a point where I’m not sure if I should confront him again about how I’m feeling or if I should just give him space. I don’t want to come off as needy or pushy, but I also don’t want to ignore my feelings.     What should I do in this situation? Should I have another conversation with him, or should I wait and see if things improve on their own? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I'm looking for a subreddit where I can share and discuss eerie, abstract videos that don't necessarily have a clear meaning but evoke a strange feeling or atmosphere. I love those kinds of clips that leave you questioning what you just watched, and I think it would be great to find a community that appreciates that kind of content. If anyone knows of a subreddit that fits this description, please let me know!
__label__1 I was thinking about how much fun it would be to see Danny review the movie "The Room." It's such a cult classic with its infamous bad acting, nonsensical plot, and memorable quotes. I can just imagine Danny's commentary on Tommy Wiseau's performance and the bizarre love triangle. Plus, the movie has so many cringe-worthy moments that I think Danny would have a blast tearing it apart while also appreciating its unintentional humor. What do you all think? Any other suggestions for movies that would be great for Danny to review?
__label__0 Earlier tonight, we heard some yelling just outside our house and my wife started screaming that someone was in our garden. My kids all started freaking out. I ran outside with a baseball bat ready to bash someone’s head in. That’s when I saw two tweaker-looking dudes standing outside the fence saying they just chased someone into our yard. They said he stole from them and he was running away. A few seconds later, the guy that was in our yard hopped back over and ran away. They left after him. It all happened so fast that I just wasn’t able to react better and didn’t see the guy in the garden, but heard him.     How can I keep this from happening again? Not only did this freak me and my wife out, it scared the absolute shit out of my children. We have a standard 6ft tall wooden fence. Is it legal to put barbed wire atop it? Any way to make a fence non-scalable? Any recommendations?     Note: we did call the police, but since those guys had already left, the police did not show up and just told us to call 911 if we see them. So no help there.
__label__0 I used to do a lot of dance as a kid. Modern, tap, ballet, street, you name it. I remember that part of the reason I gave it up was because I didn’t like the way the leotard made my body look.    I’ve been thinking about dance a lot lately. I miss it. I miss the shows, the costumes, quiet lessons by the barre and pushing myself harder then I ever have.    As the title says, I’m pre-T. I have short hair and sometimes I feel like I pass, but I’m short and my body doesn’t pass. My voice is pretty androgynous but it goes high if I don’t control it. I don’t know how I would deal with the dysphoria of being in a leotard and probably being the only boy in the class.     I’m thinking of rejoining my old dance school, which was Christian. I don’t know if they would be inclusive.    What do I do?
__label__1 Recovering from an eating disorder (ED) is a journey that often continues long after the initial treatment phase. One of the most important aspects of this journey is developing a healthy relationship with food and nutrition. Here are some insights and tips for maintaining healthy eating habits years after ED recovery:    1. **Listen to Your Body**: After recovery, it’s crucial to reconnect with your body’s hunger and fullness cues. This means eating when you’re hungry and stopping when you’re satisfied, rather than adhering to strict meal plans or calorie counts.    2. **Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods**: Incorporate a variety of whole foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods not only nourish your body but also help you feel more energized and satisfied.    3. **Practice Mindful Eating**: Mindful eating involves paying attention to the experience of eating—savoring each bite, appreciating the flavors, and being present during meals. This practice can help you enjoy food more and reduce anxiety around eating.    4. **Avoid Labels**: Try to steer clear of labeling foods as "good" or "bad." This can create a negative mindset around certain foods and lead to feelings of guilt or shame. Instead, view food as a source of nourishment and enjoyment.    5. **Seek Support**: Even years after recovery, it can be beneficial to have a support system in place. This could be friends, family, or a therapist who understands your journey and can provide encouragement and accountability.    6. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember that it’s okay to have days where you don’t eat perfectly or feel off about food. Recovery is not linear, and it’s important to practice self-compassion and forgive yourself for any slip-ups.    7. **Stay Educated**: Continue to learn about nutrition and healthy eating. Understanding how different foods affect your body can empower you to make choices that align with your health goals.    8. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge how far you’ve come in your recovery journey. Celebrate the small victories, whether it’s trying a new food, cooking a healthy meal, or simply feeling more at peace with your eating habits.    In conclusion, healthy eating after ED recovery is about balance, mindfulness, and self-compassion. It’s a lifelong journey of learning to nourish your body and mind in a way that feels good for you.

__label__1 Hey everyone!      I’m relatively new to the gym and have recently started a push/pull/legs routine. I’ve been doing it for about a month now, and I’m looking for some advice to make sure I’m on the right track. Here’s what my routine looks like:    **Push Day:**    - Bench Press: 3x8-10    - Overhead Dumbbell Press: 3x8-10    - Incline Dumbbell Flyes: 3x10-12    - Tricep Dips: 3x8-10    - Lateral Raises: 3x12-15      **Pull Day:**    - Pull-Ups (or Lat Pulldowns): 3x6-8    - Bent Over Barbell Rows: 3x8-10    - Seated Cable Rows: 3x10-12    - Face Pulls: 3x12-15    - Bicep Curls: 3x10-12      **Leg Day:**    - Squats: 3x8-10    - Deadlifts: 3x6-8    - Leg Press: 3x10-12    - Lunges: 3x10-12 (each leg)    - Calf Raises: 3x12-15      I’m currently training 6 days a week, alternating between these three workouts. I’m focusing on form and trying to progressively overload each week.      Here are a few questions I have:    1. Is this routine balanced enough for a beginner?    2. Should I be incorporating any additional exercises or variations?    3. How do I know when to increase weights?    4. Any tips on recovery and nutrition for someone just starting out?      Thanks in advance for your help! I’m excited to hear your thoughts and any suggestions you might have!
__label__1 I've been on Lexapro for about a year now, and while it helped with my anxiety, I've been experiencing some side effects that I just can't seem to shake off. My doctor suggested switching to Zoloft, and I'm a bit nervous about the transition.     For those of you who have made the switch, how did it go for you? Did you experience any withdrawal symptoms from Lexapro? How long did it take for Zoloft to kick in? I’ve heard that some people feel better on Zoloft, while others have had a rough time.     Any tips on managing the switch or what to expect would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__0 I've been NC with my BPD father for 6+ years. He was an alcoholic and delusional and 0 to 60 in no time. I hate how much he still impacts my life even though he's gone. I can't handle a conversation about conflict with my boyfriend without being so afraid he will leave or react just like my father did. I panic at loud noises. I have the most wonderful boyfriend who swears he isn't going anywhere. But how do I know that in my darkest moments? I break down every time and feel like everything is my fault. No matter what the conversation is about. I hesitate to bring things up because I'm scared of how it will go. When I do bring it up, I'm terrified the whole time. And break down crying because he says he still loves me.    I hate my father for making me this way. I'm in therapy and have been working on this for years and it slowly gets better but it's really fucking hard. I have low self esteem and feel like I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I know that isn't true, just how I feel in the moment.    I just needed to vent to someone that understands. Thank you.
__label__1 I currently work in a role that I enjoy, but I’ve been offered a new position that is essentially the same job with a different company, and it comes with a significantly higher salary. I’m torn about whether to make the switch. On one hand, the pay increase would greatly improve my financial situation and allow me to save more for future goals. On the other hand, I value the relationships I’ve built at my current job and the company culture, which I find very supportive.    I’m also concerned about the potential risks of moving to a new company. What if the new environment isn’t as positive? What if I don’t enjoy the work as much? I’ve heard mixed reviews about the new company’s management and work-life balance.    I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced a similar decision. How did you weigh the pros and cons? What factors did you consider most important when deciding whether to switch jobs for a higher salary? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I think it would be amazing to have John Mayer on the Joe Rogan Experience! Not only is he an incredible musician with a unique style, but he also has some fascinating insights on creativity, mental health, and the music industry.     Mayer has been open about his struggles with anxiety and how it affects his songwriting process, which could lead to some deep conversations about the pressures artists face. Plus, his experiences with different genres and collaborations could spark interesting discussions about the evolution of music and the creative process.     I can just imagine Joe and John diving into topics like the importance of vulnerability in art, the impact of social media on musicians, and even some of the philosophical aspects of life that come through in his lyrics.     What do you all think? Would you like to see John Mayer on the podcast? What topics would you want Joe to discuss with him?
__label__1 I've been playing Cities: Skylines for a while now, and I've hit a major snag with my city's finances. I started off strong, but now I'm in the red and struggling to keep my city afloat. My population is growing, but so are my expenses.     I've tried raising taxes, but that just seems to make my citizens unhappy and leads to more abandoning. I've also cut back on services like police and fire departments, but that just leads to crime and fires, which makes things worse.     I’m currently at a point where I’m considering taking out loans, but I’m worried that will just lead to more debt in the long run.     Does anyone have tips on how to stabilize my economy? What are some effective strategies to increase income without driving my citizens away? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I know that some online pharmacies offer it, but I want to make sure I'm getting a legitimate product.

__label__1 Gear Parabolic is a new token that has just hit the market and I believe it has incredible potential to moon! With a unique approach to decentralized finance, Gear Parabolic aims to revolutionize the way we think about yield farming and liquidity provision.    What sets Gear Parabolic apart is its innovative parabolic rewards system, which incentivizes long-term holding and active participation in the ecosystem. The tokenomics are designed to ensure that early adopters and loyal holders are rewarded handsomely as the project gains traction.    Currently, the supply is limited, which creates a scarcity effect that could drive the price up significantly as demand increases. The team behind Gear Parabolic is experienced and has a solid roadmap that includes partnerships with other DeFi projects and plans for cross-chain compatibility.    Moreover, the community is growing rapidly, with active discussions on social media and a strong presence on platforms like Telegram and Discord. This grassroots support is crucial for the success of any crypto project.    If you're looking for a potential moonshot, I highly recommend checking out Gear Parabolic. It’s still early days, and getting in now could lead to substantial gains as the project develops. Remember to do your own research and invest wisely!

Is there a way to take a screenshot of the entire city or create a map view that shows all the districts and roads clearly? Any tips on the best settings or tools to use would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 my grandpa is sick in hospital and worried if it’s going to weigh down my boyfriend please    my boyfriend was rushed to hospital yesterday. i’m home but my boyfriend is in college. my boyfriend has a close relationship with my grandparents since he was 10. I told him last night thr news about my grandpa because we discussed before he left for school if something ever happened to them if he was away from school. I feel bad for being sad when my boyfriend asks me how I am doing. because i’m very positive person. I don’t want it to weigh on him because I know he is really sad about the situation as well just because of how long he knew him for. my boyfriend texted me saying he was concerned for me. i’m okay mentally, i’m worried but I don’t know any information or anything. I sometimes handle the situation in different away, i’m very sensitive person but I act strong infront of others so they don’t see my emotions. I’m worried if i’m weighing my boyfriend down if i’m not okay. he’s been really supportive and i know he’s just that type of guy who will feed off someone’s else’s emotions because i’m the same. i think it’s really effecting him too. the last thing I want is him to have so much weight on him. i feel bad for even being sad sometimes because we always positive. I just don’t want this to effect his academic life. he been asking me how i feel and tbh I have no idea. I know others when they talk about heavy topics they can’t handle that stress. I just feel bad for bringing it a upon him. I trust him enough to open up but my last relationships end because they couldn’t handle heavy things in my life. how do I get used to having someone there to support me
__label__0  I am a 27 year old guy and I am looking for something really special, I consider myself especially sensitive and emotional.    About me:    * I have been working for a few years as a Java programmer (from home).

__label__1 I've been diving back into Cyberpunk 2077 after a long break, and I wanted to get a sense of how much the game has changed since its launch. I remember the initial release was pretty rough, with tons of bugs and performance issues, especially on last-gen consoles.     Since then, there have been several major patches and updates that have really transformed the experience. Here are some of the key changes I've noticed:    1. **Performance Improvements**: The game runs much smoother now, especially on consoles. The frame rate issues and crashes that plagued the launch have been significantly reduced.     2. **AI Enhancements**: NPC behavior has been improved. They seem to react more realistically to player actions, and the traffic AI is less chaotic than it used to be.     3. **Quest Fixes and Additions**: Many quests that had bugs or were unfinishable at launch have been fixed. Additionally, new side quests and content have been added, enriching the overall narrative experience.     4. **Visual Upgrades**: The graphics have seen some tweaks, with better lighting and textures in certain areas. Night City feels more alive and immersive than before.    5. **Gameplay Mechanics**: There have been adjustments to combat mechanics, including weapon balancing and the introduction of new skills and perks that make character builds more diverse and interesting.    6. **User Interface Improvements**: The UI has been refined, making it easier to navigate menus and manage inventory.     7. **New Features**: The addition of features like the ability to change your appearance at any time and the introduction of new vehicles and weapons have added more depth to the gameplay.    Overall, it feels like CD Projekt Red has really committed to improving the game and addressing player feedback. I’m curious to hear from others about their experiences since the updates. What changes have you noticed, and do you think the game has finally reached its potential?
__label__1 Jane Foster has often been seen as an underwhelming character in the Marvel comics and films, but with the right approach, she can be transformed into an incredible and compelling figure. Here are some thoughts on how to elevate her character:    1. **Deepen Her Backstory**: One of the key ways to make Jane Foster more interesting is to explore her past in greater detail. Delve into her motivations, her struggles, and her triumphs. Highlight her journey as a strong, independent woman who has faced adversity, whether it be in her personal life or her career as a doctor.    2. **Showcase Her Intelligence and Skills**: Jane is a brilliant astrophysicist, and this aspect of her character should be emphasized. By showcasing her scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills, she can stand on her own as a hero, rather than just being defined by her relationship with Thor. Let her use her intellect to contribute to the team and save the day.    3. **Empower Her as Thor**: In the comics, Jane takes on the mantle of Thor, and this transformation is a powerful way to elevate her character. By giving her the power of Thor, not only does she gain physical strength, but she also faces the challenges and responsibilities that come with it. This arc can be explored in a way that highlights her growth and resilience.    4. **Create Strong Relationships**: Develop her relationships with other characters in the MCU. Whether it’s her friendship with Thor, her mentorship with younger heroes, or her rivalry with other scientists, these dynamics can add depth to her character. Show how she interacts with others and how those relationships shape her.    5. **Address Real-World Issues**: Jane Foster's character can be a platform to address real-world issues such as healthcare, gender equality, and the struggles of being a woman in a male-dominated field. By weaving these themes into her story, she becomes more relatable and relevant to audiences.    6. **Give Her Agency**: Ensure that Jane Foster is not just a supporting character but has her own agency and story arcs. She should make her own decisions, face her own challenges, and have her own victories. This will help audiences see her as a fully realized character rather than just a sidekick.    7. **Visual Representation**: In terms of design, giving Jane a unique and striking look as Thor can help her stand out. A costume that reflects her personality and strength can make her more memorable and iconic.    By focusing on these aspects, Jane Foster can be transformed from an underwhelming character into a powerful and inspiring figure in the Marvel universe. What do you all think? How would you like to see Jane Foster's character evolve in future projects?

__label__1 I've been on the hunt for some quality clothing in ODG (Operational Detachment Green) patterns, specifically the Lupus and Ursus designs. I love the unique look and functionality these patterns offer for tactical gear.     I've checked out a few online retailers, but I wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations for where to buy these styles, especially if there are any brands that specialize in tactical clothing with these patterns.     So far, I've found some options on websites like Tactical Distributors and 5.11 Tactical, but I'm curious if there are any lesser-known brands or shops that offer good quality gear in these patterns.     Also, if anyone has experience with the fit and durability of these patterns, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about how Pokémon has evolved over the years, and I’m curious about everyone’s favorite Pokémon from each generation!     Here’s my list:    **Generation 1:** Charizard - It was my first favorite and still holds a special place in my heart.     **Generation 2:** Umbreon - I love its sleek design and the fact that it’s a dark type!     **Generation 3:** Gardevoir - Such a beautiful Pokémon with a great design and strong abilities.     **Generation 4:** Lucario - The aura abilities and its cool factor make it a standout for me.     **Generation 5:** Zoroark - I love its trickster nature and the design is just awesome.     **Generation 6:** Greninja - The Ash-Greninja form is just too cool, plus it’s a ninja frog!     **Generation 7:** Lycanroc (Midnight Form) - I love the wolf aesthetic and its battle style.     **Generation 8:** Dragapult - A dragon that can shoot its own children? How cool is that?!     Now it’s your turn! What are your favorites from each generation? Let’s see how our lists compare!

__label__1 Hey everyone,    I’ve been experiencing some strange noises on my bike, but they only seem to appear during longer rides, typically after about 20-30 minutes of continuous riding. At first, I thought it might just be the usual creaks and groans that come with riding, but this is different.     The noise sounds like a combination of a light clicking and a faint grinding, and it seems to be coming from the bottom bracket area or possibly the rear hub. I’ve checked the chain and cassette for wear, and they seem fine. I also made sure everything is properly lubricated.     Here are a few details about my setup:  - Bike: 2018 Trek Domane AL 2  - Components: Shimano Tiagra groupset  - Recent maintenance: I recently replaced the chain and cleaned the drivetrain thoroughly.    I’ve tried to replicate the noise while stationary, but it only happens when I’m riding, especially when I’m putting more power into the pedals, like climbing or sprinting.     Has anyone else experienced something similar? Could it be a sign of a loose bottom bracket or something in the rear hub? I’d appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to diagnose this issue. Thanks in advance!

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I just wanted to share that Lamannia Preview 3 for the Isle of Dread is now live! I’ve had a chance to dive in and explore some of the new content, and I’m really excited about what I’ve seen so far. The new quests and areas are looking fantastic, and the atmosphere really captures that classic D&D feel.     One of the highlights for me has been the new monsters and the unique mechanics they bring to the table. It’s refreshing to see some new challenges that require different strategies to overcome. I also love the art design; the environments are vibrant and immersive, making it easy to get lost in the adventure.     For those who haven’t had a chance to check it out yet, I highly recommend logging in and giving it a go. It’s a great opportunity to provide feedback and help shape the final release.     What are your thoughts on the new content? Have you found any hidden gems or encountered any particularly tough challenges? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I've been diving into affiliate marketing as a side hustle for the past three months, and I wanted to share my journey so far, along with some insights and plans moving forward.    Since my last update, I've focused on building my niche website around outdoor gear and adventure travel. Here’s what I’ve accomplished:    1. **Content Creation**: I’ve published eight blog posts, each targeting specific keywords related to outdoor activities and gear reviews. I’ve been using SEO tools to help optimize my content, and I’m starting to see some organic traffic trickle in. The goal is to create valuable content that resonates with my audience and encourages them to click on affiliate links.    2. **Social Media Engagement**: I’ve set up Instagram and Pinterest accounts to promote my content. I’ve been posting regularly and engaging with followers, which has helped me build a small but growing community. I’ve also joined a few Facebook groups related to outdoor activities to share my posts and connect with like-minded individuals.    3. **Email List Building**: I’ve started an email newsletter to keep my audience updated on new posts and exclusive content. I’m using a lead magnet (a free eBook on outdoor tips) to encourage sign-ups. So far, I have about 50 subscribers, which is a small start, but I’m optimistic about growing this list.    4. **Affiliate Partnerships**: I’ve signed up for several affiliate programs, including Amazon Associates and a few niche-specific programs. I’ve started to see some clicks on my affiliate links, but no sales yet. I’m learning that it takes time to build trust with my audience before they start making purchases through my links.    5. **Analytics and Adjustments**: I’ve been tracking my website traffic and social media engagement using Google Analytics and social media insights. This data is helping me understand what content resonates best with my audience, allowing me to adjust my strategy accordingly.    **Plans for Next Month**:  - Increase my content output to at least two blog posts per week.  - Experiment with paid ads on social media to drive traffic to my website.  - Continue to grow my email list and engage with subscribers through valuable content.  - Explore additional affiliate programs to diversify my income sources.  - Start creating video content for YouTube to complement my blog posts and reach a wider audience.    I’m excited about the progress I’ve made so far, but I know there’s a long road ahead. If anyone has tips or experiences to share about affiliate marketing, I’d love to hear them! Thanks for following along on my journey!

__label__1 I've been diving into Far Cry 5 on Infamous difficulty, and let me tell you, it's a whole different beast! Here are some tips that have helped me survive and thrive in this challenging mode:    1. **Stealth is Key**: On Infamous difficulty, enemies are much more alert and can take you down quickly. Use stealth to your advantage. Crouch, use silenced weapons, and take out enemies one by one to avoid drawing attention.    2. **Upgrade Wisely**: Focus on upgrading your health and resistance first. The more health you have, the longer you can survive in firefights. Also, consider perks that enhance your stealth and crafting abilities.    3. **Use the Environment**: Take advantage of the terrain. Use high ground for sniping, and always be aware of your surroundings. You can use bushes and trees to hide from enemies and plan your next move.    4. **Crafting and Resources**: Make sure to gather resources and craft items whenever possible. Molotovs, grenades, and health kits can turn the tide in tough situations. Always keep your inventory stocked.    5. **Choose Your Fights**: Not every encounter is worth engaging in. If you find yourself outnumbered or outgunned, it might be better to sneak past or retreat to fight another day.    6. **Utilize Companions**: Don’t forget about your allies! They can provide valuable support in combat. Choose companions that complement your playstyle, whether you prefer stealth or all-out assault.    7. **Plan Your Loadout**: Before heading into a mission, think about your loadout. A mix of long-range and close-quarters weapons can be beneficial. Also, consider bringing a vehicle for quick escapes if things go south.    8. **Save Often**: Make use of the manual save feature. If you’re about to enter a tough area, save your game first. This way, if you die, you won’t lose too much progress.    9. **Learn Enemy Patterns**: Take some time to observe enemy patrols and behaviors. Knowing when to strike and when to hide can make a huge difference.    10. **Stay Calm**: It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but staying calm and thinking strategically will help you make better decisions in the heat of battle.    I hope these tips help you tackle Infamous difficulty! What strategies have you found effective? Let’s share our experiences!
__label__0 Anyone has experience with it? Can you please share? Applied in 2019, 2 interviews and no decision, RFE or anything else.

__label__1 I recently made the switch from an iPhone 11 to a Pixel 6, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying the experience so far! The camera quality is absolutely stunning, especially in low light conditions. I've been experimenting with the Night Sight feature, and the results are impressive.    The customization options on Android are a breath of fresh air compared to iOS. I love being able to tweak my home screen and use widgets to display information at a glance. The Material You design is also a nice touch, making everything feel cohesive and personalized.    One thing I did notice is that the battery life seems to be a bit different. I’m still getting used to how the Pixel manages battery optimization compared to the iPhone. I’d love to hear any tips from fellow Pixel users on how to maximize battery life or any settings I should adjust.    Overall, I’m really happy with my decision to switch. If anyone has any recommendations for apps or features I should check out, please let me know!
__label__1 I just watched the new Elvis movie and I have to say, I really enjoyed it! However, I think I might have spotted a plot hole and wanted to see if anyone else noticed it or if I’m just overthinking things.    In the film, there’s a scene where Elvis is shown performing in Las Vegas, and it seems to imply that he was the first major act to perform there. But I remember learning that there were other performers and shows happening in Vegas before Elvis made it big.     Is it possible that the movie took some creative liberties with the timeline or the significance of Elvis's performances? I’m curious if anyone else caught this or if there’s an explanation that I might have missed.     Thanks for any insights!

__label__1 Teleportation is the ultimate form of convenience, but it would also completely change our understanding of distance and time. Imagine if you could instantly be anywhere in the world—would we still value travel? Would we still have a sense of adventure, or would it just become a mundane task? And what about the impact on relationships? Would we take for granted the ability to see loved ones at a moment's notice, or would it diminish the significance of those moments? It's fascinating to think about how something that seems so futuristic could alter our daily lives and perceptions.
__label__1 I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and started taking medication (Adderall) about a month ago. Initially, I felt a significant improvement in my focus and productivity, which was a huge relief. However, I've started to notice that my anxiety levels have increased quite a bit since I began the medication.     I’ve always had some level of anxiety, but it feels like the Adderall has amplified it. I find myself feeling jittery, restless, and sometimes even overwhelmed by small tasks that I used to handle without much thought.     I’ve tried to manage it by practicing mindfulness and deep breathing exercises, but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this side effect. Did you find that your anxiety improved over time, or did you have to adjust your medication?     I’m also curious if anyone has had success with other ADHD medications that might not have the same impact on anxiety. I really want to make this work, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m constantly on edge. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 I'm on mobile, my mind is a mess and I'm non-native english speaker, so sorry for inconvenience.    Me (24f) and hubby (27m) need to move away and cut conact completely with my parents.  Our current living situation isn't bad as we are renting apartment my parents bought for the time I'm attending Uni (I'm finishing in a month) and in theory we could rent as long as we need. But the place is a mess! We keep it clean on daily basis but my parents refuse to even allow us to make necessary renovations like getting mold out of walls and floors (the really nasty black mold). Reason being - they want my father to come on weekends (mind you 500km one way) to renovate it all just because they want to make it their way (even though my hubs used to work on the construction site). Hence nothing has been done for the past 4 years we live here. I understand, it's their apartment, they bought it, but it's not about looks, it's just unsanitary now!    We always dreamed of having a house. After wedding last year and unfortunate deaths of closesest family members (hubs dad (58m) and my grandma (68f) both this year), we were given founds (wedding gifts, and after deaths insurance money) that made possible for us to buy a land. We started papers in early april, and now are finishing details makig us land owners in less than 3 weeks from now.  Around month ago we decided to share it with my hubby's family BIL (31m) SIL (30f) and MIL (58f) keeping my side of family completely in the dark... I wanted to tell my lil bro (17m) or my grandpa (69m) and share that joy with them, but it would mean my parents (51m &amp; 47f) would find out. They supported me and bro financially (afterwards guilt tripping about it), but I rarely felt genuine love, as they treated both me and my bro as puppets to show their friends. Telling them would cause many problems as some of their behaviors from the past are:  -  writing fraudulent contracts in my (then 22yo) name defrauding money at their company and causing me problems  - tying to manage money from our wedding gifts  - ruining our wedding time to the extent of me and hubs trying to escape right after ceremony and skipping actual wedding  - mentally and sometimes physically abusing both me and my bro to the extent of us running away couple times (police never involved)  - blamed me for sexual abuse I recived at 13 from classmates, told me it was result of my inability to make friends with them and they invited my abuser to "hang out" at my childhood home    Anytime I visit an hour later I end up in tears in my childhood bedroom due to insults and shouting mostly from my mother. I know they are toxic and I need to cut them out completely, but first things first I wanna be able to do it safely, and having a land which I won't tell them about seems to be good step, but I can't help feeling like AH for not telling my family. Even though my parents are how they are I am scared what will happen when they find out I hid this from them and plan to cut them out completely...
__label__1 I have a set of MBUS Pro Offset sights and a Seeall Open Sight MK2 with a picatinny mount for sale. The MBUS Pro Offset sights are in excellent condition and have been lightly used. They provide a great backup option for your primary optic and are perfect for quick target acquisition.    The Seeall Open Sight MK2 features a tritium crosshair, making it easy to use in low-light conditions. It's a fantastic sight for those who prefer a more traditional sighting system but want the benefits of modern technology.    I'm looking to sell both items together for $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Local pickup in North Carolina is preferred, but I can ship at the buyer's expense. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions!
__label__1 The term "Splinternet" refers to the fragmentation of the internet into various national or regional networks, often due to government regulations, censorship, and differing policies on data privacy and security. In the context of Cyberpunk, it’s a fascinating concept that aligns perfectly with the game’s themes of corporate control, surveillance, and the struggle for freedom in a digital age.    In the world of Cyberpunk 2077, we see echoes of the Splinternet through the various factions and corporations that control information and access to the net. The idea that different regions or groups might have their own versions of the internet, heavily monitored and controlled, raises questions about the nature of freedom and connectivity in a dystopian future.    Imagine a scenario where the Netrunners have to navigate through these fragmented networks, each with its own set of rules and dangers. It could lead to some intense gameplay mechanics where players must adapt their strategies based on the specific network they are infiltrating.     What do you all think? How would you envision the Splinternet affecting the lore and gameplay in Cyberpunk? Have you encountered any elements in the game that hint at this concept?

__label__0 Grandma died yesterday. She had a 9 year old chihuahua/Pomeranian mix that has basically never left her side. She stayed in the bed with her the entire time she was on hospice and didn't really want to leave the bed even after the body had been removed. She was a shakey mess until I got her home and snuggling with my daughter in bed.    My 6 year old Daughter and dog are getting along wonderfully last night/today and she's always had a great temperament aside from wanting to be a lap guard dog sometimes but the situation isn't exactly perfect.    I've never messed with small dogs and we have a couple things to get through. I do want this dog, it's just that I've never had to mess with one very much before.    1: she's terrified of the two year old rambunctious Airedale-Poodle (who, to his credit, is being the sweetest most obedient dog he's ever been in his life while this scared girl snarls at him from atop the couch.) For now he's doing a bit more yard time than normal and getting extra walks.    2: We are a two working adult household and while we are both out of work for Hurricane Laura reasons we will have to leave this dog alone eventually and I'm worried about the separation anxiety. I'm hoping that her and her hopefully soon-to-be-large-friend are enough company but what else can we do to help her with this transition?  His work-day setup is an air-conditioned dog house (it's a big shed)  and lots of yard toys and it works for him. For her we were thinking of baby-gating off an area by the dog door that came with the house (it's her size) and maybe even baby-gating an outside area for her to bask and potty. The key thing for us in the short term is that she's not peeing on the carpeted areas. She can go through a dog door to get inside, but doesn't use one to go out at the moment.    3: She's got odd potty training in that she knows outside=potty but doesn't know inside =/= potty. The good news here is that she doesn't seem to go when she's on furniture, which is where she prefers to be. I guess I'm willing to make an exception to the no-furniture rule for her.    4: How do I walk this thing? Is it supposed to go on walks? I got her a tiny harness but she just kind of freezes up whenever I try to put either that or just a leash on. I know she hasn't been going on walks up to this point.    5. She vibrates a lot. I was reading that this is scared. Is there confidence building stuff I should be doing? I do recognize this is a pretty big transition she's going through so maybe that is part/most of it.    5: Is there any tiny dog stuff I need to know that I haven't even noticed yet? I don't even know what I don't know.    I've tried googling some of this stuff and know how I train the big pup, but am hoping for some good fast advice from y'all while we are ironing this new and unexpected situation out. Thanks for reading through the ramble, trying to line out everything myself still.
__label__1 Imagine if every president had their internet search history archived for public viewing. It would not only provide insight into their decision-making processes but also reveal their personal interests, concerns, and the information they sought out during their time in office.     On one hand, it could promote transparency and accountability, showing the public what resources and information influenced their policies. On the other hand, it raises questions about privacy and the potential for misinterpretation of innocent searches.     But in a world where we demand accountability from our leaders, perhaps knowing what they were curious about or worried about could help us understand their actions better. It’s a strange thought that the most powerful people in the world might have their most mundane online queries scrutinized by the public.
__label__1 I've been seeing this amazing person for a few months now, and I genuinely like them. We have so much fun together, and I can really see a future with them. But here's the thing: I'm absolutely terrified to have the "what are we" talk.     Every time I think about it, my stomach drops. I know we need to define what we are, but I'm scared of ruining what we have. What if they don't feel the same way? What if they want something casual and I'm looking for something more serious?     I keep replaying our conversations in my head, trying to find clues about how they feel, but I can't read their mind. I don't want to come off as clingy or desperate, but I also don't want to waste my time if we're not on the same page.     I know I need to be brave and just ask, but the fear of rejection is paralyzing. I keep telling myself that clarity is better than uncertainty, but the thought of potentially losing them is so daunting.     Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you handle it? I could really use some advice or just some reassurance that I'm not alone in feeling this way.

__label__1 I’ve been struggling with something that I feel I need to share. Sometimes, when I get upset or triggered by someone, I find myself having this overwhelming compulsion to lash out or be an asshole to them. It’s like a switch flips in my brain, and I can’t help but respond with anger or sarcasm, even if I know it’s not the right thing to do.    I grew up in an environment where conflict was handled with aggression and hurtful words, so I guess it’s not surprising that I sometimes revert to those patterns. But I hate it. I hate that I can’t control my reactions, and I hate that I might hurt someone else because of my own pain.     After these moments, I often feel a wave of guilt and shame wash over me. I know that the people I lash out at don’t deserve it, and I worry that I’m just perpetuating the cycle of hurt that I experienced as a child. I want to break free from this behavior, but it feels so ingrained in me.     Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with the urge to react negatively when you’re triggered? I want to learn healthier ways to express my feelings without resorting to being hurtful. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

__label__0 The only time in his career he’s had consistent QB play was in 2019 with Ryan Fitzpatrick ( who only started 13 games that year ). In that year he had 72 receptions, 1200 yards and 9 touchdowns. At 29 years old, he is the clear cut #1 receiver for the Patriots. He will be absolutely peppered with targets, especially in the red zone. Remember, their #2 receiver, Jakobi Meyers only has 2 TD’s in his 46 game career so they will rely a lot on Parker in the red zone. He could easily amass 10-13 receiving touchdowns with all the volume he’ll see this year.

__label__1 I’ve been seeing my therapist for a while now, and I’ve been opening up about my struggles with focus, organization, and impulsivity. I really believe I have ADHD, but I get the feeling that my therapist isn’t convinced.     During our sessions, I’ve mentioned things like how I often forget appointments, lose track of time, and have a hard time completing tasks. Instead of validating my concerns, my therapist often suggests that I might just be stressed or overwhelmed. I appreciate their perspective, but it feels like they’re not fully understanding the depth of my experiences.     I’ve done some research on ADHD and even took a few online assessments that pointed towards it. I’ve also talked to friends who have ADHD, and they relate to my experiences.     Has anyone else felt this way with their therapist? How did you approach the conversation? I want to advocate for myself and get the help I need, but I’m not sure how to bring it up without sounding like I’m pushing a diagnosis. Any advice would be appreciated!

I’ve always loved brisket but wanted to find a more budget-friendly option that still delivers on flavor and tenderness. Here’s how it went down!    I picked up a nice tri-tip from my local butcher for about $30, which is a steal compared to brisket prices these days. I started by trimming some of the excess fat, but I left a good amount on to keep it juicy during the cook.     For the rub, I went with a simple mix of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a touch of smoked paprika for that extra kick. I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors meld before firing up the smoker.    I set my smoker to 225°F and used a mix of oak and hickory wood for a nice, balanced smoke flavor. I placed the tri-tip on the smoker and let it go for about 2.5 hours, until it hit an internal temperature of around 135°F. I pulled it off and wrapped it in butcher paper to rest for about 30 minutes.    The result? A beautifully smoked tri-tip with a fantastic bark and a juicy, tender interior. The smoke ring was impressive, and the flavor was out of this world! I sliced it against the grain and served it with some homemade BBQ sauce and grilled veggies.    Overall, this was an easy, cheap, and delicious alternative to brisket that I’ll definitely be making again. If you haven’t tried smoking a tri-tip like a brisket, I highly recommend it! Here are a couple of pics from the cook:    ![Tri-tip on the smoker](https://example.com/tri-tip-smoker.jpg)  ![Sliced tri-tip ready to serve](https://example.com/sliced-tri-tip.jpg)     Happy smoking, everyone!
__label__1 Ivy Dickens is such an interesting character in the Gossip Girl universe! I mean, she came in with a bang pretending to be Charlie Rhodes, and her storyline was filled with so many twists and turns.     I love how she was able to manipulate the Upper East Side elite while also trying to find her own identity. It’s fascinating to see how she navigated the complexities of her relationships, especially with Rufus and Lily.     But let’s be real, her fashion sense was on point! She brought a fresh vibe to the show, and her style was a mix of bohemian chic and classic Upper East Side glam.     What do you all think? Was Ivy a worthy addition to the cast, or did she just complicate things too much? And how do you feel about her ultimate fate in the series? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 It's frustrating to see how the government continues to prioritize the interests of the wealthy while neglecting the needs of the working class. We all know that the rich are getting richer, but what about the rest of us who are struggling to make ends meet?     Every day, I see people working multiple jobs just to pay rent, buy groceries, and keep the lights on. Meanwhile, the government has the resources to provide support, whether it's through better wages, affordable healthcare, or even just a basic safety net. But instead, they choose to turn a blind eye, allowing corporations to exploit workers and keep profits soaring.    It's not just about the rich; it's about the systemic issues that keep us in this cycle of poverty and stress. We need to hold our leaders accountable and demand that they start prioritizing the needs of the people over the profits of the few. We deserve better than this, and it's time for a change.     Let's keep pushing for policies that support workers, fair wages, and a more equitable society. The government can help us out, but they need to hear our voices and feel the pressure to act. Together, we can make a difference.
__label__1 I was really looking forward to the Legend Solo Battles this year, but I noticed they seem to be missing from the game. I remember last year they were a great way to earn some extra coins and collectibles, plus it was fun to test my skills against some of the best legends in the game.     Has anyone heard why they decided to remove them? I thought they were a fan favorite and added a lot of value to the Ultimate Team experience.     I’ve been grinding through the regular Solo Battles, but it just doesn’t feel the same without the legends. I really hope they bring them back in some form, maybe as a limited-time event or something. What do you all think? Are you missing the Legend Solo Battles as much as I am?
__label__1 A while back, I made a post discussing my experiences with Muslim men and the dynamics I observed within the community. Since then, I've had time to reflect on my journey as an ex-Muslim and how my views have evolved.     Initially, I felt a lot of anger and resentment towards the men I encountered, particularly regarding the expectations placed on women and the often toxic masculinity that seemed prevalent. I was frustrated by the way many men justified their behavior through religious texts, using them as shields against accountability.     However, as I distanced myself from the faith, I began to see things from a broader perspective. I realized that many of these men were also trapped in a system that dictated their behavior and beliefs. They were raised in an environment that taught them to view women as lesser, and while that doesn't excuse their actions, it does provide context.     I've come to understand that the issues I faced were not solely about individual men but rather about a culture that perpetuates these harmful ideologies. This realization has allowed me to approach my past with a bit more compassion, even if I still hold firm to my beliefs about the need for change.     Now, as I navigate life outside of Islam, I find myself advocating for healthier relationships and mutual respect between genders. I believe that by sharing our stories and experiences, we can help dismantle the harmful narratives that have been ingrained in us.     I’m curious to hear from others who have had similar experiences. How have your views on gender dynamics changed since leaving Islam? What steps do you think we can take to foster healthier relationships in our communities?
__label__1 I’ve been thinking a lot about scars lately, both physical and emotional. I see people who have been through so much, and they wear their scars like badges of honor. It’s like they’ve fought battles and come out on the other side, even if they’re still struggling.     I find myself envious of those scars. I want to have something to show for my pain, something that says I’ve survived. But instead, I feel like I’m just floating through life, dealing with my depression in silence. I don’t have the visible marks that tell a story, and sometimes I wonder if that makes my struggles less valid.     I know that scars can be a reminder of hurt, but they can also symbolize healing and resilience. I want to feel that strength, to know that I’ve faced my demons and come out stronger. But right now, I feel lost and overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to turn my pain into something that feels meaningful.     Does anyone else feel this way? Do you ever wish you had those visible reminders of your journey? How do you cope with the feeling of wanting to have a story to tell, but feeling like you’re still stuck in the middle of it?
__label__1 I've been trying to figure out how many TikTok accounts I can manage on a single device before TikTok flags them as business accounts. I know that TikTok has certain algorithms and policies in place to prevent spam and misuse, but I'm not sure where the line is drawn.     I currently have a couple of personal accounts and I'm considering starting a new one for a side project. I want to avoid any issues with TikTok thinking I'm running a business account or getting my accounts flagged.     Does anyone have experience with this? How many accounts can you have on one device without triggering any restrictions? Any tips on managing multiple accounts effectively would also be appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I wanted to share my experience with a challenge I set for myself: posting 2 videos every day for 60 days. It’s been quite the journey, and I’ve learned a lot along the way that I think could help others in the community.    First off, consistency is key. Committing to a schedule has not only helped me stay organized but has also kept my audience engaged. I’ve noticed that my views and subscriber count have steadily increased, which is super motivating!    Here are a few tips I picked up during this challenge:  1. **Plan Ahead**: I started by brainstorming content ideas and creating a content calendar. This helped me avoid last-minute stress and ensured I always had something ready to go.  2. **Batch Filming**: On days when I had more free time, I filmed multiple videos at once. This saved me a lot of time during the week and allowed me to focus on editing and promotion.  3. **Engage with Your Audience**: I made it a point to respond to comments and ask for feedback. This not only helped me improve my content but also built a community around my channel.  4. **Don’t Be Afraid to Experiment**: I tried different formats and styles to see what resonated with my audience. Some videos performed better than others, but it was all part of the learning process.  5. **Take Breaks**: It’s easy to burn out when you’re pushing out content every day. I made sure to schedule in some downtime to recharge and come back with fresh ideas.    Overall, this challenge has been incredibly rewarding, and I encourage anyone looking to grow their channel to consider setting a similar goal. It’s tough, but the growth and experience are worth it!     I’d love to hear if anyone else has tried something similar or if you have any tips to share. Let’s support each other on this journey!

Also, if it does regrow, what can I do to encourage healthy growth and blooms? Any tips on care or maintenance would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Extraterrestrial life is often considered a conspiracy theory for several reasons. First, there is a significant lack of concrete evidence that definitively proves the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth. While there have been numerous claims of UFO sightings and encounters, many of these have been debunked or remain unverified, leading skeptics to categorize them as conspiracy theories rather than scientific facts.    Second, the idea of extraterrestrial life often intersects with government secrecy and cover-ups. Many conspiracy theories suggest that governments, particularly the U.S. government, are hiding information about alien encounters or technology. This secrecy fuels speculation and distrust, leading people to believe that there is more to the story than what is publicly known.    Additionally, the portrayal of aliens in popular culture—movies, TV shows, and books—often sensationalizes the concept, making it seem more like fiction than a scientific possibility. This can contribute to the perception that discussions about extraterrestrial life are more about entertainment or conspiracy than legitimate scientific inquiry.    Finally, the scientific community is cautious about claims of extraterrestrial life. While there are ongoing efforts to search for signs of life on other planets (like Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn), the scientific method requires rigorous evidence and peer review, which can take time. This cautious approach can be misinterpreted by some as a dismissal of the possibility of extraterrestrial life, further fueling conspiracy theories.    In summary, the combination of a lack of definitive evidence, government secrecy, cultural portrayals, and scientific caution contributes to the perception of extraterrestrial life as a conspiracy theory.
__label__1 I recently came across a discussion about license plates and how often they might be mismatched with the wrong vehicle. It got me wondering: what percentage of license plates currently on the road are actually on the wrong car?     I understand that there are various reasons this could happen, such as stolen plates, clerical errors during registration, or even people intentionally swapping plates. However, I couldn't find any concrete statistics on this.     Does anyone have insights or data on how common it is for license plates to be mismatched with their vehicles? Any studies or reports on this topic would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 A little over 2 years ago I purchased a Samsung fridge. It was fairly expensive so I used the Citibank Costco credit card due to the +24 month warranty extension. I did the whole concierge Costco install and things were good, but now it’s leaking a little water around the ice dispenser.     My question is since it’s out of the Costco/Samsung warranty period what is the process to get it fixed? It looks like I fill out a form on Citibank’s website, but I haven’t proceeded because I don’t know what the steps are. Do I call Samsung to fix it and then get reimbursed? Do they have to pre authorize this? I am planning to call in the morning, but wanted some feedback on what to expect. I’m hoping this is easy and I don’t get the run around.    Thanks!
__label__1 I’m feeling really lost right now. I’ve been married to my husband for several years, and he has struggled with addiction in the past. He was doing so well for a long time, but lately, I’ve noticed some changes in his behavior that are making me really concerned.     He’s been more secretive with his phone, spending a lot of time alone, and I’ve caught him lying about where he’s been. He also seems more irritable and distant, which is not like him at all. I’ve tried talking to him about it, but he brushes it off and says I’m overreacting.     I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but my gut is telling me something isn’t right. I’m scared of what this could mean for our relationship and for him. I love him and want to support him, but I also don’t want to enable any bad behavior.     Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach this without pushing him further away? I just want to help him, but I feel so helpless right now.

__label__1 Hello everyone,    I recently upgraded my internet plan and got an Arris Surfboard SB8200 modem. I want to connect multiple computers and a switch to this modem to ensure that all devices can access the internet simultaneously. However, I'm a bit confused about the best way to set this up.    Currently, I have:  - The Arris SB8200 modem  - A 5-port unmanaged switch  - Two desktop computers and a laptop that I want to connect to the network    Here’s what I’m thinking:  1. Connect the Arris modem to the WAN port of the switch using an Ethernet cable.  2. Connect each of the computers to the switch using additional Ethernet cables.    My questions are:  - Is this the correct way to set it up?   - Will I need to configure anything on the modem or switch for this to work?  - Are there any potential issues I should be aware of with this setup?    I appreciate any advice or tips you can provide! Thanks!
__label__0 Anyone had issues with this? I feed my puppy at 10:30pm (sometimes even closer to midnight) but she still throws up bile in her crate at 6am once or twice a week. We’ve tried Pepcid and no luck. Our vet is at a loss. Just wondering if anyone else has had this issue or a vet with a different solution? Is it possible it’s crate-related anxiety? (She never whines or barks before throwing up, though)
__label__0 I have two iphones with two different phone numbers. I have enabled Text Message forwarding on both phones so any message that is sent to either of my numbers is received on both phones. When messages are sent from people that use iMessage (blue ones), sending and receiving from either phone (to and from either number) works fine as it is supposed to be. However, if I receive a green message (people on Androids), the message is received on both phones, but I can only reply back to them from the phone number it was received at. In other words, if an Android user sends me a message to iPhone A, the message is received on both iPhone A and iPhone B. However, I can only reply back to them from iPhone A. If I try to reply from iPhone B, I get an error message saying that the phone number for iPhone A is not available and it gives me a choice to send it from the number iPhone B is using.    Again, this only happens with "green" message senders. With iMessage senders, everything seems to be processed through the iMessage Apple cloud and so it knows how to handle it. However, when you turn on Text Message Forwarding feature, it claims you can do both send and receive. So something is not right, or Apple is not being clear that this is only supposed to work both ways with "blue" iMessage users and not for "green" message senders.    I do find it strange that Forwarding is only working one way (receive only) for those "green" senders. The description of the feature says "Allow your iPhone text messages to also be sent and received on other devices signed in to your iMessage account." This implies that it should work for both blue and green senders. I also read somewhere that it is supposed to work as long as the devices are near each other, so that implies it must be using Bluetooth to forward messages between devices and the carrier or the internet are not involved. So I fail to see why this would not work for green senders if it uses Bluetooth to communicate between your devices.    To drive the point further, I also have a Macbook Pro where I also have Text Messages forwarded to. I can receive and reply back to those "green" Android senders from the Macbook Pro just fine with no issues. Why doesn't the same exact thing work from the iPhone?    I have turned on and off message forwarding multiple times and rebooted, made sure I am on the latest version of iOS, etc. So I have gone through the whole Apple troubleshooting book on this, and makes no difference. Seems to me this is one of those bugs Apple is not admitting yet.    Is anyone in the same situation where they cannot reply back to "green" senders from a secondary iPhone?

I want to learn how to maintain my kindness without being a doormat.

__label__1 The Half-Life franchise has been a cornerstone of gaming since the original release in 1998, and with the recent resurgence of interest following the release of Half-Life: Alyx, many fans are left wondering what the future holds for this iconic series.     After the cliffhanger ending of Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the narrative has been left hanging for over a decade, and while Alyx provided some closure and expanded the universe, it also raised new questions. Will we finally see the continuation of Gordon Freeman's story? Or will Valve choose to explore new characters and storylines within the same universe?    There are a few possibilities that could shape the future of Half-Life:  1. **Continuation of Gordon's Story**: Many fans are hoping for a Half-Life 3 that picks up where Episode Two left off. With the technology available today, a new installment could offer an immersive experience that surpasses anything we've seen before.  2. **Spin-offs and New Characters**: Valve could take a different approach by introducing new protagonists and storylines, similar to how Alyx focused on a different character. This could allow for fresh narratives while still maintaining the core elements that make Half-Life special.  3. **Expanded Universe**: With the success of Alyx, there’s potential for more VR experiences or even adaptations into other media, such as animated series or comics, which could further explore the lore and characters of the Half-Life universe.  4. **Community Involvement**: Valve has a history of engaging with its community. Perhaps they could open up development to fan contributions or modding, similar to what they did with the original games, allowing the community to help shape the future of the franchise.    Ultimately, the future of Half-Life is uncertain, but the passion of the fanbase remains strong. What are your thoughts? Do you think we’ll see a new mainline game, or do you prefer the idea of exploring new stories within the Half-Life universe? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 Today, I had dreamed that my entire family had been home and it was a Saturday. I dreamt that I had woken up an hour before my alarm, and that my entire family was asleep, when suddenly, we all heard the front doors pin pad being pressed on, before it opened ( we have a digital lock)   The person tried to enter, but because we had a bar on the door, it couldn't open, though they kept trying to break in. My mom was freaking out while telling my siblings to get into their rooms, while my stepdad grabbed his firearm and went downstairs only in his underwear. My brother, who also knew how to use a gun, would follow, while our dog kept barking and panicking. Soon my mother, and my sister followed them downstairs, and I, in that moment, thought ' well, they've got this handled,' and fell to sleep inside my dream. When I fell asleep in my dream, I woke up in real life. In reality, it was Wednesday and my brother was likely leaving for the bus, before returning to use the bathroom.

I value our friendship a lot, and I don't want to make things awkward if she's not interested.     Has anyone here ever proposed a friends with benefits arrangement to a friend? How did you approach the conversation? What should I consider before bringing it up? Any advice on how to navigate this without jeopardizing our friendship would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I was playing Minecraft with Fabric mods (specifically Sodium, Lithium, and Phosphor) when the game suddenly crashed. I was in the middle of exploring a new biome when it happened, and I didn't get a chance to see any error messages before it closed.     I’m running Minecraft version 1.19.2 and I have the latest versions of all my mods installed. I also have a few quality-of-life mods like Just Enough Items and MiniHUD.     I checked the crash report, but I’m not sure how to interpret it. It mentions something about a NullPointerException, but I’m not sure what that means in this context.     Has anyone else experienced crashes like this with Fabric mods? Any tips on how to troubleshoot or fix this issue? I really want to keep playing without interruptions!     Thanks in advance for any help!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I wanted to share some thoughts and experiences regarding tolerance when it comes to rolling on MDMA. I’ve been using MDMA recreationally for a while now, and I’ve noticed some patterns with my tolerance that I think might be helpful for others to consider.    First off, I want to clarify what I mean by tolerance. For those who might not know, tolerance is when your body becomes accustomed to a substance, requiring you to take more of it to achieve the same effects. With MDMA, I’ve found that if I roll too frequently, the euphoric effects start to diminish significantly.     In my experience, I’ve noticed that if I roll more than once every couple of months, I really start to feel the effects less intensely. The first time I rolled, I took about 150mg, and it was an incredible experience. I felt euphoric, connected, and just overall blissful. However, after rolling again just a month later with the same dose, I didn’t feel nearly as much of that magic.     To combat this, I’ve started to implement a longer break between rolls. I’ve read that waiting at least 3 months is ideal to reset your tolerance, and I’ve been trying to stick to that. It’s tough because the urge to roll can be strong, especially when you’re in a party environment or at a festival, but I’ve found that the longer I wait, the more intense and enjoyable the experience is when I finally do roll again.    Another thing I’ve learned is to be mindful of the dosage. I’ve experimented with lower doses, around 100mg, and found that I can still have a great time without needing to take a higher amount. This not only helps with tolerance but also reduces the risk of negative side effects.     I also make sure to take care of my body in between rolls. Staying hydrated, eating well, and getting enough sleep can really help with recovery and make the next experience even better.     I’m curious to hear about your experiences with tolerance. How do you manage it? Do you have any tips or tricks that have worked for you? Let’s share our knowledge and help each other have the best experiences possible!

__label__1 I was flossing my teeth this morning when I suddenly felt something strange. I checked and realized that one of my fillings had completely fallen out! I’m not sure how long it had been loose, but I didn’t feel any pain or discomfort until now.     I’m a bit panicked because I’ve never had a filling fall out before. I know I need to see a dentist as soon as possible, but I’m wondering how urgent this is. Should I be worried about infection or further damage to the tooth?     In the meantime, is there anything I can do to manage the situation? Should I avoid eating on that side of my mouth? I’m also curious about what the dentist might do to fix it.

You can mark off days when you complete your habits, providing a visual representation of your progress.    10. **Accountability Partner**: Sometimes, the best tracker is a person. Find a friend or family member who shares similar goals and check in with each other regularly to discuss your progress.    Experiment with a few of these options to see which one resonates with you the most. The key is to find a method that keeps you motivated and accountable. Happy tracking!

__label__1 I've been playing a lot of Star Wars Battlefront II lately, and I've been focusing on mastering Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker. Here are some tips that I've found helpful for each character:    **Count Dooku:**    1. **Use your abilities wisely:** Dooku's abilities are great for dealing damage and controlling the battlefield. His Lightning Strike can stun enemies, so try to use it when you have multiple opponents in front of you.   2. **Master the dueling mechanic:** Dooku excels in one-on-one duels. Use his lightsaber abilities to outmaneuver your opponent. Remember to block and dodge effectively to avoid taking damage.   3. **Stay mobile:** Dooku is not the tankiest character, so keep moving to avoid getting overwhelmed. Use his speed to your advantage and try to flank enemies.  4. **Utilize the Force:** His Force Choke can be a game-changer in tight situations. Use it to isolate and eliminate key targets quickly.    **Anakin Skywalker:**    1. **Aggressive playstyle:** Anakin is a powerhouse. Don’t be afraid to charge into battle and take on multiple enemies. His abilities allow him to sustain damage while dealing it out.  2. **Use his abilities strategically:** Anakin's abilities can turn the tide of battle. His Charge ability can close the gap quickly, while his Heroic Might can knock back enemies and create space for you to breathe.  3. **Focus on objectives:** Anakin is great for capturing objectives due to his high damage output and survivability. Use him to push forward and secure points.  4. **Watch your health:** While Anakin can take a lot of damage, he can still be taken down quickly if you’re not careful. Keep an eye on your health and retreat if necessary to heal up.    Overall, both characters have unique strengths that can be leveraged in different situations. Practice makes perfect, so keep playing and experimenting with their abilities! What are your favorite strategies when playing as Dooku or Anakin?
__label__1 I've been tasked with managing uBlock Origin (uBO) across multiple ChromeOS devices in our organization, and I'm looking for guidance on how to effectively deploy and manage it at scale.     Here are a few specific areas where I could use some advice:    1. **Deployment**: What are the best practices for deploying uBO across a fleet of ChromeOS devices? Are there any tools or scripts that can help automate the installation and configuration process?    2. **Configuration Management**: Once uBO is installed, how can I ensure that all devices have a consistent configuration? Is there a way to push specific filter lists or settings to all users?    3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Are there any recommended methods for monitoring the effectiveness of uBO across devices? I’d like to track how many ads are being blocked and if there are any issues that users are encountering.    4. **User Education**: What strategies can I use to educate users about uBO and its benefits? I want to make sure they understand how to use it effectively and know how to report any issues.    5. **Troubleshooting**: If users encounter problems with uBO, what are the common issues I should be aware of, and how can I help them resolve these issues quickly?    Any insights, resources, or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 If your immortality is taken away, you were never truly immortal, just unkillable by normal means. It’s like being a character in a video game with invincibility mode turned on; as soon as that mode is switched off, you’re just as vulnerable as everyone else. True immortality would mean existing beyond the reach of any force, not just surviving the usual threats. It’s a fascinating distinction that makes you wonder about the nature of life and death.
__label__1 I just had to share this because I’m still in shock! I just won my first game of Spellbreak, and honestly, it was through sheer dumb luck.     I dropped into the map and started off pretty shaky, missing a few shots and getting chased by a couple of players right off the bat. I managed to escape and find a few potions to heal up, but I was still feeling pretty nervous.     As the game progressed, I found myself in the final circle with only a couple of other players left. I was hiding behind a rock, trying to catch my breath and figure out my next move. I had a Fire Gauntlet in my right hand and a Frost Gauntlet in my left, but I was still unsure of how to use them effectively.     Out of nowhere, one of the other players started fighting the last opponent, and I thought, "This is my chance!" I jumped in, not really knowing what I was doing, and just started spamming my spells. To my surprise, I managed to hit both of them with a well-timed fireball, and they ended up taking each other out!     I couldn’t believe it when I saw the victory screen pop up. I was just standing there, laughing and shaking my head. I know it wasn’t a skillful win, but it felt amazing nonetheless!     Has anyone else had a win like this? I’d love to hear your stories!
__label__0 Yall know Omno is leaving Gamepass so I figured I would get it done. Wish I had time for the other ones leaving. Got a pay attention on that category. Oh well.  As for Omno, it was alright. The jumping was a bit jank but overall I would rate it 7 outta 10

__label__1 Good morning, fellow Big Brother fans! It's September 29, 2020, and we’re in the final stretch of BB22! With the end of the season approaching, I thought it would be a great time to discuss the morning feeds and what’s been happening in the house.    Last night was intense with the fallout from the latest eviction. I can’t believe how emotional everyone got! It seems like the house is really divided right now, especially with the Committee’s power starting to wane. I’m curious to see how the remaining houseguests will navigate the next few days.     What are your thoughts on the current alliances? Do you think anyone is in a good position to win the final HOH? I feel like some players are starting to make moves, but others are still playing it safe.     Also, what do you think about the potential final two scenarios? Who do you think has the best chance of winning the jury’s favor? I’m really torn between a few players, and I’d love to hear your opinions!    Let’s discuss all the juicy details from the feeds! What are you all watching for today?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my thoughts on Frank Ocean's impact on modern music. His ability to blend genres and create such emotionally resonant lyrics is something that really sets him apart from other artists. I recently revisited "Blonde" and was struck by how each track feels like a personal diary entry, yet it resonates with so many of us on different levels.     I also love how he experiments with sound and structure, especially in songs like "Nikes" and "Ivy." The way he plays with vocal layering and production techniques creates such a unique listening experience.     What are your favorite tracks from "Blonde" and why? How do you think Frank's music has influenced the current wave of R&B and hip-hop artists? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about the Modern Warfare reboot timeline and how it fits into the larger Call of Duty universe. Am I the only one who feels like it should be considered non-canon to the rest of the series? The tone and storytelling in the reboot feel so different from the classic titles.     When I think about the games that have a similar vibe, the only ones that come to mind are World at War and Black Ops 2. Those games had a gritty realism and emotional depth that I feel the reboot captures, but it just doesn’t mesh well with the more over-the-top elements of other titles like Advanced Warfare or Infinite Warfare.     I really appreciate the direction they took with the reboot, focusing on modern conflicts and moral ambiguity, but it feels like it stands apart from the rest of the franchise. What do you all think? Should the reboot timeline be its own separate entity, or do you think it should be integrated into the broader Call of Duty lore?
__label__0 Hi Everyone,    Just curious where everyone is shopping for car loans lately? I've heard rates are atrocious at the moment (like 8%) but I haven't started looking quite yet.    Unfortunately my Father passed recently and he left a 2021 Silverado with a $44k buyout on the lease. He asked me before passing if I'd like to buy it out, and that's my intention. We have had several hunting trips and some great memories in the vehicle and its the last piece of him I have, so I'm not here to debate whether or not to buy a pickup truck in the current climate. I have many reasons for owning one (side construction business) on top of the emotional attachment. Buyout will be in January 2023.    My sister suggested looking into a HELOC for the best rate right now, and that they'd often match your current mortgage rate for a loan (2.34% currently). Has anyone done this? My wife and I have never taken out a HELOC,  we are with First National and both have excellent credit.     All-in the truck will be about $50,600. I plan on putting down $20,600 leaving me $30k to finance. Would love to pay it off in 3 years if I can find a good rate.    Has anyone been in the same boat while vehicle shopping lately? Any advice for the best rate?    Thanks for your time,  Luke

__label__1 In this archived post, we take a look back at the incredible journey of the Tesla Roadster, particularly focusing on the efforts of Gruber Motors in saving parts and restoring these iconic vehicles. Gruber Motors has been a key player in the Tesla community, specializing in the repair and restoration of the original Roadster model.     The Roadster, which was Tesla's first production vehicle, has a unique place in automotive history, being the first highway-legal electric vehicle to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first electric vehicle to travel more than 200 miles on a single charge. However, as these vehicles age, finding replacement parts has become increasingly challenging.     Gruber Motors has dedicated itself to sourcing and manufacturing parts for the Roadster, ensuring that these vehicles can continue to be enjoyed by enthusiasts and collectors alike. Their efforts include everything from battery pack refurbishments to sourcing rare components that are no longer in production.     In this gallery series, we showcase some of the stunning restorations completed by Gruber Motors, highlighting the craftsmanship and dedication that goes into each project. From the sleek lines of the Roadster's body to the intricate details of its interior, these images capture the essence of what makes the Tesla Roadster a beloved classic.     As we look back at this post, it's a reminder of the importance of preserving automotive history and the role that dedicated companies like Gruber Motors play in keeping the spirit of innovation alive. Whether you're a long-time Roadster owner or a new fan of Tesla's legacy, this gallery serves as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Roadster.
__label__1 When you filled your bathtub and noticed the water was light blue, it could be due to a few reasons, but one common cause is copper. Copper can dissolve into the water from pipes, especially if the water is slightly acidic or if the pipes are old. This can happen more often in areas with soft water, which can corrode pipes more easily.    Now, about drinking the tap water: if you have a PUR water filter, it’s designed to remove many contaminants, including some metals like copper. However, it’s important to check the specific model of your filter to see what it removes. Generally, using a water filter can make your tap water safer to drink, but it’s always a good idea to test your water if you notice unusual colors or tastes.    If you’re concerned about the safety of your water, you might want to consider getting it tested, especially if you see blue water regularly. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid drinking the tap water until you’re sure it’s safe.
__label__1 I've been working on a family tree for my Warrior Cats OCs, and I thought it would be fun to share it with you all!     **Family Tree of the ShadowClan Cats:**    1. **Nightshadow** (Tom, Black with silver stripes, Green eyes) - The wise and respected leader of ShadowClan. He has a strong sense of justice and is known for his strategic mind.     - **Mate:** **Dawnwhisper** (She-cat, Light gray with white paws, Amber eyes) - A gentle and nurturing queen who often helps the clan with her healing skills.     - **Kits:**         - **Stormpaw** (Tom, Dark gray with a white chest, Blue eyes) - An ambitious apprentice who dreams of becoming a great warrior.         - **Willowkit** (She-cat, Brown tabby with green eyes) - A curious and adventurous kit who loves exploring the territory.    2. **Shadowfang** (Tom, Dark brown with black spots, Yellow eyes) - Nightshadow's brother, a fierce warrior known for his loyalty to the clan. He often trains the apprentices.     - **Mate:** **Frostfeather** (She-cat, White with gray patches, Ice blue eyes) - A skilled hunter and a loving mother.     - **Kits:**         - **Cinderpaw** (Tom, Ash gray with a black tail, Green eyes) - A clever apprentice who is always thinking of new tactics in battle.         - **Blossomkit** (She-cat, Calico with bright blue eyes) - A playful and energetic kit who loves to make friends.    I love how interconnected the clans can be, and I think it adds so much depth to the stories we create! What do you think? Do you have any family trees for your OCs? I'd love to hear about them!

__label__0 … I’m not saying I have one. Odds are pretty good that I don’t.     They say that 1/6 women will be stalked, and in that scenario I’m definitely like… the 5th woman in the statistic.     What I mean is… I wonder what my stalker sees if he/she/it exists… they watch me get up at X AM (if you’re out there I’m not giving you clues), and walk my dogs. They watch me sit on the couch and browse Reddit. They watch me go to work. They watch me come home and walk my dogs…     “No!”     “No, I said!”     “I can see you!”     “Leave one another ALONE!”     “Don’t eat that!”    “No!”    “Stop. Being. Assholes!!”    I say each thing multiple times while watching tv, making dinner, vacuuming up copious amounts of dog hair…    Another dog walk.     Are you still with me stalker? As I try to save $0.05 by convincing both dogs to poop simultaneously instead of one at a time… over and over… across multiple blocks? I don’t think you are…    If you are, you see me come home… inflict the dreaded “wait” command on my dogs as I feed them dinner… and then the rodeo starts.    Not the real rodeo. Because if I was busting broncos in my living room I could see you wanting to stalk me.     The dog rodeo. The rodeo where you chase them through the apartment while yelling at them for yelling at one another. The rodeo where you bribe them with peanut butter so that you can trim their nails, or practice your WWE moves while combing 8lbs of hair out of them and into the area rug. The rodeo where you have to force a 60 lb dog to be the little spoon so that you can brush his teeth. That rodeo.    If any stalker is still here… well he certainly has kinks.     He watches as I climb into bed… pulling up the covers with lightening fast reflexes so that dog hair doesn’t work its way all the way up my butt overnight.     “No!” I yell into the darkened room.    “No!”    “Get off your sister!!!”    “Stop chewing on your ass!”    “No! Goddamn it! Leave the laundry bin alone!”    “It’s bedtime you asshats!”    “Please… please just stop LICKING yourself!!!!”    These sweet hymns, sang in dulcet tones, lull the stalker to sleep…
__label__1 I feel you, man! Sometimes it just hits you, right? The urge to connect, to find someone special, or even just to have some fun. It’s like everyone around you is either in a relationship or talking about their crushes, and you’re just sitting there like, "What about me?"     I think it’s totally normal to feel this way, especially as a teenager. We’re at that age where everything feels heightened—emotions, desires, and even the pressure to fit in.     But here’s the thing: it’s important to remember that it’s okay to take your time. Building connections, whether they’re romantic or just friendships, takes time and effort. Plus, it’s better to wait for the right person than to rush into something just to say you’ve been there, done that.     Have you tried putting yourself out there? Maybe join some clubs, or try online dating if you’re comfortable with it. Just be yourself, and don’t stress too much about it. The right person will come along when you least expect it.     And hey, if you ever want to talk about it or share your experiences, this community is here for you! Let’s support each other in this journey. What do you think?
__label__1 I've been playing Warzone on PC for a while now, and I’ve noticed that the game takes up a massive amount of space on my hard drive. With all the updates and new content, it feels like it just keeps growing! I’m running low on storage and I’m wondering if there are any ways to reduce the game’s size without sacrificing too much content or performance.    I’ve heard about a few methods like uninstalling certain packs or using the game’s settings to manage storage, but I’m not sure what the best approach is.     Has anyone successfully reduced the size of Warzone on their PC? What steps did you take? Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Reddit awards are a way for users to show appreciation for posts and comments that they find particularly valuable, entertaining, or insightful. When you see a post or comment that you like, you can give it an award, which is essentially a form of recognition. Here’s a breakdown of how they work:    1. **Types of Awards**: There are various types of awards, ranging from simple ones like the "Silver" or "Gold" awards to more elaborate ones like the "Platinum" or themed awards (like the "Helpful" award). Each award has a different cost in Reddit coins, which you can purchase with real money or earn through Reddit activity.    2. **Giving Awards**: To give an award, you click on the "award" button below a post or comment. You’ll see a list of available awards along with their coin costs. Once you select an award and confirm, the recipient will see it on their post or comment, and it will also show up on their profile.    3. **Purpose of Awards**: Awards serve multiple purposes. They can enhance the visibility of a post, as posts with awards may be more likely to be seen by others. They also provide a way for users to express gratitude or appreciation for content that resonates with them. Additionally, some awards come with perks, like giving the recipient a temporary premium membership or other benefits.    4. **Feeling Accomplished**: While awards can be seen as a form of recognition, they also contribute to the community aspect of Reddit. Receiving awards can feel rewarding and can encourage users to continue contributing quality content.    5. **Limitations**: Keep in mind that awards are not a currency that can be traded or used for anything other than recognition. They don’t provide any direct benefits beyond the acknowledgment they give to the recipient.    In summary, Reddit awards are a fun way to engage with the community and show appreciation for content you enjoy. They add a layer of interaction beyond just upvotes and comments!
__label__0 My dad had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and after a summer of multiple hospital stays, he lost so much weight (down to about 99 lbs), I decided to get a gym membership (low impact treadmill so he can walk during the winter months) and a personal trainer who specializes in older individuals so she can slowly coach him back. Unfortunately, he ended up returning to the hospital and never made it (his disease progressed too much).    We had a full year gym membership which was prorated back. His personal training sessions, according to the trainer (who is a very lovely and honest person), he had 7 sessions outstanding as per her records but the computer only showed 5 sessions. The trainer's manager said that she could only refund the five sessions and since I wouldn't be getting my money back for the remaining two, I was told that I could transfer and use them for myself. Fair enough.    The problem started when I asked for the refund for the sessions that were still on the computer and was told by the personal training manager that I would have to speak to head office during business hours since she was no longer able to refund using the computer. Mind you, this was months after I originally purchased them and there was a large gap between that and when I asked her for the refund due to 1) My city's total lock-down 2) I had other priorities like dealing with the estate process and a huge bout of depression. I called corporate and the lady at the other end seemed displeased saying that the fitness manager 'just had to call her regional manager to approve the refund' instead of bouncing me around. Then I get a call from the same manager, who now completely forgot about my earlier conversations and denies ever telling me that I was getting a refund. Her words: "I am so truly sorry for your loss, but the fact of the matter is, we extended that courtesy and gave you complementary lessons, and since you didn't use them up, they're on you, so now you forfeit your money".    I am obviously displeased, I spoke to the gym manager (so many managers, but he's the manager of the whole gym whereas she's the personal fitness manager) and he proceeds to tell me that he talked to her as well as the district manager, and found out that the personal training manager had already spoken to the district manager and they're on the same page. Unfortunately he's not able to do anything. I called corporate again, and another lady told me that their job is to just relay the info back to the individual locations but that if they have a consensus, no one at corporate can override this.    I got a recording app and spoke to the personal trainer and she confirmed the outstanding sessions (no, I will not use that to throw the personal trainer under the bus as she's always been good). She asked me if I wanted to use them since now I won't be getting my money back, although I'm pretty sure that if she asks her manager then her offer to give me more classes will get rejected.    At this point, it's not solely about the money but the principle. Its bad enough that my dad passed away, but their greed, gaslighting, and lack of empathy is just awful.    My question is: Do I have any recourse?    I've already contacted Better Business Bureau and I'm going to need the original contract papers that my dad signed.    Thanks for any inputs.    &amp;#x200B;    Edit: The reason why 2 of the sessions were not officially on the system was because they were scheduled during his stay at the hospital in his last days for which we didn't give the gym 24 hours notice (i.e. priorities).
__label__1 I'm trying to remember an anime from the late 90s or early 2000s that had a really dynamic fight sequence, but it was animated in a style similar to Crayon Shin-chan. I distinctly recall the characters having exaggerated facial expressions and movements, which made the fight scenes both funny and intense at the same time.     The plot was a bit hazy, but I think it involved a group of friends or siblings who would often get into ridiculous situations, and the fights were more about their antics than actual combat. There was a lot of slapstick humor, and the animation style was very colorful and playful, reminiscent of Crayon Shin-chan's unique look.     I can't remember the title or any specific character names, but I know it left a strong impression on me because of how it blended humor with action. If anyone has any idea what this anime might be, I would really appreciate your help!
__label__1 I often find myself in situations where people recommend videos or articles that they think I should watch, especially if they relate to social skills or understanding emotions better. I appreciate the intention behind it, but I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the pressure to consume content that others deem important.     For instance, a friend recently sent me a video about "how to read body language" and insisted that it would help me in social situations. While I understand the value of such information, I don't feel like I need to watch it to validate my experiences or improve my interactions.     I prefer to learn at my own pace and through my own methods, whether that’s through personal experiences, books, or discussions with others who understand my perspective.     Does anyone else feel this way? How do you handle situations where others push you to engage with content that you don’t feel is necessary for you?
__label__0 People might say its because she made Jim give up Athlead but that was only because she was overwhelmed as a mother of two without the father there.

__label__0 Disclaimer : I never meant to support them. I'm just curious and my only time that i have to fight it is once in GRB.        I just reached French air 6.0 with AD-4 after big grind with BP Mustang and obviously the first thing that flocking in air br 6.0 is Ju 288 C. But usually they just nice enough to leave me alone when i'm ground pounding(or after i asked to do that). And people who flew them are nice enough to have a little relax chat with me and my team while either of us do their own things.        I might not have position to say positive things about them cuz i never dogfight with them. But i'm a little bit surprise when people saw them like monster and that's made me wonder why.
__label__1 I've been diving into some traditional military strategy books lately, and I find them incredibly insightful, not just for understanding historical battles but also for applying those principles to Age of Empires II.     Books like "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and "On War" by Carl von Clausewitz offer timeless strategies that can be surprisingly relevant in our gameplay. For instance, the importance of positioning, resource management, and understanding your opponent's strengths and weaknesses can all be traced back to these classic texts.     I’m curious if anyone else here reads these kinds of books and how they’ve influenced your approach to AOE2. Do you have any recommendations for other military strategy literature? Or perhaps specific strategies you've adopted from these readings that have improved your game? Let’s share some insights!
__label__1 I just wanted to share my excitement about the recent announcement regarding free captain respecs! As someone who has been experimenting with different builds and playstyles, this is a game-changer.     For those who might not be aware, Wargaming is offering free respecs for captains, allowing us to reallocate skill points without any cost. This is a fantastic opportunity to try out new strategies or adapt to the current meta without the usual penalty of losing hard-earned experience points.     I’ve been playing a lot of cruisers lately, and I’m eager to test out some of the new skills that were introduced in the last patch. I’m particularly interested in the changes to the concealment and survivability skills, as I think they could really enhance my gameplay.     Has anyone else taken advantage of this? What builds are you planning to try out? Let’s share our ideas and maybe even some tips on how to maximize our captains’ potential!     Happy sailing, everyone!
__label__0 Hello, how’s everyone doing? I’m looking for a long-term roleplay partner themed around superheroes/supervillains and such. I’m familiar with a good bit of Marvel and DC although I’m not looking to play a canon character myself—nor expecting anyone else to play one. If you wanted to RP something based on those fandoms, then I’m fine with it, though. Bring any OCs you already have or we can figure out characters together!    I’ve been writing for about ten years. I’m 24 so I’d prefer partners at least 18. A matter of comfort, honestly. I’m in CST but I don’t mind roleplaying with partners in other time zones.     I like to tackle a variety of themes with my roleplay, but I prefer action, adventure, and a bit of humor. I also prefer third-person but I can do first-person as well. I’m semi-literate to literate since I write more when inspired. I keep up with my partner.     All I’m looking for is someone with a few ideas to share and willing to discuss plots and ideas before we get an RP started.     Thank you for reading and hope to hear from you. If you’re interested then shoot me a message or chat. I don’t have a discord set up currently but it's in the works.

__label__1 ...I have a theory about the true nature of the Dark World in Deltarune and how it connects to the Light World. Hear me out!    In Chapter 1, we see Kris, Ralsei, and Susie enter the Dark World through a mysterious portal in the school. This got me thinking about the nature of these portals and how they might relate to the characters' identities and their struggles in the Light World.     What if the Dark World is a manifestation of their inner conflicts and desires? Each character seems to have their own issues they are grappling with. For example, Kris has a clear struggle with their identity and the expectations placed upon them, while Susie deals with her reputation and the need to be seen as tough. Ralsei, on the other hand, represents hope and the desire for connection.     Now, consider the fact that the Dark World is filled with monsters and challenges that reflect these inner struggles. The enemies they face could symbolize the fears and doubts that each character has in the Light World.     Furthermore, the way the Dark World changes based on the choices we make in the Light World suggests that there is a deeper connection between the two realms. What if the actions we take in the Light World directly influence the Dark World, and vice versa? This could mean that the characters are not just battling external foes, but also their own internal demons.     I know this might sound a bit far-fetched, but I think it adds a layer of depth to the story. The Dark World could be more than just a setting for adventure; it could be a reflection of the characters' growth and the choices they make.     What do you all think? Am I reading too much into this, or do you see the connections as well? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 Freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer have become increasingly popular, but they each have different business models and profit margins. I'm curious to know which of these platforms is the most profitable and what factors contribute to their success.     For instance, Upwork charges a sliding service fee based on the freelancer's earnings, while Fiverr has a fixed fee structure. Does one model seem to generate more revenue than the other? Additionally, how do user engagement and the number of active freelancers on each platform impact their profitability?     If anyone has insights or data on the financial performance of these platforms, or if you have personal experiences that highlight which platform seems to be thriving more, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I’m looking to replace the track lights in my kitchen, but I’m not sure where to start. The current setup is quite outdated and doesn’t provide enough light for the space. I’ve done some research and found a few options, but I’m overwhelmed by the variety of styles and types available.    Here are a few questions I have:  1. What’s the best type of track lighting for a kitchen? I’m considering LED options for energy efficiency.  2. How do I determine the right length of track I need? My kitchen is about 12 feet long.  3. Are there any specific brands or models that you would recommend? I want something that’s both functional and stylish.  4. What’s the best way to install the new track lights? I’m somewhat handy, but I’ve never done electrical work before.    Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

__label__1 In the mirror, I see a stranger,    A reflection of the self I know,    Yet, beneath the surface, a tempest brews,    A battle of shadows, a dance of woe.      Me, myself, and the truth collide,    In the quiet corners of my mind,    Where whispers of doubt and echoes of fear,    Entwine with the light I struggle to find.      I wear a mask, a crafted facade,    To shield the world from my inner storm,    But the truth, relentless, gnaws at my core,    Demanding to be seen, to be reborn.      What is truth but a fickle friend,    A double-edged sword that cuts so deep,    It reveals the beauty, the scars, the pain,    In the silence of night, it robs me of sleep.      I am the architect of my own demise,    Building walls to keep the truth at bay,    Yet, in the rubble of my own design,    I find the courage to face another day.      So here I stand, stripped and bare,    Me, myself, and the truth entwined,    Embracing the chaos, the light, the dark,    In this fragile heart, a new strength I find.      For in the acceptance of all that I am,    The fractured pieces begin to mend,    Me, myself, and the truth, a trinity,    Together we rise, together we transcend.
__label__1 In God of War (2018), Kratos does indeed know that Mimir is a god. When they first meet, Mimir introduces himself as the "Smartest Man Alive" and reveals his past as a god of wisdom. Kratos, being a former god himself, recognizes Mimir's significance and the weight of his knowledge. Throughout their journey, Kratos often relies on Mimir's insights and guidance, which further emphasizes that he acknowledges Mimir's divine status.     However, Kratos's attitude towards gods has changed significantly since his days in Greece. He is more cautious and wary of divine beings, which is evident in how he interacts with Mimir. While he respects Mimir's wisdom, he also maintains a level of detachment, reflecting his complex relationship with gods in general.     What do you all think? Does Kratos's relationship with Mimir change your perspective on how he views gods in Norse mythology?

__label__1 I’m in a bit of a bind and could really use some advice from this community. I live in British Columbia and recently found out that my landlord is planning to sell the property I’m renting. I’ve been a good tenant for over two years, always paying my rent on time and taking care of the place.     The landlord hasn’t given me any formal notice yet, but I overheard them talking about it with a friend. I’m worried about what this means for me and my living situation.     1. **What are my rights as a tenant in this situation?** I know that in BC, landlords need to provide proper notice before terminating a tenancy, but I’m not sure how that works if they’re selling the property.     2. **If they do sell, can the new owner evict me immediately?** I’ve heard mixed things about whether a new owner can just kick out existing tenants or if they have to honor the current lease.     3. **What should I do to protect myself?** Should I start looking for a new place now, or is it better to wait until I get official notice?     Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
__label__1 I'm considering switching to private health insurance in Germany and I have a few questions about how it works. I've heard that private health insurance can offer better coverage and shorter waiting times compared to the public system, but I'm also aware that it can be more expensive and that there are some risks involved.     1. What are the main differences between private and public health insurance in Germany?   2. Are there specific eligibility requirements for switching to private health insurance?   3. How does the cost of private health insurance vary, and what factors should I consider when choosing a plan?   4.

__label__1 I've been playing League of Legends for a while now, and I recently found myself stuck in Iron 4. It's been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to share some thoughts and maybe get some advice from others who have been in a similar situation.    First off, I know that Iron is the lowest rank, and it can be tough to climb out of it. I often feel like I'm playing with teammates who don't understand the basics of the game, like map awareness or objective control. It can be disheartening when you try to communicate strategies, but it feels like no one is on the same page.    I've been focusing on improving my own gameplay, but I often find myself getting frustrated when my teammates make questionable decisions. I try to stay positive and encourage them, but sometimes it feels like I'm just wasting my breath.     One thing I've noticed is that I tend to play champions that I enjoy rather than focusing on the meta. I know that playing meta champions can help, but I also want to have fun while playing. Is it better to stick to champions I enjoy, or should I prioritize climbing by playing the strongest picks?    Also, I've been trying to work on my mechanics and decision-making, but I feel like I hit a wall sometimes. Are there any specific resources or tips you guys would recommend for improving at this rank?     I appreciate any advice or support from the community. I know I can get out of Iron, but it feels like a long road ahead. Let's keep pushing through together!
__label__1 I've noticed a growing trend in the UK lately, and it's quite striking! It seems like every third person I see is walking around with filled lips. Whether it's in the city, at the pub, or even just out for a stroll, those plump pouts are everywhere.     I can't help but wonder what this says about beauty standards in our society. Is it a sign of confidence, or are we all just succumbing to the pressures of social media and celebrity culture?     I remember when a more natural look was the norm, but now it feels like lip fillers have become as common as getting a haircut. What do you all think? Are you for or against this trend? Have you had any experiences with lip fillers, or do you prefer to keep things natural? Let's discuss!

Life can get a bit lonely sometimes, and I think it would be great to have some interesting conversations and share experiences with others.    I’m into a variety of things—music, movies, books, and I love exploring new hobbies. I enjoy everything from classic rock to indie films, and I’m always on the lookout for recommendations. I also like to stay active, whether it’s going for a run, hitting the gym, or just taking long walks to clear my head.

Whether you want to chat about your day, share your favorite Netflix series, or discuss the latest book you read, I’m all ears!     I’m open to chatting via messages or even setting up a video call if we hit it off. Let’s see where this goes! Looking forward to hearing from you!
__label__1 I'm trying to create a custom Node2D in Godot that has resize handles, allowing users to click and drag to resize the node. I want to achieve a simple rectangular shape that can be resized from its corners and edges. Here’s what I have so far, but I’m struggling with the implementation of the resize handles and the dragging functionality.    ### Step 1: Create the Custom Node  First, I created a new script for my custom Node2D called `ResizableRect.gd`:    ```gdscript  extends Node2D    var rect_size = Vector2(100, 100)  var is_resizing = false  var resize_handle_size = 10  var current_handle = null    func _draw():      draw_rect(Rect2(Vector2.ZERO, rect_size), Color(1, 1, 1))      draw_resize_handles()    func draw_resize_handles():      var handle_positions = [          Vector2(0, 0), // Top-left          Vector2(rect_size.x, 0), // Top-right          Vector2(0, rect_size.y), // Bottom-left          Vector2(rect_size.x, rect_size.y) // Bottom-right      ]      for pos in handle_positions:          draw_rect(Rect2(pos - Vector2(resize_handle_size / 2, resize_handle_size / 2), Vector2(resize_handle_size, resize_handle_size)), Color(1, 0, 0))    func _input(event):      if event is InputEventMouseButton:          if event.pressed:              check_handle_pressed(event.position)          else:              is_resizing = false              current_handle = null      elif event is InputEventMouseMotion and is_resizing:          resize_rect(event.position)    func check_handle_pressed(mouse_pos):      for i in range(4):          var handle_pos = get_handle_position(i)          if handle_pos.distance_to(mouse_pos) < resize_handle_size:              is_resizing = true              current_handle = i              break    func get_handle_position(index):      match index:          0: return Vector2(0, 0)          1: return Vector2(rect_size.x, 0)          2: return Vector2(0, rect_size.y)          3: return Vector2(rect_size.x, rect_size.y)    func resize_rect(mouse_pos):      match current_handle:          0: rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)          1: rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)          2: rect_size.y = max(mouse_pos.y, 10)          3:               rect_size.x = max(mouse_pos.x, 10)              rect_size.y = max(mouse_pos.y, 10)      update()  # Request redraw  ```    ### Step 2: Using the Custom Node  To use this custom node, I added it to my scene:  1. Create a new scene and add a `Node2D` as the root.  2. Attach the `ResizableRect.gd` script to a new `Node2D` child.  3. Call `update()` in the `_process` function to ensure it redraws when resized.    ### Step 3: Testing  When I run the scene, I can see the rectangle and the red resize handles. However, I’m having issues with the resizing logic. The rectangle does not resize correctly when dragging the handles, especially when dragging the top-right and bottom-right handles.     ### Questions  1. How can I improve the resizing logic to ensure the rectangle resizes correctly from all corners?  2. Is there a better way to handle the input events for resizing?  3. Any tips on improving the visual feedback when hovering over the resize handles?    Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I've been playing a lot of Free For All (FFA) matches in Age of Empires IV lately, and I've noticed that teaming can really skew the balance of the game. It often leads to one or two players dominating the match while others are left to fend for themselves. I wanted to propose a potential solution to mitigate this issue and encourage more fair play.    What if we implemented a system where players could report teaming behavior? If a player is reported multiple times in a single match for teaming, they could receive a temporary matchmaking penalty or be placed in a separate queue for FFA games? This way, it would discourage players from forming alliances that disrupt the competitive nature of FFA.    Additionally, we could introduce a feature that randomly assigns players to different teams at the start of the match, making it impossible for players to coordinate with each other before the game begins. This could help create a more chaotic and unpredictable environment, which is part of the fun of FFA.    I'd love to hear your thoughts on this! Have you experienced issues with teaming in FFA? What solutions do you think could work to improve the experience for everyone?
__label__1 Sanjay Dutt has recently deleted all his tweets and Instagram posts related to the film "Prithviraj," which has sparked a lot of speculation among fans and industry insiders. Some believe that this could be due to the film's underwhelming performance at the box office, leading Dutt to distance himself from the project. Others are suggesting that there might be some behind-the-scenes drama or disagreements with the production team that prompted this move.    It's also worth noting that Sanjay Dutt has always been known for his candidness and might have felt that the film did not meet his expectations or align with his brand. Whatever the reason, this sudden deletion has left many wondering about the dynamics at play in Bollywood, especially with such a high-profile film. What do you all think? Is it just a strategic move, or is there more to the story?
__label__1 Ivana Trump, the first wife of former President Donald Trump, has passed away at the age of 73. Known for her vibrant personality and entrepreneurial spirit, Ivana was a prominent figure in the fashion and business world, having launched her own lines of clothing, accessories, and beauty products. She was also a mother to three of Trump's children: Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric.    Her death has sparked a wave of tributes from friends, family, and public figures, reflecting on her impact and the legacy she leaves behind. Ivana was not only a businesswoman but also a socialite who played a significant role in the New York City scene during the 1980s and 1990s.     In recent years, she had maintained a public presence, often speaking about her relationship with Donald Trump and her life experiences. The cause of her death has not been disclosed yet, but her passing marks the end of an era for many who followed her life and career.     As the news spreads, many are remembering her not just as the ex-wife of a former president, but as a strong, independent woman who carved out her own path in a challenging world.
__label__0 Hello, I am an international student transfer. I applied to CSUF for Spring 2023, but I have been approved for OPT program( I can work for 1 year). If I want to study at CSUF in Fall 2023 instead of Spring 2023, do I have to apply again?    Thank you
__label__1 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has emphasized the need for a stronger voice from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in the Pacific region to enhance national security. In a recent statement, Albanese highlighted the importance of media in fostering connections and understanding among Pacific nations, which he believes is crucial for Australia’s strategic interests. He pointed out that a well-informed public can better appreciate the complexities of regional issues, thereby strengthening Australia’s diplomatic ties. The Prime Minister's call comes amid growing geopolitical tensions in the Pacific, where Australia aims to counter increasing influence from other powers. Albanese's remarks suggest a commitment to not only bolster media presence but also to ensure that Australian perspectives are effectively communicated across the region.

__label__0 hi, I made a character (first photo), but I try to rig it, somehow it wont work, is there somebody to help me?    second: [https://ibb.co/GpcN84k](https://ibb.co/GpcN84k)    https://preview.redd.it/nqyxs4y927m51.jpg?width=1862&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f471640ac40f86a1a1aa50a3e5ebece863e036
__label__1 I've been reflecting a lot on the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM) and the discussions surrounding it lately. It seems like many people are feeling a pull towards it, often believing that it represents a more authentic or reverent form of worship compared to the Novus Ordo. While I completely understand the appeal and the beauty of the TLM, I think it's important to remind ourselves that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.    For many, the TLM is a deeply enriching experience, filled with tradition and a sense of the sacred that can sometimes feel lacking in the more contemporary Mass. However, we must also recognize that every form of the Mass has its own strengths and weaknesses. The Novus Ordo, for instance, has made the liturgy more accessible to a wider audience, allowing for greater participation and understanding among the faithful.     It's easy to romanticize the past and think that the TLM is the solution to all our liturgical woes, but we should also consider the challenges that come with it. The TLM can sometimes create divisions within the Church, and not everyone feels comfortable or welcomed in that setting. Additionally, the emphasis on tradition can sometimes overshadow the need for pastoral care and outreach in our communities.    So, as we navigate our feelings about the TLM and its place in our faith, let's remember to appreciate the beauty and grace present in all forms of the Mass. Each has its own unique gifts to offer, and ultimately, our focus should be on Christ and the Eucharist, regardless of the liturgical style. Let's strive for unity and understanding, recognizing that our faith is not confined to one particular expression.
__label__1 In the context of the "Stranger Things" universe, the Demogorgon is a creature from the Upside Down, and its sensory capabilities are quite different from those of typical Earth creatures. While it is often described as having a keen sense of smell, the mechanics of how it perceives its environment are not explicitly detailed in the series, leading to some speculation.    1. **Alternative Senses**: The Demogorgon may not rely solely on traditional senses like smell or sight as we understand them. Creatures from other dimensions often have unique adaptations that allow them to sense their surroundings in ways that are not familiar to us. For example, it could potentially use echolocation, thermal sensing, or even some form of electromagnetic perception to detect living beings.    2. **Blood Detection**: The claim that the Demogorgon can smell blood might not be limited to the physical act of smelling as we know it. It could be that the creature has evolved to detect certain chemical signals or pheromones released by living beings, particularly when they are injured or frightened. This could explain its ability to track prey even when they are not actively bleeding.    3. **Movement and Heat**: The Demogorgon is also shown to be highly sensitive to movement and heat. Even if a creature is not bleeding, the Demogorgon might be able to sense the heat signature of a living being or detect subtle movements, allowing it to attack even stationary targets. This could be similar to how some predators on Earth can sense the presence of prey through vibrations or changes in their environment.    4. **Instinctual Behavior**: The Demogorgon’s behavior might also be driven by instinct rather than conscious thought. It could be programmed to attack anything that it perceives as a threat or potential prey, regardless of whether it can smell blood or not. This instinctual drive could lead it to attack stationary objects or creatures that it senses in its vicinity.    In summary, while the Demogorgon’s sensory capabilities are not fully explained in "Stranger Things," it likely relies on a combination of alternative senses, instinctual behavior, and possibly even chemical detection to hunt and attack its prey. This ambiguity adds to the creature's mystique and the overall horror of the series.
__label__1 I've been on Accutane for about three months now, and I've noticed that my lips are getting extremely dry and chapped. I've been using lip balm constantly, but it doesn't seem to help much. I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced this and what tips you might have for managing the dryness.     Also, is there a specific type of lip balm that works better for you? I've tried a few different brands, but I'm open to suggestions.     Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 I mean next year there are 7 playoff locks in the East assuming that there aren't major moves(Milwaukee, Boston, Miami, Toronto, Brooklyn, Indiana, Philadelphia). The rest of the east is pretty much lottery teams and teams that would probably finish under .500. Looking at the west I could make the case that all the west teams could make the playoffs except for Minnesota and maybe Sacramento but I could guarantee that teams like San Antonio, Phoenix, New Orleans, Memphis would have a more superior record in the east given there are like 5 lottery teams in the East(Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Charlotte, Cleveland).
__label__0 Before I dropped out of college (which has nothing to do with this story) some fucking horrifying happened     Me and my roommate would stay up all night in college and read r/nosleep posts but one night we decided to sit on the rooftop (it was a small college)    We stayed up there for about 2 1/2 hours it was 10:00 when we got up there.    When we went back to our dorm I realized my roommate wasn’t with me and I was like “maybe he went to the bathroom or something”     But 20 minutes passed and I still never saw him I thought he was playing a prank on me or something so I went to the bathroom    In the bathroom I was surprised that I didn’t see him but I still thought he was pranking me so I went to bed.    I got the urge to wake up at 3:00 am and I freaked out when he wasn’t in then room.    I went to check the bathroom but he wasn’t there either at this point I was like “he went to a bar or a drug dealer or something”    The next day I decided to go home but being the dumbass I am I didn’t tell anybody about my roommate    When I went home which was only about 15 minutes away I heard a slight knock which I lived with my parents and my brother and 2 sisters but they were asleep right after I went into my bedroom.    Then I heard another slight knock at this point I was scared to death I tried to call 911 on my phone but I was shaking so bad I couldn’t    Instead I dialed “913412” but I knew I fucked up so I didn’t press the call button    I decided to peek at the window security camera and there was a PERSON there   I opened the window immediately and it was my roommate there with a knife stabbed in him    I pulled him inside which he was shaking and barley breathing I called 911 and I actually dialed 911 this time here’s the call from my memory    “Dispatcher: 911 whats your emergency”  “Me: my friend is lying here almost dead with a knife stabbed in him”  “Dispatcher: do you know if he stabbed himself or if someone stabbed him”  “Me: no”  “Dispatcher: a bunch of instructions I don’t remember”  “Me: answers all the questions and does the instructions”  “Dispatcher: stay on the call with me until help are there”  “Me: ok”  “Dispatcher: is he still breathing?”  “Me: barley”  “Me: police are outside”  “Dispatcher: ok bye”    They think they caught the man who stabbed him which was a man who overdosed on cocaine who admitted    My friend was to weak to speak (he’s fine now) so he couldn’t say anything about the man    That was a few years ago    I forgot about it until about a year ago I was on a walk and this tall ass thing is walking right behind me but I was like a drunk man it’s fine just turn    But in a deep voice which was deeeeeeep he said “I stabbed your friend” I ran to my home where I have my wife and 3 kids  And told my wife everything    I saw him outside our house WHICH WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING but as I was looking at him he started spinning as fast as a race car going full speed    Me and my wife were like this man is not human just like that he disappeared my friend stayed with us the next few months until he could a apartment to pay rent in    He doing fine now but the police were never able to see the fucked up figure again so It’s still alive and probably out there somewhere

__label__1 I recently completed a One City Challenge (OCC) with the Khmer civilization led by Jayavarman VII, achieving a religious victory by turn 150, and I wanted to share my experience and strategies with the community.    Starting off, I focused heavily on early faith generation. The Khmer's unique ability to gain extra food and faith from rivers was a game-changer, allowing me to grow my city quickly while also generating enough faith to found a religion early on. I prioritized building the Holy Site as soon as possible, placing it next to the river for maximum adjacency bonuses.    For my religion, I went with the following beliefs:  - **Divine Spark**: This provided extra Great Person points, which helped me secure key religious figures early in the game.  - **Religious Community**: This belief allowed me to grow my city population faster, which was crucial for maintaining a strong economy and producing units.  - **Theology**: I picked this as my first enhancement to boost my faith output even further.    By focusing on spreading my religion early, I was able to convert neighboring city-states and even a couple of AI civilizations. I used missionaries and apostles strategically, ensuring I had enough to counter any potential religious pressure from opponents.     I also made sure to build the Temple of Angkor, which not only provided additional faith but also allowed me to enhance my religion further. The extra housing from the Temple was beneficial for my city’s growth, especially since I was limited to one city.    As I approached the mid-game, I focused on diplomacy and alliances with other civilizations to ensure they wouldn’t interfere with my religious plans. I found that maintaining good relationships helped me avoid conflicts that could derail my victory.    By turn 150, I had successfully spread my religion to a significant portion of the world, and I was able to achieve a religious victory. The combination of Khmer's unique abilities and a focused strategy on faith generation and spreading my religion made this OCC a fun and rewarding challenge.    I’d love to hear if anyone else has tried a similar strategy or if you have any tips for improving on this approach!

__label__1 Hey everyone!     I thought it would be fun to create a thread where we can share our experiences with cheaters in PUBG Mobile, but with a twist! Instead of just reporting them, let’s vent a little and share our frustrations.     Have you ever been in a match where you felt like you were doing great, only to be taken out by someone who clearly had an unfair advantage? Maybe you’ve encountered players with impossible aim, or those who seem to have unlimited health. It can be super frustrating, especially when you’ve put in the effort to improve your skills.     Feel free to share your stories, screenshots, or even just your thoughts on how cheaters impact the game. Let’s get it all out in the open! And remember, while it’s important to report cheaters, it’s also okay to express how it makes you feel.     Happy gaming, and may your next match be cheat-free! 💪🎮
__label__1 I've been thinking about the vehicle balance in GTA Online and how some of the lesser-used vehicles could really use a buff or a rework to make them more viable in the current meta. Here are a few non-cliché vehicles that I think deserve some love:    1. **Tampa** - This classic muscle car has a lot of potential but feels underwhelming compared to newer vehicles. A slight speed boost and better handling could make it a fun choice for races and car meets.    2. **Brawler** - The Brawler is a cool off-road vehicle, but it struggles against the likes of the Insurgent and the Nightshark. Giving it a bit more armor or improving its off-road capabilities could make it a solid choice for those who want to take the fight off the beaten path.    3. **Vigilante** - While it’s iconic, the Vigilante feels a bit overshadowed by the Oppressor Mk II. If it had a more powerful weapon or better speed, it could reclaim its spot as a go-to choice for vigilante justice.    4. **Tornado** - This classic convertible is a fan favorite, but it’s not really competitive in any aspect. A performance boost or some unique customization options could make it a fun vehicle for cruising around Los Santos.    5. **Dukes** - The Dukes is a great homage to classic muscle cars, but it’s often overlooked. Improving its acceleration and adding some unique features could make it a more appealing option for players who love that retro vibe.    What do you all think? Are there any other vehicles you feel deserve a rework? Let’s discuss!
__label__1 I took a break from Genshin Impact for a few months, and now I'm thinking about diving back in. I remember the basics, but I feel a bit overwhelmed with all the new characters, events, and updates that have come out since I last played.     For those of you who have taken breaks and returned, how difficult was it for you to get back into the swing of things? Did you find it easy to catch up on the story and events? Are there any tips you would recommend for someone trying to reorient themselves in the game?     Also, are there any must-have characters or weapons that I should focus on now that I’m back? I’d love to hear your experiences and advice!

__label__1 I recently turned 18 and just got my license a couple of months ago. I'm considering buying a NA Miata as my first car because I love the idea of a lightweight, fun-to-drive roadster, and I'm willing to learn how to do my own repairs. However, I'm a bit concerned about the insurance costs.     Does anyone have experience with insuring a Miata as a young driver? What should I expect in terms of monthly premiums? I know it can vary widely based on factors like location, driving history, and coverage options, but any ballpark figures or tips on how to keep costs down would be really helpful!     Thanks in advance!

__label__0 I love art and drawing so much. When i was a baby, my mom would draw to entertain me and that inspired me to draw. I did it all the time.     When I was 11 years old, I was bullied by my entire class. I became depressed and started using the internet as a coping mechanism. Eventually, I stopped making art. It’s been years since I last drew something. I still love the hobby, but I can’t motivate myself to get back into it. I wish I could though.

__label__0 Do these types of noises drive anyone else insane? I absolutely cannot tolerate the constant buzzing sound of appliances like the fridge, water dispenser, or whatever else makes noise in my apartment. Sometimes there’s a buzzing sound in my bathroom and I have no idea what causes it or exactly where the noise is coming from. Same with other parts of my apartment.     But these noises make me want to rip my hair out or rampage around my apartment and destroy anything that might responsible for causing that unbearable buzzing noise.     I’m so frustrated and feel like I’m going crazy, but I’m also wondering if my apartment just has shitty appliances. Is it the norm for there to be so much buzzing noises coming from household appliances/fans/vents?    Are the rest of you generally more tolerant of similar noises? Or also intolerant?    How do others cope with similar issues?
__label__1 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for gas separation applications due to their tunable porosity and high surface area. However, the presence of defects, particularly missing-linker defects, can significantly influence the performance of COF membranes in gas separation processes. In this study, we investigate the impact of these defects on the efficiency of CO2 separation from gas mixtures.    We synthesized a series of COF membranes with controlled amounts of missing-linker defects and characterized their structural properties using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results indicate that the introduction of missing-linker defects not only alters the pore structure but also enhances the gas permeability of the membranes.    To evaluate the CO2 separation performance, we conducted gas permeation tests under various conditions. The membranes with optimized missing-linker defects exhibited significantly improved CO2/N2 selectivity compared to their defect-free counterparts. This enhancement is attributed to the increased free volume and altered diffusion pathways created by the defects, which facilitate the preferential transport of CO2 molecules.    Furthermore, we explored the relationship between the density of missing-linker defects and the separation performance, revealing a critical threshold beyond which the selectivity begins to decline due to excessive disorder in the framework.    Our findings suggest that carefully engineered missing-linker defects can be a powerful strategy to enhance the gas separation capabilities of COF membranes, paving the way for more efficient CO2 capture technologies. This work opens new avenues for the design of advanced materials tailored for specific gas separation applications.
__label__1 I recently built a PC with an MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, and I've been experiencing some issues with the fans. Here’s a breakdown of the problem:    - **Fan Behavior**: The fans on the GPU seem to be running inconsistently. Sometimes they spin up to full speed when the GPU is under load, but other times they don’t spin at all, even when the temperatures are rising. I’ve noticed that the GPU can reach temperatures of around 80°C during gaming sessions, which seems a bit high.    - **Software Monitoring**: I’m using MSI Afterburner to monitor the temperatures and fan speeds. The fan curve is set to default, but I’m not sure if it’s functioning correctly. I’ve tried adjusting the fan curve manually, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect on the fan behavior.    - **Physical Inspection**: I’ve checked the GPU for any dust buildup and cleaned it out, but the issue persists. I also made sure that the GPU is properly seated in the PCIe slot and that the power connectors are securely attached.    - **Other Components**: My PC specs are as follows:    1. CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X    2. RAM: 16 GB DDR4 3200 MHz    3. Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B550-PLUS    4. PSU: 650W 80+ Gold    I’m wondering if this is a common issue with the 3070 Ti or if it could be a sign of a failing fan or a software issue. Should I consider RMAing the card, or is there a way to troubleshoot this further? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I'm in the market for a gaming laptop and could use some advice! I'm looking for something that can handle modern games well without breaking the bank. Here are some details about what I'm looking for:    **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**    * **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase:**  $1,200 or less, based in the US.    * **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  Yes, I’m open to refurbished options if they come with a warranty.    * **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  (1) Performance, (2) build quality, (3) battery life. I want something that can run games smoothly.    * **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  I prefer something that’s not too heavy, as I plan to take it to friends’ houses for gaming sessions.    * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  I’d like at least a 15.6” screen for a good gaming experience.    * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  Primarily gaming. I want to play games like Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Fortnite at decent settings.    * **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  I’m aiming for at least 60 FPS on high settings for most games.    * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  A good keyboard is important for me, especially for long gaming sessions. RGB lighting would be a nice bonus!    I’ve been looking at options like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus and the Acer Predator Helios, but I’d love to hear your recommendations or any other models I should consider. Thanks in advance!

__label__1 I've been doing some research on water softeners and I wanted to clarify something. When it comes to running water through a water softener, should I be running just hot water or all water (both hot and cold) through it?     I've heard mixed opinions on this. Some say that only the hot water should be softened because that's where most of the issues with scale buildup occur, especially in appliances like water heaters and dishwashers. Others suggest that all water should be softened to prevent any potential issues with plumbing and fixtures throughout the house.     What do you all recommend? Is there a best practice for this? Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 With the recent update, I've been experimenting with the three additional barracks that we can now build. It's been a game-changer for my strategy!     For those who might not be aware, the update allows us to have a total of six barracks, which means we can train troops much faster and diversify our army compositions. I’ve found that having multiple barracks allows me to create different troop combinations for various attack strategies without having to wait long periods for training.     For example, I’ve been using one barrack for training mass Baby Dragons for farming, while another is dedicated to training Electro Dragons for war attacks. This flexibility has really improved my overall efficiency in both farming and war.     I’m curious to hear how others are utilizing their extra barracks! What troop combinations are you finding most effective? Have you noticed a significant change in your gameplay since the update? Let’s share some strategies!
__label__0 I'm a professional artist/muralist/illustrator and have been researching different EU countries to move to. I'm trying to find out which are the best for artists.    I speak German and Norwegian, which might help, but I also love learning languages and wouldn't find it a hassle to have to start over again, if I end up choosing a different country. I have lived in the deep south and currently live in one of the coldest American cities, so I am fine with any type of weather. I prefer to not own a car, so an area that is bike or pedestrian friendly would be great. I have many friends in Germany and my boyfriend is from Norway, so his whole family lives there but I would be open to other places that are very art friendly.     My main questions are, is it difficult to get approved for visas as an artist? I know it helps to have a sought after skill, but I'm not sure how in demand artists are. I also have shared custody of my two young children. I would have them during the school year, so I need to consider schools, as well.    Thank you for any help!
__label__1 I've been using Reddit for a while now, and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it's an incredible platform for finding niche communities and engaging in discussions about topics I'm passionate about. I love how you can find support and advice in subreddits like /r/relationship_advice or /r/AskReddit, where people share their experiences and insights.    However, I also find that some parts of Reddit can be quite toxic. The anonymity can lead to people being overly harsh or judgmental, especially in heated discussions. I've seen some really negative comments that can discourage people from sharing their thoughts or seeking help.     Overall, I think Reddit is a double-edged sword. It has the potential to be a great resource for information and community, but it can also be a place where negativity thrives. I try to focus on the positive aspects and engage with the communities that uplift and support each other.
__label__0 The question is as clear as the post title. I know the year is yet to end, but who according to all of you is the most improved wrestler or wrestlers of 2022.     Doesn't have to be a rookie, even the biggest of stars are constantly evolving their game. Would also love if names don't just come from two or three of the specific big promotions.     I'm anticipating one or two names from NXT 2.0 and I agree to them, but would love for more names from way out there as well.

__label__1 I've been dealing with a situation for a long time now, and I really need some advice on how to handle it. I'm in my early twenties, and there's a woman in her fifties who has been insulting me since middle school. At first, I thought it was just typical bullying, but as the years have gone by, her comments have only gotten worse.    She often makes snide remarks about my appearance, my intelligence, and even my choices in life. I’ve tried to ignore her, but it’s hard when I see her regularly in my community. I’ve also confronted her a couple of times, asking her to stop, but she just laughs it off and continues with her insults.    I’ve talked to friends and family about it, and they all say I should just let it go and not let her get to me. But it’s really starting to affect my self-esteem and mental health. I feel like I’m constantly on edge whenever I know I might run into her.    I’m at a point where I want to stand up for myself, but I’m not sure how to do it without escalating the situation. I don’t want to make things worse, but I also don’t want to keep feeling this way. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

__label__1 I just finished rewatching the "If You Leave" episode from Degrassi, and I can't help but feel that it was a disservice to Liberty's character. Throughout the series, Liberty has been portrayed as a strong, intelligent, and ambitious young woman, but in this episode, her character felt sidelined and reduced to a plot device.    The way her relationship with J.T. was handled was frustrating. Instead of focusing on her growth and the impact of their relationship, the episode seemed to prioritize shock value over character development. Liberty deserved a more nuanced exploration of her feelings and the consequences of their actions, especially considering how much she had invested in their relationship.    Moreover, the way her character was treated in the aftermath of J.T.'s death was also disappointing. Liberty was left to grapple with her grief in a way that felt rushed and underdeveloped. She had so much potential for a powerful storyline about loss and resilience, but instead, it felt like the writers didn't give her the attention she deserved.    I really wish they had taken the time to give Liberty a more meaningful arc in this episode. She is such a complex character, and it’s a shame that her story was overshadowed by the more sensational aspects of the plot. What do you all think? Did you feel the same way about Liberty's portrayal in this episode?
__label__1 Hey everyone!     I’m a 20-year-old guy looking to connect with someone special. I’ve been on quite a journey of self-discovery and healing over the past few years, and I’d love to share my story with someone who might be going through something similar or just wants to chat about life.    To give you a bit of background, I’ve faced some challenges that really tested my resilience, but I’ve learned a lot about myself in the process. I’ve come to understand the importance of mental health, self-love, and the power of genuine connections. Now, I’m in a much better place and ready to find someone to share my life with.    I’m looking for a meaningful relationship with someone who is open-minded, kind, and ready to embark on this journey together. I enjoy deep conversations, exploring new ideas, and sharing experiences. I’m also a big fan of movies, music, and the occasional video game session.     If you’re interested in getting to know each other, feel free to reach out! I’d love to hear your story and see where things go. Let’s find our way home together!
__label__1 I think we all have that one horror story about forgetting to push code, and I’d love to hear yours! Here’s mine:    A few months ago, I was working on a project with a tight deadline. I had been coding for hours, making significant changes to a critical feature. I was feeling pretty good about my progress and decided to take a break.     When I returned, I realized I had forgotten to push my changes to the remote repository before stepping away. I quickly pushed my code, but when I checked the project’s main branch, I noticed that my changes were not reflected.     Panic set in as I realized that I had been working on a different branch that I had created for testing purposes, and I had completely forgotten to merge it into the main branch. To make matters worse, my teammates had already pulled the latest changes from the main branch and were working on top of it.     I had to scramble to merge my branch, resolve conflicts, and explain to my team why they were seeing errors in their code. It was a stressful few hours, and I learned the hard way the importance of regularly pushing changes and keeping track of which branch I was working on.     Now, I make it a point to push my code frequently and double-check my branch before taking breaks.     What about you? What’s your most horrifying ‘forgot to push’ experience?
__label__1 I've been trying to accept an invitation to a ProtonMail account, but I'm running into some issues. When I click on the invitation link, it takes me to a page that says the invitation is either expired or invalid. I've checked my email and the link is still within the time frame, so I'm not sure what's going wrong.    Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a way to resend the invitation or troubleshoot this issue? I really want to get started with ProtonMail, but this is becoming quite frustrating. Any advice or solutions would be greatly appreciated!

__label__0 Which indie games or "soulslike" recommend me?. Thanks :D
__label__0 Hi all, I am thinking about transferring. I am currently doing a degree in Engineering Technology at a co-op program school, with 2 internships in IT, help desk/admin and wireless analyst. I am in my pre-junior year (3/5 years) with Net+ and Sec+ and Google IT course, 2 Aruba associates certifications.    I am very interested in IT and would love to transfer over. I was wondering how much credits Net+ and Sec+ would cover? Also, I would like a second opinion, if transferring would be worth it? Or should I wait to finish my current degree and then come back to WGU for more schooling.     Based on the Gen Ed, it seems that I’ve taken all courses similar to the ones for WGU, I’ve taken 3 physics classes, business stat, Calc 1-2, Ethics in Engineering and more.    Thank you all for your help!

__label__1 I've been listening to Evanescence a lot lately, and I can't get over Amy Lee's incredible vocal range. From the hauntingly beautiful verses in "My Immortal" to the powerful belts in "Bring Me to Life," she just has this ability to convey so much emotion through her voice.     It's not just about hitting high notes; it's how she transitions between soft, delicate tones and powerful, soaring ones that really captivates me. I love how she can make you feel every word she sings.     What do you all think? Do you have a favorite Amy Lee moment or song that showcases her vocal talent? Let's discuss!
__label__1 I've been using the Spotify integration in Home Assistant for a while now, and it was working perfectly until I updated to version 0.115. Since the update, I can no longer control Spotify through Home Assistant.     I've tried removing and re-adding the integration, but it still doesn't seem to work. The logs don't show any specific errors related to Spotify, but I do notice some warnings about the integration not being able to connect.     Has anyone else experienced this issue after the update? If so, did you find a solution? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm relatively new to YouTube and I'm trying to figure out the best way to grow my channel. I've been posting content consistently for a few months now, but I'm not seeing much growth in terms of subscribers or views.     I focus on gaming content, specifically playthroughs and reviews, but I feel like I'm getting lost in the sea of other creators. I would love to hear any tips or strategies that have worked for you in growing your audience.     Also, if anyone is open to collaborating or sharing feedback on each other's channels, I would be more than happy to connect! Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__0 I decided to seperate from my wife in April after a long history of negativity and anxieties. There were a lot of accusations usually from her to me and paranoia.  I felt like I was controlled and that that standards I was being held to were not replicated. We did councilling but a year later the issues came back and so I couldn't bare it anymore.     Once I pulled the plug I realised how deep and dark her resentment of me went and how much pain and anger she still held on to throughout the marriage. I hoped that she would want to seek councilling again but felt that it shouldn't be for me to take that action as I was the wronged party. Instead of forgiveness or change she seeked to hurt. She took the kids and moved in with her parents and now we look to sell or split everything. Solicitors have been involved for months.     It's now October and we talk very little but I still hold hope in my heart that she's only keeping it going because her friends and family (fueled by her side only) tell her its the only way/best way. I still love her. I have a lot of hurt in my heart and it would take a long time for us to get back to where we once were years ago but I think those years of effort are better than a life time of pain and suffering and loneliness.  I married her because she was the love of my life and it saddens me that everything we once had will be gone forever.  I still refer to her as my wife...before I have to correct myself. I still miss the feel of the ring on my finger even though I'd often not wear it due to it causing a rash. I miss being a family.     Does anyone else feel like this sometimes.
__label__1 Finding an English-speaking job in the Netherlands can vary in difficulty depending on several factors, including your industry, level of experience, and the specific region you are targeting.     In major cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, there are many international companies and startups that operate in English, making it easier to find job opportunities where English is the primary language. Sectors such as technology, finance, and marketing often have a high demand for English-speaking professionals.     However, if you are looking for a job in more traditional sectors or smaller towns, the competition can be tougher, and knowledge of Dutch may be a significant advantage. Many employers still prefer candidates who can communicate in Dutch, especially for roles that involve customer interaction or local market understanding.    Networking can also play a crucial role in your job search. Joining expat groups, attending industry meetups, and utilizing platforms like LinkedIn can help you connect with potential employers and learn about job openings.     Overall, while there are plenty of opportunities for English speakers, being proactive and open to learning some Dutch can greatly enhance your chances of finding a suitable position.
__label__1 I've been using Duolingo to learn French for about a year now, and I have to say, I’m feeling a bit stuck. I’ve completed all the skills in the tree, but I find myself struggling to maintain my motivation. I can read and understand some basic texts, but speaking and writing still feel daunting.    I’ve tried switching things up by using the stories and podcasts, but I still feel like I’m not making significant progress. I’m considering whether I should take a break from Duolingo and try a different method, like language exchange or a formal class.     Has anyone else felt this way? How did you overcome the plateau? Any tips on how to keep the momentum going would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 If you're looking for some hip-hop tracks to chill and relax to, I’ve got a few recommendations that perfectly blend smooth beats with laid-back vibes. Here are some artists and albums that you might want to check out:    1. **Nujabes** - Known for his jazzy instrumentals and mellow beats, Nujabes' music is perfect for unwinding. Check out the album "Modal Soul" for some of his best work.    2. **J Dilla** - His album "Donuts" is a classic and features a variety of beats that are both soothing and intricate. It’s great for background music while you’re just hanging out.    3. **Saba** - His album "Care For Me" has a mix of introspective lyrics and smooth production that can really help you relax and reflect.    4. **Anderson .Paak** - The blend of hip-hop, R&B, and funk in his music makes for a great chill-out session. "Malibu" is a fantastic album to start with.    5. **Mac Miller** - His later work, especially the album "Swimming," has a very calming and introspective feel that’s perfect for winding down.    6. **Isaiah Rashad** - "The Sun's Tirade" features laid-back beats and thoughtful lyrics that create a chill atmosphere.    7. **Mild High Club** - While not strictly hip-hop, their music has a jazzy, chill vibe that pairs well with hip-hop influences. Check out "Timeline" for a unique sound.    What are some of your favorite tracks or artists to chill to? Let’s share some good vibes!
__label__1 I've been diving into the world of battery-operated tools and supplies for our homestead, especially when it comes to caring for our animals. I wanted to share some of the items that have made a significant difference in our daily routines and might be helpful for others in the community.    1. **Electric Fencing**: We invested in a battery-operated electric fence system to keep our chickens safe from predators. It’s portable and easy to set up, which is perfect for rotating our grazing areas. The peace of mind it provides is invaluable!    2. **Automatic Waterers**: We found a battery-powered automatic waterer that keeps our chickens and goats hydrated without needing to refill constantly. It’s been a game changer, especially during the hot summer months when we’re busy with other tasks.    3. **Portable Solar-Powered Fans**: For our barn, we’ve set up a couple of battery-operated fans that can be charged with solar panels. They help keep the air circulating during the hotter days, which is crucial for the health of our animals.    4. **LED Headlamps**: When it comes to evening chores, having a good battery-operated headlamp has been a lifesaver. It allows us to tend to the animals and check on everything without fumbling around with flashlights.    5. **Battery-Powered Clippers**: We use battery-operated clippers for grooming our goats and sheep. They’re lightweight and easy to maneuver, making the grooming process much smoother and less stressful for the animals.    6. **Portable Battery-Powered Sprayers**: For those who are into organic gardening and pest control, a battery-operated sprayer can be a great asset. We use it to apply natural pest deterrents around the homestead without the hassle of manual pumping.    These tools have not only made our lives easier but have also improved the overall care we provide to our animals. I’d love to hear if anyone else has found other battery-operated supplies that have made a difference in their homesteading journey!
__label__1 I wanted to reach out and get some advice from you all. I'm in my late 20s and I've been feeling a bit lost in terms of my career path. I graduated a few years ago and have been working in a job that pays the bills, but I don't find it fulfilling at all. I often hear people talk about finding their passion or purpose, but I’m not sure what mine is.     How did you guys figure out what you wanted to do? Did you have any specific experiences or moments that helped you clarify your goals? Any tips on how to explore different career options or find something that truly excites you? I’d really appreciate any insights or stories you can share!
__label__1 I've been having a frustrating time with my headset on Xbox One lately. It seems like every time I try to use it, I either get no sound or the mic doesn't work properly. I've tried all the usual fixes: checking the connections, updating the controller, and even resetting my console, but nothing seems to help.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? If so, what solutions have you found that actually work? I'm really tired of missing out on game chat and not being able to communicate with my friends during multiplayer sessions. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’m just a few weeks post-op from my gastric sleeve surgery, and I’ve been trying to figure out my caffeine intake. I’ve read mixed opinions on whether caffeine is okay after surgery, especially since it can be dehydrating and might irritate the stomach.     I came across a recommendation that 22mg of caffeine is generally considered a low amount. For reference, that’s about the amount in a small cup of green tea. I’m curious if anyone else has had experience with this amount of caffeine post-op. Did you find it affected your recovery or hydration levels?     I want to be cautious and make sure I’m not doing anything that could hinder my healing process, but I also miss my morning routine of having a warm drink. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__0 I'm a pediatric oncology clinical pharmacist and one of my favorite patients with bone cancer is finishing the last of her chemo. She's planning to start taking college classes this Fall and I'm so happy for her.     She has a denim jacket that she's asked her caregivers to write notes on the inside with Sharpie. She plans to also add patches to the outside of the jacket.      I do a ton of hand embroidery and I want to embroider a patch for her but I have an underdeveloped creative side. So I thought I'd ask this amazing community for ideas.     She already has something with the golden ribbon and something that says "Cancer Sucks." I was thinking of something like "Kicking Cancer's Butt since \[year of diagnosis\]"     Would love any ideas you can share! I'll post a picture of the final product when I've finished it. I have a little less than 2 weeks to make it. Thanks!    PS - yes I know we're not supposed to have favorites, but sometimes there are patients who just stand out and favorite seems like the right word to describe them.
__label__1 I recently noticed some issues with my lawn and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community. I have a mix of Kentucky Bluegrass and Perennial Ryegrass in my yard, and I've been trying to keep it healthy. However, I've started to see some yellowing and thinning patches, especially in areas that get a lot of sun.    I water regularly, but I’m not sure if I’m over or under-watering. I also applied a nitrogen-rich fertilizer about a month ago, but I’m concerned that it might have been too much.     Additionally, I’ve spotted some small brown spots that look like they might be fungal issues. I’ve attached some pictures for reference.     Any advice on how to diagnose the problem and what steps I should take to revive my lawn would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I'm on the hunt for contemporary mysteries, thrillers, crime, and suspense novels that are so gripping I won't be able to put them down. I love stories with unexpected twists, complex characters, and a plot that keeps me guessing until the very end.     Some of my recent favorites include "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins and "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides. I enjoy both psychological thrillers and classic whodunits, so I'm open to any recommendations that fit the bill.     If you have any titles that you think are absolute page-turners, please share! I'm eager to dive into some new reads.

__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm looking for some recommendations on video stabilization software. I've been doing a lot of filming lately, and I've noticed that some of my footage is a bit shaky. I want to improve the quality of my videos, and stabilization is a key part of that.     I've heard of a few options like Adobe Premiere Pro's Warp Stabilizer and Final Cut Pro's stabilization feature, but I'm curious if there are any other tools out there that you all have found effective.     I'm open to both paid and free options, and I'd love to hear about your experiences with them. What do you use, and how easy is it to integrate into your workflow? Thanks in advance for your help!
__label__1 I found this interesting rock while hiking in a local park. It has a smooth, shiny surface and a unique pattern that looks almost like a natural mosaic. The colors range from deep green to light gray, with some areas that have a slight shimmer. It’s about the size of a fist and feels quite heavy for its size. I’m curious if anyone can help identify what type of rock this might be. Thanks in advance for your help!    ![Rock Image](https://example.com/rock_image.jpg)

__label__1 I have a few questions about connecting flights in Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and I hope someone here can help me out.     I have a layover in Philadelphia for about 2 hours before my next flight, and I’m a bit anxious about the whole process.     1. **Terminal Transfers**: I’ve heard that American Airlines operates out of multiple terminals at PHL. How do I know if I need to transfer terminals for my connecting flight? Is it easy to navigate between terminals?     2. **Security Check**: Will I have to go through security again if I’m connecting to another American Airlines flight? I’ve read mixed things about this, and I want to be prepared.     3. **Time Management**: Is 2 hours enough time to make my connection, considering potential delays? I’ve heard that PHL can be busy, especially during peak travel times.     4. **Baggage**: If I checked my bags in at my departure airport, will they automatically transfer to my connecting flight, or do I need to pick them up and re-check them?     5. **Food Options**: Lastly, if I have some time to spare, what are some good food options in the airport? I’d love to grab a bite while I wait.     Thanks in advance for any advice or tips you can share! I really appreciate it.
__label__1 It’s becoming increasingly clear that the producers are using the Kathy Hilton drama as a distraction from Erika Jayne’s ongoing legal issues and questionable behavior. I mean, every time Erika is about to face some serious scrutiny, suddenly there’s a new twist in the Kathy storyline.     Last week, we had the infamous Aspen trip where Kathy allegedly had a meltdown, and now it feels like that’s all anyone can talk about. Meanwhile, Erika is still dealing with the fallout from her divorce and the lawsuits, but it’s like the focus has shifted entirely.     I can’t help but wonder if this is all a strategic move to keep the audience engaged and to protect Erika from the backlash she would otherwise face. It’s almost like they’re saying, "Look over here at Kathy!" while Erika continues to navigate her mess.     What do you all think? Are the producers intentionally diverting our attention, or is it just a coincidence that the drama seems to align so perfectly? Let’s discuss!

__label__1 I’ve been playing with a sim for a while now, and I’ve decided that I want to change their sexuality. I know that in The Sims 4, you can set a sim's sexual orientation when you create them, but is there a way to change it after they’ve already been created?     I want to explore different romantic options for my sim, but I’m not sure how to go about it without starting a whole new game. I’ve heard that there are some cheats or mods that can help with this, but I’d prefer to keep it vanilla if possible.     Any tips or suggestions on how to change my sim's sexuality in-game? Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, especially with the show coming to an end. For me, Season 5 really stands out. The tension between Jimmy and Kim, the introduction of Lalo Salamanca, and the way the stakes were raised with the whole Mesa Verde situation made it incredibly gripping. Plus, the character development for both Jimmy and Saul was at its peak.     I loved how we saw Jimmy really start to embrace his darker side, while Kim was trying to hold onto her moral compass. The finale of that season, with the cliffhanger of the shootout, left me on the edge of my seat!     What about everyone else? Do you prefer the earlier seasons when things were more light-hearted, or do you think the later seasons, with all their intensity and drama, are better? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I recently stumbled upon some of the most hilarious IMDb reviews while looking up movies for a movie night. It's amazing how people can be so passionate about their opinions, whether they loved or absolutely hated a film.     One review I read for a well-known blockbuster was just a single line: "This movie was like a bad date that lasted three hours." I couldn't stop laughing!     Another one for a classic film said, "If I wanted to watch paint dry, I would have just stayed home and watched my walls."     It’s fascinating to see how creative and funny some people can be when expressing their thoughts. It makes me wonder if anyone else has come across some gems in the IMDb review section. What’s the funniest or most outrageous review you’ve seen? Let’s share some laughs!
__label__0 I used the virtual VERA appointment link and scheduled for the following day.     She called me at our appointment time and was so polite and helpful.     She was able to tell me that on Aug 10th I will be assigned to a rater and that if there is no updates (moved to PFN) online within 2 weeks after Aug 10th, to schedule another appt with them so they can follow up.     Just knowing that, allows me to stop checking the VA app 10 times a day. :) I highly recommend scheduling with VERA for an update!

__label__1 If the zombie apocalypse were to occur, I think I would prefer to survive on a submarine rather than a cruise ship. Here’s why:    1. **Isolation and Security**: A submarine is designed to be submerged and can operate underwater, which provides a significant advantage in terms of avoiding zombies. The cruise ship, while large and potentially defensible, would be more vulnerable to boarding and attacks, especially if it’s anchored or near land.    2. **Limited Access Points**: Submarines have fewer access points compared to a cruise ship. This means that it would be easier to secure and defend against any potential threats. On a cruise ship, there are multiple decks and open areas that could be exploited by zombies or hostile survivors.    3. **Resource Management**: Submarines are equipped with systems for recycling air and water, which could be crucial for long-term survival. While a cruise ship has amenities and food supplies, it would eventually run out, and resupplying would be risky. A submarine’s ability to stay submerged for extended periods could allow for better resource management.    4. **Mobility**: A submarine can travel to different locations without being detected, allowing for the possibility of finding safer areas or resources. A cruise ship, on the other hand, would be limited to the surface and could easily attract unwanted attention.    5. **Crew Training**: Submarines are typically operated by trained personnel, which means that if I were on a submarine, I might have access to individuals with skills in navigation, engineering, and survival tactics that could be beneficial in a crisis.    Of course, there are challenges with both options, such as the claustrophobia of a submarine or the potential for a cruise ship to become a floating death trap. But overall, I think the advantages of a submarine in a zombie apocalypse scenario would outweigh those of a cruise ship. What about you? Would you choose one over the other?
__label__1 I'm currently working with Kibana and Elasticsearch, and I need to create an API key for a user from the Superuser role. I understand that API keys are a way to authenticate requests to the Elasticsearch cluster, but I'm not entirely sure how to generate one specifically for a user from the Kibana interface.    Can anyone provide a step-by-step guide on how to create an API key for a user in Kibana? Additionally, are there any permissions or settings I need to be aware of to ensure that the API key works correctly for the intended user?     Any insights or references to the official documentation would be greatly appreciated!

I was playing a match the other day, and I was just about to take the lead when my opponent, using a character I thought I had a good handle on, pulled off a perfectly timed spike. I went from feeling confident to absolutely furious in a split second.     I started looking into why this happens, and it turns out that our brains release a rush of adrenaline and cortisol when we experience sudden frustration or anger. This is why we sometimes feel like throwing our controllers or yelling at the screen.     I mean, it’s just a game, right? But in that moment, it feels like the end of the world! I’ve seen people rage quit, throw their controllers, or even break their consoles over a single match. It’s wild how invested we get in these characters and matches.     So, what’s your worst rage moment in Smash? Did you ever break something or say something you regretted? Let’s share our stories of rage and maybe find some humor in it!
__label__1 The unification of Russia is a fascinating topic within the TNO mod, especially considering the various paths and outcomes that can arise from it. The potential for a unified Russia to emerge from the chaos of the post-war period opens up numerous gameplay possibilities and narrative threads.     One of the most intriguing aspects is how different factions and leaders can influence the unification process. For instance, the struggle between the various warlords and political factions can lead to unique alliances or betrayals, shaping the future of the nation. The mod does a great job of capturing the complexity of Russian politics during this time, and the decisions players make can lead to vastly different scenarios.    Additionally, the cultural and ethnic diversity within Russia adds another layer of depth to the unification process. How will the new government address the needs and aspirations of various ethnic groups? Will it lead to a more centralized state, or will regional identities be preserved?    I also appreciate the historical references and alternate history elements that the mod incorporates. It’s fascinating to see how real historical events are reimagined in the context of a fractured Russia trying to find its footing again.     What are your thoughts on the unification paths? Do you prefer a more authoritarian approach, or do you think a democratic transition is more fitting for Russia's future? Let’s discuss the various outcomes and the implications they have for the gameplay experience!
__label__0 It appears that the Ring Android App v3.30.0 is using a lot of battery. I have only had my Ring Doorbell 3 Plus for a week so cannot compare with older versions of the app.    Checking the battery usage stats in Settings, the Ring app is by far the most battery hungry app I have (currently being responsible for over 40% of the total % of battery used).    Does anyone have any solutions or hints and tips for reducing the battery use? Is it worthwhile setting the app to restricted background use or will this affect notifications etc?     My device is Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro running MIUI 11.0.4 based on Android 10.  Thanks.

__label__1 When it comes to protein intake, it really depends on your individual goals, activity level, and body weight. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine how much protein you should be consuming:    1. **General Recommendations**: For the average adult, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This means if you weigh 70 kg (about 154 lbs), you should aim for around 56 grams of protein per day.    2. **For Active Individuals**: If you’re regularly working out or trying to build muscle, you might want to increase your protein intake. Many fitness experts recommend between 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, depending on the intensity of your workouts. For example, if you’re a serious athlete, you might aim for the higher end of that range.    3. **For Weight Loss**: If you’re trying to lose weight, increasing your protein intake can help you feel fuller for longer and preserve muscle mass while losing fat. Aiming for around 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight can be beneficial.    4. **Protein Sources**: Make sure to include a variety of protein sources in your diet. This can include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, focus on plant-based proteins like lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, and tofu.    5. **Listen to Your Body**: Ultimately, it’s important to listen to your body and adjust your protein intake based on how you feel and your performance in the gym. If you’re feeling fatigued or not recovering well, you might need to reassess your protein consumption.    Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and goals. Happy lifting!
__label__1 Hey Onewheel fam!      I’m looking to upgrade my ride with a float plate and would love to hear your recommendations. I’ve been riding my Onewheel for a while now and I’m ready to take it to the next level with some added protection and style.      What float plates have you guys had the best experience with? Are there any specific brands or models that you swear by? I’m particularly interested in durability and how they affect the ride feel.      Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
__label__0 Is there any possibility to automate WordPress posting from google sheets? I have seen and zappier and others are providing this service but they provide limited fields for posting like title, and content I need to automate posting on SEO Yoast setting also. Is there any option available for that?
__label__1 I've been experimenting with the deckbuilder in Magic Arena and noticed the "non-collected" filter. When I enable it, I see a list of cards that I don't own. However, I'm curious if this list is exhaustive or if there are additional cards that I might be missing that don't show up in that filter.     For example, if a new set is released, will all the non-collected cards from that set appear immediately, or could there be some that are not yet included in the filter? Has anyone else noticed any discrepancies or have insights on how this feature works? Would love to hear your thoughts!

__label__1 I just had the best experience with Instacart today! I was assigned a batch that was a little on the larger side, with 30 items and a decent distance to cover. I was honestly a bit nervous because I’ve had some rough batches lately, but this one turned out to be a breeze.    The store was well-stocked, and I found everything without any issues. The customer had even taken the time to leave clear notes about substitutions, which made my job so much easier. I was able to complete the shopping in record time, and the delivery went smoothly as well.     To top it all off, the customer left a generous tip! It’s nice to see that some customers really appreciate the work we do. I know we often share the tough experiences, but I wanted to take a moment to celebrate a good one. Here’s hoping for more batches like this in the future! How has everyone else’s day been?
__label__0 I got this e-mail today from a company called **Hatchways.**    They seem to offer a nice service to help devs to get a job.

__label__1 KSI has been making waves in the boxing world, and I think it would be epic if he fought a pro boxer first before taking on Swarmz. Imagine the hype! He could have a solid hour break in between to recover and strategize. This way, he gets to test his skills against a seasoned fighter, and then he can switch gears to face Swarmz, who has a different style altogether. It would be a true test of his versatility and stamina. Plus, it would give fans two exciting fights in one night! What do you all think? Would you want to see KSI take on a pro boxer first?
__label__1 I’ve been married to my husband for three years, and I’m starting to feel uneasy about some of his behaviors. I’ve never been in an abusive relationship before, but I’ve heard stories from friends and read about red flags. I’m worried that I might be missing something or overthinking things.     Here are some things that have been bothering me:    1. **Controlling Behavior**: He often wants to know where I am and who I’m with, even when I’m just out with friends. At first, I thought it was sweet that he cared, but now it feels suffocating. He gets upset if I don’t check in regularly.    2. **Criticism**: He makes comments about my appearance and choices, often framing them as jokes. For example, he’ll say things like, "You’d look better if you wore this instead" or "Why do you want to do that? It’s not really your thing." I brush it off, but it’s starting to wear on me.    3. **Isolation**: I’ve noticed that he doesn’t like me spending time with certain friends, claiming they’re a bad influence. I’ve started to see less of them, and I feel guilty about it, but I also miss them.    4. **Mood Swings**: His mood can change quickly. One moment he’s affectionate and loving, and the next, he’s distant or irritable. I find myself walking on eggshells, trying to avoid triggering a bad mood.    5. **Gaslighting**: Sometimes, he’ll deny things he said or did, making me question my memory. For instance, he’ll insist he never said something that I clearly remember. It leaves me feeling confused and doubting myself.    I’m not sure if these behaviors are just quirks of his personality or if they’re signs of something more serious. I want to trust my instincts, but I also don’t want to jump to conclusions without solid evidence.     For those who have been in abusive relationships, what were the red flags you missed? How did you recognize them? I’m looking for any advice or insights that could help me figure out if I’m overreacting or if I need to take these concerns seriously.
__label__0 We are both 21 on an early relationship (2 months), he left town temporarily due to college. I’m visiting him at the city next week, and asked me if I can bring some food his mom is sending for him. I’m glad to finally meet his mom, but I’m just his friend to her.    It bothers me that all of my family knows that he’s my bf, including my mom, but no one in his family knows he’s gay and on a relationship with me. I feel like he’s not giving me the position I deserve. I don’t want to be hid away.    I’ve been telling him those things, but he’s just afraid of his mom knowing it. Trying too hard to understand his situation, but I don’t know if I’m able to stay if this continues.    Should I come up with this situation to him? Should I give an ultimatum? I’m trying my best to don’t be nagging but understanding instead, but this is way too much    We are both grown up adults and shouldn’t hide who we love.    Thx for reading ppl. ❤️

__label__0 Omg please just say something if I don't notice you ITS NOT THAT HARD, customers are always just standing there with clothes at the fitting rooms and not saying anything, I don't always notice their there, if they would just get my attention right then, they would't  have to wait, also it's so freaking creepy, sometimes I turn around and their standing right behind me and scare the crap out of me, WHY WON'T THEY JUST FREAKING TALK, SERIOUSLY
__label__0 My SysOps Admin exam is today. Or so I thought, got a text yesterday at 2:30 saying I missed my 1 PM slot but they still had room for me. Can't reschedule exams within 24 hrs, so...I drove over, stressed out and not in a good mental space.    Took the full 3 hours because I had issues with two of the labs. I blew the last one on something I knew I needed to do (and could do) but hadn't done before. Couldn't find the toggle for it! But...    I found out this morning I passed by 15 points. I know folks ask about the time to find out the score report. I finished my exam at 6PM ET last night and got my score report/Credly email at 5:30 AM ET, so less than 12 hours.    The three labs were covering AWS Backups, Cloudformation, and S3/Route Route53.    The study material I used was ExamPro's Course and the Tutorial Dojo practice tests. This was a pretty challenging exam on top of my scheduling induced last minute stress bomb. I don't have any operational AWS experience (but I am an network/cybersecurity architect w/ 19 yrs experience), so I imagine those with a few years of hands on AWS work probably would find it a bit easier (but not easy). I'm doing this as a progression step for the Advanced Networking Specialty. I also recently passed the CCSP, so it was interesting to contrast the difficulty for both of these.    I'll be dropping an in-depth review video next week on my YouTube if you want to check it out, youtube.com/c/cyberinsight

__label__1 I've been thinking about the challenges we face in life, and I wanted to get your opinions on which of the following tasks you think is harder.     1. **Learning a new language** - It requires time, dedication, and often a lot of practice to become fluent.  2. **Running a marathon** - Training for a marathon takes physical endurance, mental strength, and a significant time commitment.  3. **Starting a business** - This involves not only a financial risk but also the stress of managing everything from marketing to customer service.  4. **Writing a book** - Crafting a coherent narrative or argument can be a daunting task that requires creativity and discipline.    So, which of these do you think is the hardest? Vote in the poll and feel free to share your thoughts in the comments!     [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/xyz123)

__label__1 1. "Forgot About Dre" - Dr. Dre ft. Eminem    2. "Renegade" - Jay-Z ft. Eminem    3. "The Monster" - Eminem ft. Rihanna    4. "Sicko Mode" - Travis Scott ft. Eminem (remix)    5. "Kings Never Die" - Eminem ft. Gwen Stefani      Each of these tracks showcases Eminem's incredible lyrical ability and unique flow, but I want to know which one you think stands out the most. Is it the classic vibe of "Forgot About Dre," the intense back-and-forth in "Renegade," or the powerful anthem of "The Monster"? Let’s discuss! What makes your pick the best collab?
__label__1 In a situation where someone finds themselves naked in public, it seems that covering your face might be more socially acceptable than covering your genitals. This is because, in many cultures, the face is associated with identity and personal connection, while genitals are often viewed as private and shameful. Covering your face could lead to a more empathetic response from onlookers, as they might see you as a person in distress rather than just a naked body. It's interesting how our societal norms dictate what we prioritize in terms of modesty and vulnerability.
__label__1 I’m currently working at a hospital in NYC and I’m trying to navigate my work schedule in relation to Shabbat. As a practicing Jew, it’s really important for me to observe Shabbat properly, but my shifts can be unpredictable and often include weekends.     I’ve spoken to my supervisor about my need to have Fridays off to prepare for Shabbat, but I’m not sure how to approach this in a way that is respectful and also ensures I can maintain my job.     Has anyone else had experience balancing a demanding job in healthcare with Shabbat observance? What strategies have you found helpful? Are there specific rights or accommodations I should be aware of when discussing this with my employer?     I appreciate any advice or personal experiences you can share!
__label__1 Has anyone else experienced the chaos that is Exit 12 B on 280 for the Garden State Parkway North? It feels like a game of Frogger every time I try to navigate that exit. The merging traffic is relentless, and the signage is confusing at best.     I’ve seen so many near-misses and it seems like every time I’m there, someone is honking or yelling. It’s especially bad during rush hour when everyone is trying to get to work or home.     Is there a better way to handle this exit? Are there any tips for making it through without losing your mind? Or is it just one of those things we have to accept as part of driving in New Jersey?     Let’s commiserate about this traffic nightmare!
__label__0 I (14/F, 5’0 and 91 pounds) have been having difficulties with eating. It’s come to the point where I don’t have an appetite or feel hungry. Eating food and swallowing is hard for me, but manageable. When I do finally eat I get really full, or I feel some sort of discomfort in my abdomen.     Now, possibly due to the fact I don’t eat a lot, I get dizzy when I stand up. Like, when I walk my vision gets a bit distorted (It’s like i’m seeing noise and blacking out a little). This has happened to me many times, once so severe that I had to stay in bed and I could stand up or eat food (My mom was aware but didn’t let me go to the doctor.)    I also forget to drink water  What i wanted to ask was what is happening with my body? I don’t like being unsure and i’ve been stressing about this a lot lately
__label__0 Basically the title. I'm new to the tcg and got a Dracovish V card out of the Deck Builder Kit. I think it's really great and plan to start building a deck around it, but I'm a little afraid of dropping to much money on configuring a deck if there's going to be a whole new set of opportunities for power creep in only a couple months. How cemented is the V mechanic? is Dracovish likely to fall off?
__label__0 Life is getting overwhelming, feels like a lot of things are going on at the same time, and I need to start being an adult. I haven't used my teen years well. Ive mostly just been depressed, doing stuff that I shouldn't or ruining my chances at something. It's always been this constant "being late for something", like how if I did a thing 2 days ago, I would've gotten paid 100€, or how if I applied for this job a week ago I would've gotten in, but now they hired this new person because they applied before me. Job's are horrible to me, over 20+ resumes over the summer, for full time. I live in Spain, the summer gets very busy with tourists, so they need the people. I got no calls, no texts, no emails. I don't know where else to look for a job, and now I can't full time since I'm studying, although I want to stop studying this career and go get a job asap, to pay for my own stuff and move out asap as well. Im 19 now and the amount of things that I know now that I didn't before is immense, like how I never knew that my mother had an illness that makes her forget things, how she doesn't remember last year's Christmas for example, or how she doesn't remember discussing with me a trip to see my friends. How I see myself reflected on my nephew in every aspect, how I realize my body getting weaker and weaker, realizing what happens around me, and on the street, seeing my friends struggle with money themselves, or be in a toxic relationship that I'm too scared to get involved in, because they're both my friends since I was a wee kid. Now my boyfriend doesn't want to move in with me and instead of going to live to Germany in a few years he wants to go live in Mexico, which I don't want to so we'll have to break up because of that, so I'll just have to live alone in a foreign country. I just don't want anything like this to happen. I want to be a kid again. I want to be asking my sister to play mario kart with me again, eat a bag of chips and not be worried about my health, I want to not feel horrible for my family everytime they see me smoking, I want to get the thought of "maybe I should do drugs" out of my head, I want it all to stop. But since I can there's nothing I can do than just keep going.
__label__1 I’m looking for some book recommendations as I’m not really used to reading. I’ve always found it hard to get into books, but I want to change that. I’m open to any genre, but I think I might enjoy something that’s engaging and not too dense. I’ve heard that graphic novels or short stories can be a good starting point for new readers.     If you have any suggestions for books that are easy to read and captivating, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks!

__label__1 I've been having a frustrating issue with my Xbox controller not connecting to my console. I've already replaced the batteries, so I know that's not the problem. I've tried turning the console off and on, as well as resetting the controller by holding the sync button, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any other troubleshooting steps I can try? I really want to get back to gaming without having to buy a new controller. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 Hey everyone!      I'm running for head boy this year, and I could really use some advice on how to make my campaign stand out. I want to connect with my fellow students and show them why I would be a great choice for this role.      Here are a few ideas I have so far:    1. **Create a catchy slogan** - Something memorable that reflects my vision for the school.    2. **Engage with students** - I plan to set up a booth during lunch to talk to students and hear their concerns.    3. **Social media presence** - I want to use platforms like Instagram and TikTok to share my ideas and connect with students.    4. **Fun campaign materials** - Maybe some posters or flyers that are visually appealing and informative.      What do you think? Any tips on what worked for you in your campaigns or any creative ideas I might be missing? Thanks in advance for your help!

__label__0 I see posts about how mistreating others (especially waitstaff etc), avoiding accountability + never apologizing, being unfaithful, mirroring, &amp; a lack of empathy are incredibly common.     My therapist cautioned me the other day about my partner being a narcissist, &amp; I find refuge in these posts so often, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had the experience I have.     -He is so, so nice to waitstaff &amp; servers etc. He calls everyone by name &amp; makes little jokes &amp; puts on his cute, charming little show to everyone all the time.     -My partner demonstrates SO much empathetic behavior to the point of righteousness sometimes.     -He is quick to apologize any time I am hurt &amp; sometimes the intensity of his apologies make me uncomfortable (esp bc he says I am absolutely horrible at apologizing &amp; I never validate his feelings when he’s hurt &amp; he always does mine).     -Rather than mirroring, he is CONSTANTLY talking about the things he’s interested in like they’re the most important things in the world &amp; we mostly listen to his music, watch what he likes, talk about his interests, &amp; dive into his thoughts. Sometimes for literal hours on end.     -He has a bunch of friends &amp; goes out of his way to text all of the girls before he hangs out with them that he knows guys can be creepy sometimes &amp; he wants them to feel comfortable &amp; safe etc &amp; just wants to hang.     But I also sense that this behavior might be manipulative or controlling in its own way, too. I’m *always* always doing something wrong. I’m always hurting his feelings. I’m always not seeing him or considering him &amp; I’m careless with him. I *always* have something to apologize for. Nobody else is as nice or caring as he is &amp; he’s the only one he knows who actually knows how to treat people. But he’s yelled at me, blocked me, left me in the middle of the night, said belittling things about me &amp; my behavior, etc. all in the name of “keeping himself safe” because I trigger him &amp; am inconsiderate &amp; he can’t be around it.     Does this resonate with anyone else?
__label__0 Hi All,    My scenario:     1. I bought a house along with my wife that is with about 105,000 at a 4% interest rate. We still owe about 95,000 on the house. This comes with a 70/mo PMI and the interest rate of course.    We are hoping to do 2 things:      1. Refinance to remove PMI   2. Add wife as co-signer/owner of the home mortgage.     I have started some of this process by contacting the mortgage company. It looks like we may have to wait until we get to the 80% value to remove PMI, but was still hoping refi would drop the interest rates down.      Any advice?
__label__1 With the release of next-generation consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X, I've been wondering if they will finally address the texture and object pop-in issues that have plagued games, especially in titles like Call of Duty.     On PC, we often have the option to tweak settings to minimize these issues, but it seems like even with high-end hardware, pop-in can still be a problem in some games. The new consoles are equipped with faster SSDs and improved hardware, which should theoretically reduce loading times and improve streaming of textures and objects in real-time.     Do you think that developers will take full advantage of these advancements to create a smoother experience, or will we still see these issues persist? I’m curious to hear what everyone thinks about the future of gaming on both consoles and PC, especially in relation to the Call of Duty franchise. Will the next-gen consoles set a new standard that PC games will have to follow, or will they continue to lag behind in terms of optimization?

__label__1 Great Britain is currently going through a lot of changes and challenges, and it can be a bit confusing! Here’s a simple breakdown:    1. **Politics**: The UK has been dealing with political changes, especially after Brexit, which is when they decided to leave the European Union (EU). This decision has led to discussions about trade, laws, and how they interact with other countries. Some people are happy about it, while others are worried about the consequences.    2. **Economy**: The economy is like a big machine that helps people buy and sell things. Right now, the UK is facing some economic challenges, like rising prices (inflation) and changes in jobs. This means that people are paying more for things like food and energy, which can make it harder for families to manage their budgets.    3. **Health**: The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a big impact. While things are getting better, there are still discussions about healthcare and how to prepare for future health crises. The National Health Service (NHS) is very important in the UK, and people are concerned about its funding and resources.    4. **Social Issues**: There are ongoing conversations about social issues, like equality and climate change. Many people are advocating for better treatment of different groups and for taking care of the environment.    5. **Royal Family**: The royal family is also in the news a lot. With changes in leadership and public interest, people are curious about their role in modern society.    In summary, Great Britain is navigating through political, economic, health, and social changes, which can be a lot to keep track of! It's like a big puzzle where all the pieces are shifting and people are trying to figure out how they fit together.
__label__1 If there were an impending Earth-ending event, I think I would want to know about it, but with some caveats. On one hand, having that knowledge could allow me to spend my final days with loved ones, say goodbye, and perhaps even find some peace in the face of the inevitable. I could also use that time to reflect on my life, make amends, or even try to accomplish some bucket list items that I’ve been putting off.    On the other hand, knowing about such a catastrophic event could lead to widespread panic and chaos. It might be difficult to enjoy those last moments if everyone around me is in a state of fear and despair. Plus, there’s the question of whether or not I would be able to do anything meaningful with that information. If there’s no way to prevent the event, would knowing just add to the anxiety?    Ultimately, I think I would prefer to know, but I would hope that there would be some sort of support system in place to help people cope with the news. How about you? Would you want to know if the end was near?
__label__1 I've been thinking about Vantage's passive ability, Spotter's Lens, and I can't help but wonder if it was originally intended for Pathfinder's rework instead.     Pathfinder has always been a fan favorite, but his passive, Insider Knowledge, has felt a bit lackluster compared to other legends. Vantage's ability to mark enemies and provide valuable intel seems like it could have been a perfect fit for Pathfinder, especially considering his role as a scout.     Imagine if Pathfinder had the ability to highlight enemies from a distance, giving him a unique edge in gathering information for his team. It would have added a new layer to his gameplay, making him not just a mobility legend but also a crucial part of the team's strategy.     With the recent changes to the game and the introduction of new legends, it’s possible that the developers decided to pivot Vantage's abilities to create a fresh character rather than rework Pathfinder.     What do you all think? Could Vantage's passive have been a missed opportunity for Pathfinder, or do you believe it fits her character better? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been doing some reading and talking to friends, and I've come across the idea that erection size can change over time. I'm in my late 30s, and while I haven't noticed a significant change, I've heard from some guys that they feel their erections aren't as firm or as large as they used to be.     Is this something that happens to most men as they age? Are there specific factors that can contribute to a decrease in erection size, like stress, health issues, or lifestyle choices?     Also, if anyone has experienced this, what steps did you take to address it? Did you find any effective solutions or treatments? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences.
__label__0 (not a native speaker sorry) I'm entering my 7th semester of college where i'm studying electrical engineering and i worry that i'm way to dumb to be doing this. I'm not a slacker, actually i'm very much a dedicated person, that i know for sure. I always try my hardest when studying, others even take note of that, but it doesn't seem like it's enough. All of my grades range from mediocre to insuficient, no matter how hard i try. I know i shouldn't be comparing myself to others but i'm surrounded by such smart people that effortless make trough asignments, compared to them i'm nothing. I've spoken about this with professors and friends and they all say that the problem lies within my anxiety, i get so nervous during tests that my mind will go blank all the time. But i can't shake the feeling that maybe i'm just too dumb and mentally uncapable of doing this. I like this course and don't see myself studying anything else so thats troubling.
__label__1 Hey everyone,    I hope you’re all doing well. I’m a former sailor who spent a few years on active duty and, to be honest, I’ve been feeling a strong pull to return. I know it sounds a bit crazy, but I actually miss the structure, the camaraderie, and yes, even the misery that comes with military life.     I’ve been out for a couple of years now, and I’m wondering what the process looks like for re-enlisting. Are there any specific challenges I should be aware of? I’ve heard that the military has changed quite a bit since I left, and I want to make sure I’m prepared for whatever comes my way.     Also, if anyone has tips on how to mentally prepare for the transition back, I’d really appreciate it. I remember the first time I joined, I was filled with excitement and nerves, but this time feels different.     Thanks in advance for any advice or insights you can share!     Fair winds and following seas!

__label__1 I've been experiencing some issues with xCloud lately and wanted to see if anyone else is having similar problems. Specifically, I've noticed frequent disconnections during gameplay, especially when playing more demanding titles like Forza Horizon 5. My internet connection is stable, and I have a decent speed (around 200 Mbps), but it seems like the streaming quality fluctuates a lot, leading to lag and pixelation.    I usually play on my PC using the Edge browser, but I've also tried the mobile app on my iPhone, and the experience is hit or miss. Sometimes it runs smoothly, but other times, it feels like I'm playing in slow motion.     Has anyone found any solutions or tips to improve the performance? Or is this just a common issue with xCloud at the moment? Would love to hear your experiences!
__label__1 I've been dealing with some emotional stress lately, and I've noticed that crying has left my skin feeling really dry and irritated. I usually have combination skin, but after crying, the areas around my eyes and cheeks become flaky and tight.     I’ve tried using my regular moisturizer, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I’m wondering if anyone has tips or products that can help soothe and hydrate my skin after crying.     Should I be using a specific type of moisturizer or maybe a hydrating serum? Also, are there any gentle cleansers that won’t strip my skin further? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been thinking about the idea of banning omni-food in my living space, and I wanted to get some thoughts from the community.     As a vegan, I feel strongly about my dietary choices and the ethical implications behind them. However, I live with non-vegan roommates who often bring home meat and dairy products. The smell and presence of these foods can be quite triggering for me, and I find it difficult to maintain my commitment to veganism in an environment where animal products are constantly around.     I’m considering having a conversation with my roommates about creating a vegan-only zone in our shared kitchen or even banning omni-food entirely from our living spaces. I want to approach this in a way that respects their choices while also standing firm in my beliefs.     Have any of you faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? What are some tips for having this conversation without causing conflict? I’d love to hear your experiences and advice!
__label__1 Mastering every weapon in Doom Eternal's campaign without replaying missions can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible with the right approach. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:    1. **Utilize the Weapon Wheel**: Make sure to switch between weapons frequently during combat. Each weapon has its own unique mastery challenges, so using them in various situations will help you progress faster.    2. **Focus on Weaknesses**: Each enemy type has specific weaknesses to certain weapons. For example, using the Plasma Rifle against shielded enemies or the Shotgun against armored foes can help you complete weapon challenges more efficiently.    3. **Use the Codex**: The in-game codex provides information on enemy weaknesses and weapon effectiveness. Familiarizing yourself with this can help you choose the right weapon for the right enemy, speeding up your mastery.    4. **Experiment with Mods**: Each weapon has different mods that can change how they perform. Experimenting with these mods can help you find the most effective ways to deal damage and complete challenges.    5. **Play on Higher Difficulties**: If you're comfortable, playing on higher difficulties can yield more opportunities to use your weapons effectively, as enemies will be tougher and require more strategic use of your arsenal.    6. **Use the Cheat Codes**: If you're really struggling, you can enable cheat codes to unlock all weapons and upgrades. This way, you can practice with each weapon without worrying about progression.    7. **Practice in the Fortress of Doom**: The Fortress of Doom serves as a hub where you can practice your weapons without the pressure of combat. Use this space to familiarize yourself with each weapon's mechanics and get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.    8. **Keep an Eye on Challenges**: Pay attention to the weapon challenges in the menu. They provide specific tasks that, when completed, will help you master each weapon. Make sure to focus on these during your playthrough.    By following these tips, you should be able to master every weapon in Doom Eternal's campaign without the need to replay missions. Happy slaying!
__label__0 Good afternoon everyone.

__label__0 My parents own a condo in downtown Toronto. Since I just graduated and will no longer stay in Toronto, they have been trying to sell the condo since beginning of August. We are not in need of money currently but my parents' first thought was that by selling the condo, they could just put the money into the bank and grew it through interest. However, the offers that came in are all significantly lower than what they wish for. They thought about renting it out instead given the current rental market but worry about potential messy tenant situations.     Would you just take the low offer and invest the money elsewhere or rent the condo out? Any suggestions are welcome!     If needed, I am willing to provide more details!

__label__1 I thought it would be fun to start a thread where we can share some simple but interesting little kinks that we might not usually talk about. These can be things that are easy to incorporate into your sex life or just little quirks that you find intriguing. Here are a few of mine:    1. **Whispering** - There's something incredibly intimate about whispering sweet nothings or even dirty talk in your partner's ear. It creates a sense of closeness and can heighten arousal.    2. **Role Reversal** - Sometimes, switching up the traditional roles in the bedroom can be exciting. Whether it's the more dominant partner taking a backseat or trying out a different dynamic, it can lead to some surprising experiences.    3. **Food Play** - Using food in a playful way can be a fun kink. Whether it’s chocolate syrup, whipped cream, or even just feeding each other, it adds a sensory element that can be really enjoyable.    4. **Public Displays of Affection** - Not necessarily full-on sex, but the thrill of a little PDA can be a huge turn-on. A quick kiss or a subtle touch in a public place can create a rush of excitement.    5. **Costumes** - Dressing up in costumes or themed outfits can add a fun twist to your usual routine. It can be anything from sexy nurse to superhero, and it allows for a bit of fantasy play.    I’d love to hear what little kinks you all have! Let’s share and maybe inspire each other to try something new!
__label__1 I have a 2010 Honda Accord with a 2.4L engine, and I've been experiencing some issues with the engine stalling intermittently. It usually happens when I'm idling at a stoplight or when I first start the car in the morning. The check engine light has come on a couple of times, but it goes off after a few days.     I've checked the oil level and it's fine, and I recently replaced the air filter. I also ran a diagnostic scan, and it showed a P0420 code, which I believe is related to the catalytic converter.     Could the catalytic converter be causing the stalling issue, or should I be looking at other components like the fuel system or ignition system? Any advice on what steps I should take next would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I've been experiencing daily nausea, lightheadedness, and shakiness, particularly in the evening hours, for the past few weeks. It usually starts around dinner time and can last for several hours. I often feel like I might faint, and my hands sometimes tremble.     I haven't changed my diet significantly, but I do have a pretty busy schedule, and I often skip meals or eat at irregular times. I also drink coffee in the morning, but I try to limit my caffeine intake after noon.     I’ve been trying to stay hydrated, but I’m not sure if that’s enough. I’ve also noticed that I feel a bit better if I eat something small, but the nausea returns after a while.     I don’t have any other symptoms like fever or severe pain, but this has been really disruptive to my evenings and overall well-being. I’m currently waiting for an appointment with my doctor, but in the meantime, I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice on what might be causing these symptoms or how to manage them until I can get seen.     Thanks in advance for any help!
__label__1 I've been microdosing with psilocybin for the past few months, and while I've experienced some positive effects like increased creativity and improved mood, I've also been feeling a bit concerned about my mental health. I've read some anecdotal reports about microdosing potentially triggering psychosis in individuals who may be predisposed to it, and I can't help but wonder if I might be one of those people.    I have a family history of mental health issues, and while I haven't experienced any severe symptoms myself, I do sometimes feel anxious or paranoid, especially when I'm under stress. Recently, I've noticed that during my microdosing days, I sometimes have fleeting thoughts that feel a bit out of control, like I'm losing touch with reality.     I’m curious if anyone else has had similar experiences or if there are any precautions I should take while continuing to microdose. Should I consider taking a break or consulting a mental health professional? I really want to enjoy the benefits of psychedelics without risking my mental well-being. Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been getting really into making mixtapes lately and I thought it would be fun to start a mixtape trade! I love the idea of sharing music in a tangible format and discovering new sounds through other people's tastes.

In return, I’d love to receive a mixtape from you with your favorite tracks or something you think I should hear.     Let’s keep it simple: just send me a message with your address and I’ll do the same. I can’t wait to see what you all come up with!     Feel free to share any themes or specific vibes you want to include in your mixtape. Happy trading!

I'm hoping to find someone who can keep the conversation flowing and maybe even share some laughs along the way. If you're interested, drop me a message! Looking forward to chatting with you!
__label__0 Title says it all, really. I can't seem to connect my dualsense controller to my PC without it disconnecting my bluetooth headphones. Does anyone know how to fix this?
__label__0 My colleague in my team \[35M\] who is married with a child was somewhat inappropriate with me \[20F\], but not anything serious or incriminating. After I put my foot down he has been subtly trying to sabotage me.    The background is that he had encouraged me a lot when I struggled with my then-boss who was very hellish. It started off normal in that he'd check in on me and I'd tell him I was doing fine, then we'd chat over Teams about nonsense stuff on the side while working. After some months he started to text me on weekends.    Being new to the working world, being asexual and having had zero experience with guys (only attended girls-only schools), I honestly thought he was genuine and wanted to be friends, so I'd just reply him. My female colleagues also vouched for him as a "nice, family man" and would hang out with him outside of work. He has a really good rep.    Some time later he began texting me extremely often, the kind where you know a married man shouldn't be doing that. He basically would text me every few hours me how was my day, whether I had eaten, and pretend not to know things and ask me for help. At this point I ignored and blocked him, but he would say cryptic things that sounded work-related (e.g. "boss is on leave but he said to work on this or that, text me about it") so I'd have no choice but to reply, and it'd end up being irrelevant and he just wanted to trick me into talking to him.    He also gets mad when I talk to other male colleagues. But TBH, the worst thing he's ever done is only to call me his "wife", "pretty", and "cute". As I said, he's not doing anything severe, but it's still annoying.    I started giving him the cold shoulder completely and replying very curtly. **He got irritated about it and nowadays he's been subtly trying to sabotage my work.** He is purposely difficult, e.g. asking a lot of questions before giving me information, or when I don't reply fast enough he goes to my boss to make it seem like I'm slacking off. I believe he's also badmouthing me to my other colleagues (some of his close friends have been saying "you think you're really great, don't you" in a joking-but-not-actually tone, you get my drift) as he has a good rep and people trust him. (He's also gross as hell and keeps staring at me or purposely trying to come over and sits behind me to watch me work on the pretext of talking to someone else. Just the other day he kept kicking the bottom of my chair while I was sitting on it, so I told him to quit it.)    The thing is that it's nothing incriminating enough to report him for, but it's just bloody annoying. And he has a good rep too. I want to avoid him as much as I can, specifically:    (1) move to another cubicle so he can't approach me so often -- but my current spot is good as I have easy access to my boss, and the bosses don't like people moving around    (2) move to another team -- this isn't possible as there are no openings, and i'm not keen on leaving right now before my pay raise    **Right now, I think it might be best to put up with him, but I also want to approach someone to tell them what is happening so at least I have insurance if he ever spreads rumours about me.** I'm not going to tell my boss because I honestly worry that it might end up being more negative for me, since my boss is good friends with him, so I was thinking I could just tell a colleague on the same level. Does that make sense, since I technically can't report him?    TIA.
__label__1 I've been searching for any official news regarding the compatibility of Pathfinder: Kingmaker with the PS5, but I haven't found much information. Given that the game was originally released for PS4, I was hoping to see some updates or announcements about whether it will be playable on the next-gen console.    Has anyone come across any statements from Owlcat Games or any other reliable sources about this? It would be great to know if we can expect any enhancements or if it will simply be backward compatible.     Also, if anyone has experience playing it on PS5 through backward compatibility, I'd love to hear how it runs! Any performance improvements or issues? Thanks!
__label__0  Today I tried running Battlefront 2 through Geforce and it was stuck on the triangular screen so I decided to reinstall it.    I downloaded the setup through the official geforce site and when I tried to do that it said that it couldnt install it because my laptop doesnt have an NVIDIA GPU. Yesterday it was working fine on every game like today except from Battlefront 2. Please help me Battlefront 2 is my favourite game and I cant stand not playing it.    In my Control Panel I cant find DirectX anywhere does that mean I dont have it installed? If yes should I install it?    Specs: 2GB AMD Radeon GPU    8GB RAM    AMD Ryzen 3 2-Core.

__label__0      ## What are we looking for    * A DM :D, aka, YOU!  * DnD 5e, homebrew or not, we don’t care.   * Lgbtqia+ friendly ✨😌🏳️‍🌈🌈🌟  * Voice call during the game, we normally use discord.  * Good communication, if anything needs to change or you want feedback just talk to us! We are all very open, understanding people and will hear you out.    ## Date and time    In the past we have played weekly at 1pm Eastern Daylight Time on Mondays. Ideally we would want to play at this time because it works for all of us, and had *consistently* for around a  year.    ## What we have done in the past as a group    Most of us met from our last campaign, but we had two groups that knew each other beforehand (Ollie and Dash, and then Marieke, Jelske, and Marco) Our last game was a Homebrew world made by our DM with a Few homebrew items and rules.    Sadly our DM had to stop, because of personal reasons :(. Now we are very sad, cause we wanna continue to play together Q\_Q. A lot of our playing was RP heavier rather than combat, but we do enjoy both! (that was just how it played out) It was high fantasy-isH, most of the world was based on parts of Europe.    Of course we don't expect all of these things to be the same for any DM we have, but because we are already a whole group I(Dash) believe that it's easier walking into a pre established group knowing what we have experienced in the past and who we are.    ## Who Are We?    ## We have 6 players overall. (Depending on certain events we may only have 5 players, but we wanted to start looking for a DM as soon as possible)  We may not have known each other the longest but as a group we feel we click quite well (In and out of character). We are fairly good at keeping a decent balance between ✨shenanigans✨ and serious RP.    **Dash-** She/They, 21 years old, American, Every excitable and friendly, cosplay is my nerdiness of choice. I work with animals for my job so u maY get photos of goats occasionally✨. Typically I played a lot of Clerics or just any form of a highly empathetic person. RP for group bonding in the little moments are one of my favorites &lt;3.    **Ollie-** Any Pronouns, 23 Year Old. Cosplayer, Video game enthusiast, Just a funky little gremlin. Finished up my culinary degree and am about to finish up my pastry degree. Food is my passion. &lt;3 I will ramble off about my interests, I’m sorry. RP is my favorite aspect. :)     **Leah-** This is the player that may or may not start playing with us, If she ends up being able to we will add more info here for her!    **Marieke-** she/her, 28 year old Disney and Harry Potter nerd. I play a lot of story based video games in my freetime. Also love to cook, watch funny animal videos and all the korean drama’s    **Marco-** He/Him, 31 years old. Love anything fantasy and sci-fi     **Jelske-**She/her, 32 years young. Animal lover and metalhead. I love playing board games with friends, especially if they’re co-op games. Also the color teal makes me very happy!     ## Triggers / BIG no no’s    * Bigotry (outside of rp)  * Unsynced singing (Marco only) STOP LOL  * Not having a session 0 TOGETHER!    ### Lines:    * Rape  * Abuse  * Bestiality  * Pedophilia   * PvP unless both players explicitly agree to it.     ### Veils:    * Sex  * Drug abuse     ## Things we like in Media:    * One Piece  * Dragon Age  * Critical Role (As Well as Several Other D&amp;D Podcasts)  * Genshin Impact  * The Witcher  * Stardew Valley  * Minecraft  * Star Wars  * Lord of the Rings  * Assassins Creed  * Game of Thrones season 1-6  * Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Cinematic Universe  * Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks/Studio Ghibli  * Avatar; the last Airbender  * Harry Potter    ## Other things     We are free to play 🥺    We are the absolute best players you’ll **EVER** meet!!

__label__0 I’m 20F. Guy I’m dating is 21M. Let me start by saying I’ve only been with my ex bf and that was 2 years ago. I guess u could say I’ve been holding out for Mr. right. Anyways I met this guy online and we’ve been going on dates. He’s super sweet to me, tall, attractive. I’ve even met his parents and we see each other all the time. Today things got more sexual between us. I actually was going to let sEx happen because of how great things have been between us. I was thrown off when I saw it though. It’s not small but I’m not sure if I’d consider it average either. I feel like a piece of shit right now because it’s completely changed the way I’m feeling. We did some other stuff but no actual sex because I’m scared it’ll be disappointing and I don’t want to do that with him unless I actually want to be with him in the long run. I only have sex experience with my ex and his was very big. So I’m not sure if this will do the job or not… I’d hate to end things over this but I don’t want disappointing sex.
__label__1 I've been learning Java for a while now, and I've come across various frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX. However, I'm a bit confused about when and why to use these frameworks in my projects.     Could someone explain the benefits of using frameworks in Java development? What are some common scenarios where a framework would be more advantageous than just using plain Java? Also, how do I choose the right framework for a specific project?     Any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 In a recent article, Peter Daszak, a prominent figure in the field of infectious diseases, has been linked to controversial claims regarding Ukraine and its historical ties to Nazi elements. This narrative has been circulating in various media outlets, often without substantial evidence, and seems to be part of a broader agenda to discredit scientific research and public health initiatives.    The article suggests that Daszak's work with the EcoHealth Alliance and his involvement in the Wuhan lab research somehow connects him to Ukraine's political landscape, particularly in relation to extremist groups. However, this connection is tenuous at best and appears to be a deliberate attempt to conflate unrelated issues to create a sensational story.    It's crucial to approach such claims with skepticism and demand rigorous evidence before accepting them as fact. Misinformation can easily spread, especially when it involves complex geopolitical issues and public health. We must remain vigilant against narratives that seek to undermine legitimate scientific discourse and promote division based on unfounded allegations.     Let's focus on the facts and hold those spreading misinformation accountable. #FightingFakeNews #ScienceMatters #CriticalThinking
__label__1 Dysphoria is a term that describes a profound sense of unease or dissatisfaction, often related to one's identity or body. For many transgender individuals, dysphoria can manifest as a disconnect between their gender identity and their physical appearance or societal expectations. It can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and frustration, as the person struggles with the mismatch between how they feel inside and how they are perceived externally.    For example, someone assigned female at birth who identifies as male might experience dysphoria when looking in the mirror and seeing breasts or a feminine face. This can be incredibly distressing and can affect various aspects of life, including social interactions, self-esteem, and mental health.    Dysphoria isn't the same for everyone; some may experience it intensely, while others might feel it more subtly. It's important to recognize that dysphoria is a valid experience and that seeking support, whether through therapy, community, or medical transition options, can be helpful in managing these feelings. Understanding dysphoria is a crucial step in the journey of many transgender individuals as they work towards aligning their external reality with their internal identity.
__label__1 I’ve been feeling really frustrated lately, and I just need to get this off my chest. It seems like everywhere I turn, I see hypocrisy in the people around me, and it’s driving me insane.     Take my workplace, for example. We have this manager who constantly preaches about work-life balance and how important it is to take time off for mental health. Yet, when someone actually takes a day off, they’re met with passive-aggressive comments about how they’re not committed to their job. It’s like, how can you say one thing and then act completely opposite?     And it’s not just at work. I see it in my friend group too. We have a friend who is always talking about how we should be more environmentally conscious and reduce our carbon footprint. But then, she’s the first one to hop in her car for a quick trip to the store instead of walking or biking. It’s just so frustrating to see people not practicing what they preach.     I know nobody is perfect, and we all have our flaws, but it feels like people are so quick to judge others while ignoring their own contradictions. It’s exhausting to navigate these double standards, and I’m starting to feel like I can’t trust anyone.     I just wish people would be more genuine and hold themselves accountable for their actions. It’s hard to take advice from someone who doesn’t follow it themselves. I guess I just needed to vent about this because it’s been weighing on my mind. Thanks for listening.
__label__1 I recently received a notification that my current bundle special rate with Xfinity has expired, and my bill has increased significantly. I was initially paying around $120 a month for internet and cable, but now it’s jumped to over $180.     I’ve been a loyal customer for several years, and I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what steps you took to negotiate a better rate.     I’ve heard that calling customer service can sometimes lead to getting a retention offer, but I’m not sure how to approach the conversation. Should I mention that I’m considering switching to another provider? Any tips on how to effectively negotiate would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance!

__label__0 My binder is kinda falling apart, as it was a lightly used gift from a friend anyway, but I’m looking for a new one. I know about gc2b and I’m heavily considering one, but my current one is an underworks binder, which I do really like. I was wondering if anyone had certain recommendations or links?   I’d like another one from underworks but I can’t figure out how the site works.   And my mom is actually helping me shop for one (yay for support!) and wants to get one off amazon, which I don’t fully trust for safety reasons, but if anyone knows any good ones from there that’d be cool!  Any suggestions or help is appreciated!
__label__1 I wanted to share my experience and get some perspective from the community. I'm a 34-year-old man currently living at my mother's house. This situation has been a mix of comfort and frustration for me. On one hand, I appreciate the support and stability it provides, especially in these uncertain times. On the other hand, I often feel a sense of societal pressure and judgment for not being fully independent at my age.    Growing up in a religious household, I was taught that adulthood meant moving out, getting married, and starting a family. However, my journey has taken a different path. I’ve struggled with finding a stable job in my field, and the cost of living has made it difficult to afford my own place.     I often wonder how many others in this community have faced similar situations. How do you cope with the stigma of living at home as an adult? Have you found ways to balance your independence while still living with family? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

__label__1 I've been playing Dragon City on the Microsoft Store version for a while now, and I've noticed an increase in ads popping up during gameplay. At first, I thought it was just a minor annoyance, but it seems to be affecting my overall experience.     I understand that ads are a way for the developers to monetize the game, especially in a free-to-play model, but the frequency and timing of these ads can be quite disruptive. For instance, I often get interrupted right when I'm about to complete a breeding or when I'm in the middle of a battle.     Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think there’s a way to reduce the number of ads, or maybe even a way to pay to remove them? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you might have for managing this issue.     Thanks!
__label__1 Alright fellow degenerates, let’s talk about $PRTY. I’ve been watching this stock closely and it’s starting to give off some serious $BBBY vibes.     For those who don’t know, Party City has been struggling with debt and supply chain issues, much like Bed Bath & Beyond did before its epic collapse. The stock has been on a rollercoaster ride lately, and I can’t help but feel like we’re at a tipping point here.     The recent earnings report was a disaster, and the stock tanked hard. But here’s the kicker: the short interest is through the roof! We’re talking about a potential short squeeze that could send this thing to the moon if the retail crowd rallies behind it.     I’m not saying to throw your life savings in, but if you’re looking for a risky play with potential upside, $PRTY might just be the ticket. Just remember to do your own research and don’t get caught holding the bag if things go south.     What do you guys think? Is this the next meme stock in the making, or are we just chasing shadows? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been struggling with a fear of getting hit by a car for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. Every time I have to cross the street, I feel this overwhelming sense of panic. I constantly look around, and even if the road is clear, my heart races and I feel like I can't breathe.     I know it sounds irrational, but I can't help it. I find myself avoiding going out or taking longer routes just to avoid busy streets. It's exhausting and isolating.     I've tried deep breathing exercises and grounding techniques, but when I'm in the moment, it feels like nothing works. I also worry about what others might think if they see me hesitating or panicking.     Has anyone else experienced this kind of fear? What strategies have you found helpful in managing it? I really want to overcome this and regain my confidence when it comes to being out in public.
__label__1 You asked: Do I need to blanch spinach before cooking?      Blanching spinach before cooking is not strictly necessary, but it can be beneficial depending on how you plan to use it. Blanching involves briefly boiling the spinach and then plunging it into ice water to stop the cooking process. This technique can help preserve the vibrant green color, enhance the flavor, and reduce the oxalic acid content, which can sometimes interfere with calcium absorption.      If you're using spinach in a salad or as a garnish, blanching can help maintain its bright color and tender texture. However, if you're sautéing or adding it to soups, you can skip this step and cook it directly. Just be mindful that fresh spinach wilts down significantly when cooked, so you may want to start with a larger quantity than you think you'll need.      In summary, while blanching is not required, it can improve the overall quality of your dish. Happy cooking!

__label__1 I (25F) recently had a falling out with my best friend (26F) over something that happened during a group trip we took together. We were all having a great time, but there was a moment when she made a joke at my expense in front of everyone. It was meant to be light-hearted, but it really hurt my feelings. I tried to laugh it off at the time, but later that night, I confronted her about it. I told her that I didn’t appreciate the joke and that it made me feel embarrassed and belittled.    She brushed it off, saying I was being too sensitive and that it was just a joke. I felt really dismissed and hurt by her response. Since then, I’ve been feeling really conflicted. I’ve always valued our friendship, but I can’t shake off the feeling that she doesn’t take my feelings seriously. I’ve been thinking about whether I should just let it go or if I should stand my ground and let her know how much it affected me.    Now, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting. Am I being too sensitive about this? Should I just move on and not let it affect our friendship, or is it important to address it? I really don’t want to lose her as a friend, but I also don’t want to feel like I have to tolerate being the punchline of her jokes. Any advice would be appreciated!

__label__1 I've been tracking my glucose levels while on keto, and I've noticed something interesting that I wanted to share and get your thoughts on. After I eat a meal, I often see an initial decrease in my blood sugar levels, which is quite surprising. However, this is usually followed by a delayed increase a little while later.     I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this and what you think might be causing it.     From my understanding, it could be related to several factors:  1. **Insulin Response**: After eating, especially if the meal has some protein, my body might initially release insulin, which can lower blood sugar levels before it starts to rise again as the glucose from the meal enters the bloodstream.  2. **Gluconeogenesis**: Since I’m on keto, my body is in a state of ketosis, and it might be producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (like protein) after the initial drop, leading to a delayed increase.  3. **Hormonal Fluctuations**: Stress hormones like cortisol can also play a role in blood sugar regulation, potentially causing fluctuations after meals.  4. **Food Composition**: The types of foods I’m eating could also be affecting my blood sugar response. For example, high-fat meals might slow down digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream.    I’d love to hear if anyone else has tracked similar patterns and what you’ve learned about your own glucose responses on keto. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been considering getting the Quest 2 for a while now, but I'm still on the fence about whether it will meet my needs. I mainly want to use it for gaming and some social VR experiences. I've heard great things about the library of games available and the overall performance, but I’m curious if it can handle more demanding titles without any issues.     Also, how is the battery life during extended play sessions? I’ve read mixed reviews about that.     For those who have been using the Quest 2, do you think it will do the job for someone who wants a solid VR experience without breaking the bank? Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

My partner and I are expecting our first baby in March, and we’re still trying to finalize our list of names. We have a few favorites, but nothing feels perfect yet.     We’re leaning towards a name that has a nice balance of being unique but not too out there. We want something that has a good meaning and flows well with our last name.     So, for those of you who have already named your babies, what names did you choose and what inspired you? Did you have a specific theme or meaning in mind? Any stories behind the names would be great to hear too!     Thanks in advance for sharing!
__label__1 I've been playing NBA 2K on current gen for a while now, and I'm thinking about making the switch to next gen.

How does the MyCareer mode compare? I've also heard that the park experience is a lot different.     Any tips for someone transitioning from current to next gen? I want to make sure I get the most out of the new features and gameplay mechanics. Thanks!
__label__1 It's interesting to think about how the motivations for war have shifted over time. In the past, leaders would often instigate conflicts to expand their territories or enrich their coffers. Nowadays, starting a war can lead to severe consequences, including loss of power, economic sanctions, and international isolation. It seems like the world is slowly moving towards a system where diplomacy and cooperation are valued more than brute force. Maybe this is a sign of progress, or perhaps just a reflection of the changing landscape of global politics.

__label__1 In the realm of animated films, particularly those aimed at children, it’s not uncommon to encounter themes that reflect broader societal issues. Two recent entries, *Trolls World Tour* and *Frozen 2*, while seemingly light-hearted and whimsical, delve into deeper narratives that touch upon cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing, albeit in a manner that is accessible to younger audiences.     *SPOILERS AHEAD*    In *Trolls World Tour*, the plot revolves around the discovery of different musical tribes, each representing a distinct genre: pop, rock, country, funk, and more. The film’s antagonist, Queen Barb, seeks to eliminate all other music genres to establish rock as the supreme form of expression. This quest for musical dominance can be interpreted as a metaphor for cultural genocide, where one culture seeks to eradicate others in the name of superiority. The film cleverly uses music as a vehicle to explore themes of diversity and acceptance, ultimately advocating for the coexistence of different cultures rather than their obliteration. The resolution, where the various tribes unite to celebrate their differences, serves as a powerful commentary on the importance of cultural preservation and the dangers of cultural hegemony.    On the other hand, *Frozen 2* presents a more nuanced exploration of historical injustices and the consequences of colonialism. The film’s narrative arc reveals that the kingdom of Arendelle has a dark past involving the mistreatment of the Northuldra people, an indigenous group that lived in harmony with nature. Elsa and Anna’s journey to uncover the truth about their family’s history serves as a poignant reminder of the impact of colonialism and the erasure of indigenous cultures. The film does not shy away from addressing the consequences of these actions, as the spirits of the forest seek justice for the wrongs committed against their people. This narrative thread highlights the importance of acknowledging and reconciling with the past, a crucial step in healing and moving forward.    Both films, while entertaining, serve as vehicles for important discussions about cultural identity, the consequences of oppression, and the necessity of understanding and embracing diversity. They challenge young audiences to think critically about the world around them and the histories that shape it.     In conclusion, *Trolls World Tour* and *Frozen 2* may appear to be simple children’s movies, but they engage with complex themes of cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing in a way that is both accessible and thought-provoking. By weaving these narratives into their plots, they encourage viewers to reflect on the importance of cultural diversity and the need for empathy and understanding in a world that often seeks to divide.
__label__1 I've been seeing a lot of ads for face shapers and jawline sculptors lately, and I'm really curious if they actually work. I’ve read mixed reviews online, with some people swearing by them and others saying they’re just a gimmick.     I’m particularly interested in the ones that claim to help with contouring the jawline and reducing puffiness. If anyone has tried these products, could you share your experiences? Did you notice any visible results? How long did it take for you to see changes, if any?     Also, are there any specific brands or types that you would recommend or advise against? I’m looking for something that’s effective but also safe to use. Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__1 I’m currently in the process of applying to graduate programs and I wanted to clarify how dual credits (college courses taken while in high school) are viewed by admissions committees.     I took several dual credit courses during my senior year, and I’m wondering if these will be considered as part of my academic record. Do graduate programs typically look at these credits when evaluating my undergraduate GPA, or are they only focused on the courses taken after high school?     Additionally, if they do consider them, how might that impact my application? I’ve heard mixed opinions on this, so I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with this or insights into how different programs handle dual credits. Thanks!
__label__1 I’ve been watching Kenny Pickett this season, and I have to say, he might just be the nicest quarterback in the league! I mean, how many QBs do you see actually telling defenders where to go? It’s like he’s out there playing a game of chess while everyone else is just trying to play football.     I remember that one play where he was about to get sacked, and instead of just trying to escape, he calmly pointed out to the defender where he wanted him to go. It’s almost like he’s saying, "Hey, I know you’re trying to tackle me, but how about you take a step to the left?"     It’s refreshing to see a player with such a positive attitude on the field, especially in a sport that can get so intense. I think this speaks volumes about his character and leadership. He’s not just focused on winning; he’s also trying to make the game enjoyable for everyone involved.     What do you all think? Is Pickett the nicest QB in the league, or is there someone else who deserves that title? Let’s hear your thoughts!
__label__1 I've been hanging out with this girl for a while now, and I've noticed that when we're close, she often moves her hips to touch mine. At first, I thought it might just be a coincidence, but it seems to happen quite frequently.     I can't help but wonder if this is a good sign that she's interested in me. I mean, it feels flirty and playful, but I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into it.     Have any of you experienced something similar? What does it usually mean when someone does this? Should I take it as a sign to make a move, or could it just be her way of being friendly? Any insights would be appreciated!

__label__1 Quiet quitting has become a popular term lately, and it raises an interesting debate about employee engagement and workplace culture. On one hand, some might view quiet quitting as a sign of a bad employee who is disengaged and not willing to go above and beyond in their role. This perspective often emphasizes the importance of dedication and commitment to one's job, suggesting that employees should always strive to exceed expectations and contribute to the company's success.    On the other hand, many argue that quiet quitting can be a smart move, especially in environments where employees feel overworked, undervalued, or unappreciated. In this context, quiet quitting might be a form of self-preservation, where employees set boundaries to maintain their mental health and work-life balance. It can also be a response to a lack of support or recognition from management, signaling that the workplace culture needs to change.    Ultimately, whether quiet quitting is seen as a sign of a bad employee or a smart one may depend on the specific circumstances of the workplace and the individual's reasons for their behavior. What do you think? Is quiet quitting a red flag, or is it a necessary response to a toxic work environment?
__label__1 In the world of The Owl House, we often find ourselves debating which characters or story arcs are the most compelling. So, I wanted to pose a question to the community: which would be better for the series moving forward - a deeper exploration of Luz's relationship with her mother, or a focus on the development of the Collector as a more complex character?    On one hand, Luz's relationship with her mother has been a significant emotional thread throughout the series. Delving deeper into their dynamic could provide a rich narrative that explores themes of acceptance, identity, and the challenges of balancing two worlds. It could also give us more insight into Luz's motivations and how her experiences in the Boiling Isles shape her relationship with her family back home.    On the other hand, the Collector has been introduced as a mysterious and powerful figure, and there’s so much potential for character development there. If the show were to focus on the Collector, we could see a transformation from a seemingly chaotic antagonist to a more nuanced character with their own struggles and motivations. This could add layers to the story and create interesting conflicts with the main cast.    So, what do you all think? Which direction would you prefer to see the show take? More family dynamics with Luz and her mom, or a deeper dive into the Collector's character? Let’s discuss!

__label__0 My guess is that there are more younger fans coming in and that this is their first competitive season that they've seen live. It's kind of appalling to see so many people commenting so much negative stuff on every single post about the Blue Devils and complaining so much. It's not a good look. Every year it happens but this year it's like x1000. Again, I think it's just kids coming in and being indoctrinated (for lack of a better term) to just hate the Blue Devils. It happened to me when I first got in high school but then years later I learned to appreciate them. I think their show was really good, maybe my favorite.
__label__0 I for some reason cannot use the third party maps to navigate, does anyone have some tips to help? Thanks &lt;3
__label__0 Sorry the title is vague. So I filed about 6 months ago and did some C&amp;P exams but not for everything I claimed.   I didn’t have exams for things in which I have a huge amount of documentation with clear service connection.    I checked my bank account today and received back pay for an amount of 30%, which I thought was low for my claim but 🤷‍♂️. Moreover, I checked my claim and it is still in “investigation” status.     Finally, I looked at the details of my claim, and saw that the things in which I had a huge amount of documentation were not listed as things I claimed!! I KNOW I claimed these because they are major major issues and there’s no possible way I could have forgotten to add them to my claim.     For example: I claimed Left Knee Pain, which is minor, but something I felt needed to be added. I also claimed Lower Back Pain which is a huge deal in my life and which I have a ton of documentation. I had no exam for the low back and when I checked the low back is not on the list of conditions I claimed. Add this to the back payment before my claim was settled, and I’m awfully confused.     Can anyone advise?

__label__0 hi! im a junior in high school considering being a music ed major in college and i’ve taken it upon myself to start looking at some scores i can get my hands on and just get acquainted with how different instruments work. im super interested in how bands work together and how composers do their thing. i’m the assist. music director for a show i’m working on, and before our rehearsals start i’m just trying to get really familiar with the music, so i’ve been studying and annotating my conductor script.   im looking for tips on how to productively look at my music (a conductor script for a musical, it’s a keyboard part with all instrumentation cues and i think all of the vocal/line cues) and how to annotate and understand it best. i can read music well, i’ve been taking lessons in various instruments for twelve years. i am not a fantastic piano player, but i know my way around the instrument if this helps for context.   also!! i keep seeing “bs” as an abbreviation in the cues. what does this mean? i cannot for the life of me figure it out
__label__1 I've been getting into digital art recently and I'm trying to figure out which app would be best for drawing. I've heard a lot about Procreate, but I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. I also see a lot of artists using Adobe Fresco and Clip Studio Paint.     What do you all recommend? Are there any free options that are good for beginners? I’m looking for something that has a good variety of brushes and tools, and ideally, something that’s user-friendly. Any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I've been having some issues with the Focus Status feature on my iPhone since updating to iOS 16. I’ve set up my Focus modes, but it seems like my status isn’t being shared with my contacts as it should be.     I’ve checked the settings and made sure that the option to share my Focus status is enabled, but it still doesn’t seem to work. I’ve also tried toggling the Focus modes on and off, and even restarting my phone, but nothing seems to help.     Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any tips or solutions would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’ve always been curious about how people approach their meals. Personally, I have a specific order I follow when I eat. For example, when I have a burger and fries, I always start with the burger. I like to savor the main part of the meal first while it’s still hot and fresh. Once I finish the burger, I move on to the fries. I find that if I eat the fries first, I tend to fill up on them and lose my appetite for the burger.     After I finish both, I usually take a few sips of my drink, but I save the last few sips for after I’m done eating. It feels like a nice way to cleanse my palate after the meal.     I’m curious if anyone else has a specific eating order or routine they follow. Do you eat your food in a particular sequence? What’s your reasoning behind it?
__label__1 Hey fellow racers!     I’m currently trying to push my way up the ranks in multiplayer, and I’m curious about the potential of my garage. I have the following cars:    1. **Lamborghini Huracán Performante** (maxed out)  2. **McLaren 720S** (2 stars)  3. **Aston Martin Vulcan** (3 stars)    I’m currently sitting in Gold League, and I’m wondering if these cars can help me reach Platinum or even Legend League.     I’ve been practicing my racing lines and nitro management, but I’m not sure if my car choices are competitive enough against the higher-tier vehicles I often face.     What do you all think? Should I focus on upgrading these cars further, or is there a better strategy to climb the ranks? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! 🚗💨
__label__1 I've been doing a lot of reading about Freemasonry and I'm really interested in joining, but I'm not sure who to approach about it. I don't have any family or friends who are Masons, so I'm a bit lost on how to start the process.     Is it best to reach out to a local lodge directly, or should I try to find someone in the community who might be able to guide me? Also, are there any specific questions I should ask when I do find someone to talk to?     Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I’m looking for gift ideas for my senseis as a way to show my appreciation for their guidance and support. I’ve been studying Japanese for a while now, and I want to give them something thoughtful that reflects my gratitude.     I know that in Japan, it’s common to give gifts, especially when it comes to teachers, but I’m not sure what would be appropriate. I want to avoid anything too extravagant or personal, as I don’t want to make them uncomfortable.     Here are a few ideas I’ve considered:  1. **Japanese sweets (wagashi)** - I’ve heard that traditional sweets are a nice gesture, especially if they come from a local shop.   2. **Stationery** - High-quality pens or notebooks can be practical and appreciated, especially for teachers who often write notes or grade papers.   3. **Tea** - A nice selection of Japanese tea could be a great gift, as it’s a big part of the culture.   4. **Omiyage** - If I travel somewhere, I could bring back local specialties as a gift.   5. **Books** - A book related to their interests or a beautiful art book could be a thoughtful choice.     I’d love to hear your thoughts on these ideas or if you have any other suggestions! What have you given to your senseis in the past? Any tips on presentation or etiquette would also be appreciated!

Is there anything I might be missing? I want to ensure I’m fully prepared and not caught off guard by any unexpected costs. Any advice or additional expenses I should consider would be greatly appreciated!     Thanks!

__label__1 An eighteenth-century German named Matthew Birchinger, known as "the little man of Nuremberg," played four musical instruments including the bagpipes, was an expert calligrapher, and was the most famous stage magician of his day. He performed tricks with the cup and balls that have never been explained.     Oh, and did I mention he was only 29 inches tall? Talk about a multi-talented little legend! Imagine him wowing crowds with his magic while simultaneously playing a lively tune on the bagpipes. I can only picture the audience's faces, half in awe and half in disbelief, as this tiny magician pulled off feats that left everyone scratching their heads.     Birchinger was a true pioneer, proving that size doesn’t matter when it comes to talent. I mean, if he can master all that, what’s your excuse for not learning to juggle?      #ShortAndTalented #MagicMan #NurembergLegend

__label__1 I've been experimenting with cock rings lately, and let me tell you, they can be a game changer for us big guys. I always thought they were just for aesthetics or for guys who needed a little help, but I’ve found they can really enhance the experience.     First off, the added pressure feels amazing. It keeps everything nice and firm, and I’ve noticed that it helps me last longer during intimate moments. Plus, the way it makes everything look is a bonus—definitely adds to the visual appeal.     However, finding the right size can be tricky. I’ve tried a few different materials and sizes, and I’ve learned that a snug fit is key, but not too tight! I made the mistake of going too small once, and let’s just say it wasn’t a pleasant experience.     For those of you with a larger size, I recommend looking for adjustable options or ones made from stretchy materials. It’s all about comfort and pleasure, right?     What are your experiences with cock rings? Any recommendations for brands or styles that work well for us with BDP? Let’s share some tips!
__label__1 I can't believe my luck! Just a week after pulling my last LD5, I managed to pull another one - Benedict! 🎉    For those who don't know, Benedict is a Light Beast Monk and he seems like a fantastic addition to my roster. His skills look promising for both PvE and PvP content, especially with his ability to cleanse and provide immunity.     I'm still figuring out the best way to build him. I’m considering a speed/HP build to maximize his utility in RTA, but I’d love to hear how others have built him and what runes you recommend.     Also, any tips on how to effectively use him in different scenarios would be greatly appreciated!     Feeling super excited about this pull and can’t wait to test him out in some battles! Let’s go! 💪✨

__label__1 I recently purchased the Logitech G Pro Wireless Headset, and I was really excited to use it for gaming and streaming. However, after only a few weeks of light use, I started experiencing some issues.     The sound quality has noticeably degraded, with static and crackling noises coming through the left ear cup. Additionally, the headset has started to disconnect randomly from my PC, even when the battery is fully charged. I’ve tried resetting the headset and updating the firmware through G Hub, but nothing seems to work.     Has anyone else experienced similar issues with their G Pro Wireless Headset? I’m wondering if this is a common problem or if I just happened to get a defective unit. Should I reach out to Logitech support for a replacement, or is there something else I can try to fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
__label__1 I was reminiscing about the days when Costco had their own branded American Express card before switching to the Visa card. I remember how the transition was a big deal for many members. The American Express card had some great perks, especially for travel rewards, but I also recall that it wasn't accepted everywhere, which was a downside for some.    When Costco made the switch to the Visa card, it felt like a game changer! The Visa card opened up a lot more acceptance at various retailers, and the cashback rewards were pretty appealing too. I loved that you could earn 2% back on all purchases at Costco and 1% on everything else.     Does anyone else remember the transition? What were your thoughts on the switch? Did you find the Visa card to be better or worse than the old American Express? I’d love to hear your experiences!
__label__1 Hey everyone! I recently got my septum pierced about a week ago, and I wanted to get some feedback on the placement. I went to a reputable piercer who has done a lot of work for me in the past, so I trust their skills.     However, I’ve been looking at it in the mirror and I’m not entirely sure if it’s positioned correctly. It seems to sit a bit higher than I expected, but I’ve seen some people with higher placements that look great.     I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference. I’m also experiencing some mild swelling and tenderness, which I know is normal for a fresh piercing, but I’m just a bit anxious about the placement.     Could you all share your thoughts? Is there a general rule for how low or high a septum should be? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

__label__1 I've been in an on/off relationship with my ex for about three years now. We’ve broken up and gotten back together more times than I can count, and every time it feels like we’re starting fresh. But this time, he told me it’s final. He said he’s tired of the cycle and wants to move on for good.     I’m feeling a mix of emotions right now. Part of me is relieved because I know the back-and-forth was unhealthy, but another part of me is devastated. I keep thinking about all the good times we had and how hard it is to let go of someone who has been such a big part of my life.     I’ve been trying to focus on myself, but it’s hard when I keep replaying memories in my head. I know I need to cut off contact to truly heal, but the thought of never talking to him again is terrifying.     How do I deal with this final breakup? How do I move on when I’ve been so used to having him in my life? Any advice on coping strategies or how to start the healing process would be greatly appreciated.
__label__1 I've been jumping into Warzone today and noticed a strange issue: there are absolutely no vehicles spawning on the map. I’ve checked multiple matches and it’s the same story every time.     At first, I thought it might just be a fluke, but after a few games, it’s clear something is off. I know vehicles can be a game-changer, especially for rotations and getting out of sticky situations, so this is really impacting gameplay.     Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a bug or are the devs trying something new? I’d love to hear if anyone has found a workaround or if this is just a temporary glitch. Let’s discuss!

I keep imagining all the worst-case scenarios: what if I can’t find my classes? What if I don’t make any friends? What if I freeze up during presentations?     I’ve tried to remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that I can take things one step at a time, but it’s still tough. I’d love to hear from anyone who has gone through similar feelings before school started. How did you cope? Did it get better once you settled in? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

Let's share our knowledge and help each other become better players!      Happy scaping!
__label__1 Season 2 of The Boys has been a wild ride so far, and I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on it!     First off, the character development has been phenomenal. I think we’re seeing a much deeper side of characters like Homelander and Starlight. Homelander’s descent into madness is both terrifying and fascinating, and I love how they’re exploring his vulnerabilities alongside his overwhelming power. Starlight’s struggle with her identity and the moral dilemmas she faces really resonate with the audience, making her one of the most relatable characters.    The introduction of new characters like Stormfront has added a fresh dynamic to the show. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about her at first, but her complex motivations and the way she challenges the status quo of the Seven is intriguing. Plus, the social commentary on issues like racism and media manipulation feels more relevant than ever.    On the action front, the fight scenes have been intense and well-choreographed. The way the show balances dark humor with brutal violence is something I really appreciate. It keeps the tone unpredictable, which is part of what makes The Boys so engaging.    However, I do have some concerns. At times, it feels like the pacing has been a bit uneven, especially in the middle episodes. Some plotlines seem to drag on while others feel rushed. I hope they can tie everything together in a satisfying way by the end of the season.    Overall, I’m loving Season 2 and can’t wait to see how it all unfolds. What do you all think? Any favorite moments or characters so far?

__label__1 Hey BBQ enthusiasts!      I’m looking for some advice on temperature and fire management while smoking meats. I’ve been experimenting with different cuts and techniques, but I often find myself struggling to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the cook.      For example, I recently tried smoking a pork shoulder and started off at around 225°F, but after a few hours, I noticed the temperature creeping up to 250°F and even higher at times. I’m using a charcoal smoker, and I’m not sure if I’m adding too much fuel or if I need to adjust my vents more effectively.      What are your go-to methods for keeping the temperature steady? Do you have any tips for managing the fire, especially during longer cooks? Also, how do you handle temperature fluctuations when you’re not able to monitor it constantly?      Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to hearing your tips and tricks!

__label__1 I've been thinking about this for a while now and I can't help but notice the striking similarities between Akshay Kumar and Karthik Aryan. Both actors have that charming, boy-next-door vibe that makes them incredibly relatable to the audience.     Their comic timing is also quite similar, with both of them excelling in light-hearted roles that often have a social message. Plus, they both have a knack for balancing commercial hits with more meaningful cinema.     Not to mention, their fashion sense seems to align too! Whether it's casual wear or formal attire, both Akshay and Karthik have a way of pulling off looks that resonate with the youth.     Do you think Karthik is the next Akshay in the making? Or is it just me seeing things? Would love to hear your thoughts!
__label__0 I’ll start…    Going through all my duffels that I haven’t touched in months to put together a 3 page packing list for a TDY.    I’ll take a spicy chicken sandwich with a side salad and lemon water.
__label__0 I'm on Xbox One, playing Fallout 4 GOTY Edition but I currently don't have wifi (army barracks don't got wifi yet), so I don't have any of the DLC's downloaded so it's just the base game. I wanted to try survival mode and I can switch it to Survival. I started a new playthrough on Survival but I can still save, fast travel, etc.. How do I actually do survival mode? Can I play it without having to download something (due to lack of wifi)?

__label__1 The sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across the small kitchen. Sarah stood at the stove, stirring a pot of simmering soup, the aroma filling the air with comfort. She glanced over her shoulder at Mark, who was seated at the table, a gentle smile on his face as he flipped through a book of poetry she had left there for him. It had been three months since the accident, three months since the man she once feared had become someone she could almost love.    Mark had been a different person before the crash. The man who had once shouted and thrown things in fits of rage was now soft-spoken, his eyes reflecting a kindness that had been buried deep beneath layers of anger and pain. The concussion had stripped away the worst of his memories, leaving only fragments of the man he used to be. Sarah had seized the opportunity to reshape him, to guide him toward a gentler existence.    "What do you think of this one?" he asked, his voice low and thoughtful. He read aloud a line about love and redemption, and Sarah felt her heart swell.     "It’s beautiful, Mark. You have a way with words now," she replied, her smile genuine.     He looked up, his brow furrowing slightly. "I don’t remember writing anything like this. Did I?"    "No, but you’re discovering new things about yourself. It’s wonderful to see you like this," she encouraged, hoping to steer the conversation away from the shadows of his past.     But as the days turned into weeks, Sarah noticed the flickers of recognition in his eyes. Sometimes, when he looked at her, she could see the struggle within him, the battle between the man he was and the man he was becoming.     One evening, as they sat on the porch watching the sunset, Mark turned to her, his expression serious. "I’ve been having dreams, Sarah. Dreams of a woman who looks like you, but she’s scared. I can’t remember why, but I feel like I’ve hurt her."    Her heart raced, and she fought to keep her voice steady. "Those dreams are just remnants of your past. You’re not that man anymore. You’re changing, and I believe in you."    He nodded slowly, but she could see the doubt creeping in. The next day, he found an old photo of them together, taken before the accident. The man in the picture was smiling, but the eyes were cold, devoid of warmth.     "Who is this?" he asked, his voice trembling.     "That’s you, Mark. Before the accident. You were... different then. But you’re not that man anymore. You’re better now."    He stared at the photo, and she could see the gears turning in his mind. The memories were coming back, and with them, the fear that he would revert to his old self.     Days passed, and the tension in the air grew thicker. Mark was quieter, lost in thought, and Sarah felt the weight of his memories pressing down on them both. One night, as they lay in bed, he turned to her, his voice barely a whisper. "What if I can’t stay like this? What if I go back to being that man?"    Tears filled her eyes as she reached for his hand. "You have the power to choose, Mark. You’ve shown me that you want to be better. You can fight against those memories. You can be kind."    But the next morning, he woke up with a jolt, memories flooding back like a tidal wave. He remembered the fights, the hurtful words, the fear he had instilled in her. He stumbled into the kitchen, his face pale, and Sarah felt her heart drop.    "I remember everything, Sarah. I remember who I was. I don’t want to be that man, but I don’t know how to stop it."    She stepped closer, her heart racing. "You can choose to be different. You’ve already started. You’re not that man anymore, Mark. You’re stronger than your past."    He looked at her, desperation in his eyes. "But what if I can’t control it? What if I hurt you again?"    "You won’t. I believe in you. We can work through this together. You’re not alone."    As he searched her face for reassurance, she could see the flicker of hope battling against the shadows of his past. It was a long road ahead, but she was determined to help him navigate it. Together, they would face the memories, and together, they would forge a new path—one filled with kindness, love, and the promise of a brighter future.
__label__1 I just wanted to share my thoughts on "Loxe Exile" by Ace. This track has been on repeat for me lately! The production is top-notch, and Ace's flow is just incredible. I love how he blends different styles and keeps it fresh.     For those who haven't heard it yet, the lyrics really dive into themes of struggle and resilience, which I think resonates with a lot of us here in Duval. Plus, the beat has that perfect vibe for cruising around Jacksonville.     What do you all think? Any favorite lines or moments from the song? Also, are there any other local artists you think are on the rise like Ace? Let’s support our homegrown talent!
__label__1 Pickles are made by preserving cucumbers, transforming them into a tangy snack, while raisins are dried grapes, which means they lose moisture and sweetness. So, pickles enhance and change the original cucumber, while raisins diminish and alter the original grape. It's a funny contrast in how we process these fruits and vegetables!

__label__1 Real Mountain Dew probably doesn’t taste that good, but the idea of it being a refreshing citrus drink is what makes it so appealing. It's like how we romanticize the taste of things we've never actually tried, and sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality.
__label__1 I recently built a new PC and I'm having trouble getting my monitor to display anything. Here’s what I’ve done so far:    - I’ve connected the monitor to the GPU using an HDMI cable.  - The monitor is powered on and I’ve tried using a different HDMI cable and port.  - I’ve reseated the GPU and made sure it’s properly connected to the motherboard.  - I’ve also checked that the power supply is functioning and providing enough wattage for the GPU.  - I’ve tried booting the PC with just one stick of RAM in different slots.    Despite all this, the monitor remains blank and doesn’t even show the BIOS screen. I’m not sure if it’s a problem with the GPU, the monitor, or something else entirely.     Any suggestions on what I should try next? I really appreciate any help!
__label__1 Imagine having the power to ask for any amount of money at any time, but with a catch: for every dollar you request, your risk of dying from gonorrhea increases by 0.01%.     At first, it sounds like a dream come true. Need a new car? Just ask for $20,000! But wait, that’s a 200% increase in your risk of a painful and embarrassing death.     You start to weigh your options. Do you really need that new gaming console? Is it worth the potential 0.01% increase in your gonorrhea death risk?     You find yourself in awkward situations, like at a restaurant, trying to decide if you should ask for the check to be split or just pay for the whole meal. "Hey, can I get $50 for this burger?" Oh no, that’s a 0.5% increase!     And don’t even get me started on the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. "Hey, can I borrow $100?" Suddenly, you’re calculating your risk of dying from a sexually transmitted infection instead of just enjoying a night out.     In the end, you become a master of budgeting and risk assessment, but at what cost? You’re constantly paranoid about your health, and every dollar feels like a gamble with your life.     So, while you can ask for any amount of money at any time, you might just end up broke and terrified of gonorrhea instead.
__label__1 I've been playing Red Dead Online for a while now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on whether it's worth diving into for those who might be on the fence.     First off, the world is absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in the environments, from the sprawling plains to the bustling towns, really immerses you in the Wild West. If you enjoy exploring, there's so much to see and do, from hunting legendary animals to discovering hidden treasures.    The gameplay itself can be a mixed bag. There are various roles you can take on, like a bounty hunter, trader, or moonshiner, which adds a lot of variety. Each role has its own unique missions and progression system, which keeps things fresh. However, some players have expressed frustration with the grind and the economy, feeling that it can be a bit slow to earn money and rewards.    The community aspect is also worth mentioning. Playing with friends can be a blast, whether you're teaming up for missions or just causing some chaos in free roam. However, the player interactions can be hit or miss; sometimes you’ll encounter friendly players, while other times you might run into griefers.    Overall, if you enjoy open-world games and the idea of living out a cowboy fantasy, Red Dead Online can be a lot of fun. Just be prepared for some grind and the occasional frustrating encounter. What do you all think? Is it worth it for newcomers?
__label__1 Hey everyone! I'm a 24-year-old female looking to meet up with some cool guys in the Houston area. I'm open to hanging out, grabbing a drink, or just chatting and getting to know each other. I enjoy outdoor activities, trying new restaurants, and exploring the city.     If you're interested, send me a message! I'm looking for someone fun and easygoing. Let's see where things go!
__label__0 I suddenly thought of and went back to watch Love and War by CeraRain (as funny as I remember it 😂) and for the life of me couldn’t remember remember the other Maplestory YouTube video I loved as a kid. It had a dragon brother and sister and a girl who who finds and picks up the younger brother. The younger brother is the small baby yellow dragon and I think the sister was some middle stage Evan dragon. I don’t think there was any voice acting but I remember it being very funny. If anyone else remembers it please let me know! I remember loving it so much as a kid and am horrified I can’t remember the name of it or find it.
__label__1 When you plug an appliance into an electrical outlet, the electricity supplied is at a standard voltage (typically 120V in North America or 230V in many other parts of the world). However, the amount of power that your equipment actually uses depends on its design and requirements.    Here's how it works:    1. **Voltage and Current**: The outlet provides a constant voltage, but the current (measured in amperes) drawn by your device varies based on its power needs. Each device is designed to operate at a specific voltage and will draw only the amount of current it needs to function properly.     2. **Power Rating**: Every electrical device has a power rating, usually indicated in watts (W). This rating tells you how much power the device will consume when operating. For example, a device rated at 100W will draw approximately 0.83A at 120V (using the formula Power = Voltage x Current).    3. **Internal Components**: Inside your device, there are components like transformers, resistors, and capacitors that help regulate the power usage. These components ensure that the device operates efficiently and safely, converting the incoming voltage and current into the appropriate levels needed for the device's operation.    4. **Power Supply Units (PSUs)**: Many devices, especially electronics, have power supply units that convert the AC voltage from the outlet into the DC voltage that the device needs. The PSU will also regulate the current to ensure that the device receives the correct amount of power.    5. **Safety Features**: Most devices are equipped with safety features such as fuses or circuit breakers that will cut off power if the device tries to draw too much current, preventing overheating or damage.    In summary, the electricity from your outlet provides a constant voltage, but the actual power consumed by your equipment is determined by its design and power requirements. The device will only draw the amount of current it needs, ensuring that it operates safely and efficiently.
__label__1 I'm looking to get a digital perm and was wondering if anyone has recommendations for salons in the Sacramento area that do a great job with them. I've heard mixed reviews about different places, so I’d love to hear about your experiences.     If you have a stylist you trust or a specific salon that specializes in this type of perm, please share! Also, any tips on what to ask for or what to expect would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I recently had an experience that really shook my confidence as an actor. I went in for an audition that I felt went incredibly well. I connected with the material, the casting director seemed engaged, and I left the room feeling like I had really nailed it. I even got some positive feedback from the reader, which is always a good sign, right?    Fast forward to less than 48 hours later, I received a callback. I was ecstatic! I thought, "This is it!" But when I got to the callback, everything felt different. The energy in the room was off, and I could sense that the casting team was not as enthusiastic as they had been during the initial audition. I tried to shake off the nerves and give it my all, but I could feel myself overthinking every line.    After the callback, I left feeling deflated. I couldn't help but wonder what had changed in such a short time. Was it me? Did I misread the room? Or was it just the nature of the business?     I know that this is part of the journey, but it’s tough to deal with the emotional rollercoaster. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? How do you cope with the highs and lows of auditioning? Any tips for staying grounded in this unpredictable industry?
__label__1 I just pulled some end-game cards and I’m beyond excited! I managed to get the new LeBron and a couple of other top-tier players. I’ve been grinding for weeks, and it finally paid off.     I’m looking to build the best lineup possible with these cards. What are some strategies you all recommend for using end-game players effectively? Should I focus on a specific playstyle or try to balance my team?     Also, if anyone has tips on how to maximize their potential in clutch time or limited modes, I’d love to hear them! Let’s get this discussion going!

__label__0 Watching the new [cinematic trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMF9EDbmQQ) was breathtaking. It was the the best cinematic from Rocket League yet!    Now I wonder with the recently announced Nvidia Omniverse Machinima, is there any chance Rocket League would be supported? Because I think it would be awesome for the public to be able to make high-quality Rocket League cinematics. Not just for gameplay montages, but also trailers (for esports events), documentaries and also revive the Rocket League machinima which exists back around launch of Rocket League (2015-2016).    It would be a really great tool for creators alike and bring Rocket League more into the spotlight!
__label__0 Looking for a good spot to have some fun and belt out some tunes.
__label__0 My family and I (2 adults, 2 children) want to live in the UK for one year. None of their visas apply to our situation (remote work for small US company). As US citizens, would we have to go back to the US to reset the tourist visa? We want to make short trips to other European countries with the UK as our home base. Because of this, we wouldn’t really ever be in the UK for a continuous 6 months. Does it matter which border we cross?
__label__0 I am looking at purchasing a Lake Lot that is just vacant land. It is in a development, multiple subdivisions, many houses already built and this is an empty lot between two houses.     The question I have, what is the best way to finance vacant land? The lot is listed at $190K. I could put down as much as 40% down, but I would rather keep that money in my TFSA and use the banks money.     Would this be a regular mortgage I talk to my bank or advisor about, or is there a better way to take out this size of loan.     Extra info, I currently have a mortgage with BMO worth around $350K and household income is just north of 200k/year. No kids or other expenses/payments.     Thanks in advance!
__label__1 I have a 5-month-old Golden Retriever who has recently started drooling excessively when left in his crate while we're out. At first, he seemed to settle down just fine, but now he gets really anxious and starts drooling a lot. I’m concerned that this might be a sign of stress or anxiety, especially since he’s still adjusting to being alone for longer periods.    I’ve tried a few things to help him feel more comfortable, like giving him a favorite toy and leaving a piece of my clothing in the crate, but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. I also make sure to take him for a good walk before crating him to tire him out, but the drooling persists.    Has anyone else experienced this with their puppy? What strategies have you found effective in reducing anxiety and drooling in the crate? I want to make sure he feels safe and secure while I’m away. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

__label__1 I recently came across the Meade 226 telescope and I'm curious to hear from anyone who has experience with it. I'm considering it as a potential addition to my collection, but I want to make sure it's a good fit for my needs.    From what I've read, the Meade 226 is a 6-inch reflector telescope, which seems like a solid size for both planetary and deep-sky observations. I appreciate that it comes with a sturdy mount and has a decent aperture for gathering light. However, I'm particularly interested in how it performs in terms of image quality and ease of use, especially for someone who is still learning the ropes of astronomy.    If anyone has used the Meade 226, could you share your thoughts on its pros and cons? How does it compare to other telescopes in a similar price range? Any tips on accessories or upgrades that could enhance the experience would also be greatly appreciated!     Thanks in advance for your insights!
__label__0 28F    I take Advair for my asthma and I’ve been taking it for 6 years. I ran out and put off going to the pharmacy to refill. Yesterday, I noticed increase in wheezing. Last night and today I’ve had really bad cold sweats. It feels like im sick but I have no other symptoms. I had COVID a little over a month ago and I’ve taken 4 tests, all negative. I work from home and rarely go out so I don’t think it’s that. Could this possibly be from stopping my Advair? I feel exhausted and I have a headache and these cold sweats. No fever at all.     I’ve filled my prescription and I will resume the med tonight.

__label__1 Running strikes with a team of Guardians who are offbuild for the singe can definitely lead to some interesting and chaotic gameplay! However, there are a few alternatives that might be even more enjoyable or rewarding:    1. **Nightfall Strikes**: If you're looking for a challenge, consider running Nightfall strikes. They not only offer a higher difficulty level but also provide better rewards, including Nightfall-specific loot and the chance to earn a higher score for the leaderboard.    2. **Raids**: Nothing beats the thrill of a well-coordinated raid. The mechanics, teamwork, and the satisfaction of overcoming a challenging encounter can be incredibly rewarding. Plus, the loot is often much better than what you get from regular strikes.    3. **Gambit**: If you want a mix of PvE and PvP, Gambit can be a great option. It allows you to engage in both aspects of the game while still working as a team to defeat the Primeval. Plus, the thrill of invading the enemy team adds an extra layer of excitement.    4. **Crucible**: For those who enjoy PvP, hopping into the Crucible can be a great way to test your skills against other players. You can experiment with different builds and weapons, and the fast-paced nature of PvP can be a refreshing change from PvE content.    5. **Seasonal Activities**: Each season brings new activities that often have unique mechanics and rewards. Engaging in these can provide a fresh experience and keep the game feeling new.    6. **Public Events and Lost Sectors**: If you're looking for a more casual experience, running public events or Lost Sectors can be a fun way to grind for loot while enjoying the game world. Plus, you can often find other Guardians to team up with.    Ultimately, it depends on what you're looking for in your gameplay experience. If you enjoy the chaos of offbuild strikes, keep doing that! But if you're looking for something different, these alternatives might just hit the spot.

__label__1 I’m having some issues with my toilet and could really use some advice from the community. It’s a standard gravity-flush toilet, and lately, it has been making a gurgling sound after flushing. Sometimes it takes a while to refill, and I’ve noticed that the water level in the bowl seems to fluctuate more than usual.     I’ve already checked the flapper and it seems to be sealing properly, and I’ve also cleaned out the tank to remove any debris. I’m wondering if this could be a sign of a clog further down the line or if it might be an issue with the fill valve.     Has anyone experienced something similar? Any tips on how to diagnose the problem or steps I can take to fix it? I’d appreciate any help!

__label__0 My husband and I are planning to move from the US to the Netherlands in November. He's an EU citizen so the process sounds much easier and his job is going to transfer over.     However, I'm getting increasingly worried about moving because I'm seeing a lot of negatives about the Netherlands- housing shortage (which I'm aware of and we will be working with a realtor to find an apartment), but also, about the coldness of society/Dutchies in general. Is this something people here have experienced? I've always wanted to live in Europe, am actively learning Dutch, and have moved around quite a lot in the states, so I'm aware it's not easy to move or make friends right away. But is living in the Netherlands as an expat truly terrible?
__label__1 I recently went through a symbolic act that I never thought would bring me so much relief. For years, I’ve been dealing with the emotional turmoil caused by my narcissistic mother. Growing up, it felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying to please her while she belittled me and made everything about her. The emotional manipulation, the guilt trips, and the constant need for validation from her were exhausting.    After years of therapy and self-reflection, I finally reached a point where I realized that I needed to let go of the hold she had on my life. I decided to do something symbolic to represent this release. I wrote a letter to her, detailing all the pain she caused me, the memories I wanted to bury, and the ways I was reclaiming my life. I poured my heart into it, expressing everything I had kept bottled up for so long.    Then, I took that letter to a quiet spot in the woods, a place where I felt safe and at peace. I dug a small hole and placed the letter inside, covering it with dirt as I said a few words about letting go of the past and the hurt she caused me. It felt cathartic to physically bury the pain and the memories that had haunted me for so long.    Afterward, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over me. It was as if I had finally severed the invisible ties that had bound me to her. I realized that I no longer needed her approval or validation to be happy. I am reclaiming my life, my happiness, and my identity.     I know this is just the beginning of a long journey, but I feel empowered and ready to move forward. I wanted to share this experience in hopes that it might inspire others who are dealing with similar situations. Sometimes, taking a symbolic step can help us find the closure we need to heal.
__label__1 I (25F) have always had a complicated relationship with my mother. Growing up, she was very critical and often made me feel like I could never do anything right. I remember feeling like I was constantly walking on eggshells around her, trying to gain her approval. As I got older, I started to distance myself emotionally because I felt like I was never good enough for her.    Now that I'm an adult, I’ve tried to have a more open relationship with her, but it’s still difficult. I’ve told her that I appreciate her and that I care about her, but I’ve never said the words "I love you." It’s not that I don’t love her; I just struggle to express it because of our past. I feel like saying it would be disingenuous given our history, and I don’t want to say something I don’t fully feel.    Recently, my mother brought this up during a family dinner. She said she feels hurt that I’ve never told her I love her and that it makes her feel like I don’t care about her. I tried to explain my feelings, but she got upset and said that I was being selfish for not wanting to make her feel loved.     Now I’m feeling guilty. I understand that she wants to hear those words, but I also feel like I’m being true to myself by not saying them if I don’t feel it in the way she wants. AITA for not telling my mother that I love her?

__label__0 Are the valkyries in the bridge entirely different from the valkyries appearing in the canon story?? Like alternate universe self? As a new player i thought the captain did not exist in the main story, yet pretty much almost everyone has some romantic thing for him- even kiana and mei...somehow, despite they being already an established yuri couple.
__label__0 Hi all, description as followed:     Age: 25  Sex: F  Ethnicity: European      Description of concern:  I have, for as long as I can remember, experienced musical hallucinations (ie when my brain sits idle, or when it's supposed to be focusing intently, I can hear very vividly audio in my ears, usually songs I know but sometimes just random jazz noodling). I didnt realize until very recently that this isnt something that everyone experiences and I'm unsure what to make of it. It has also been increasing in frequency in the past ~6 months.     I have also periodically experienced visual hallucinations since around 18 yo, such as shadows, people doing gory things, ect.. but these are usually when I'm exhausted or on high THC weed (I don't smoke anymore)     For reference, I have a family hx of schizophrenia. I know gender is in my favour but I also know my age is around the time you begin noticing symptoms. I dont have any delusions (that I know of) and am capable of working full time so I dont think I have psychosis. I know this is a long-standing problem but its concerning that its intensifying.     Is this something that I should bring up to my dr? Is there anything anyone can even do aside from me not taking drugs and getting a good night's rest? The auditory hallucinations can be annoying but they're not disturbing like the visuals are and I havent had a visual hallucination in a long time.
__label__0 If you ever think "I" am bad, terrible, worthless, a mistake, not enough, flawed, or any judgments that then make you feel terrible, this may be helpful.    When you say "I am worthless," you're saying that "you" - your "self" - is worthless. Or, "The package that is 'me' is without worth."    But there is, in reality, no you. "You" do not exist except as a concept in your mind. And if something doesn't exist and we judge that non-existent thing, our judgment is meaningless.    Confused yet? Let me explain.    Your skin exists. Your bones exist. Your blood exists. These are all things that we can objectively see and study and even add our made-up judgments to those objective things. For example, we can type your blood or name a pigment of your skin. Yes, those are made-up human constructs - but it's our way of describing a very real thing.    But there is no "self" that is you. I can't take you into a lab and find your "self." I can't take you to court and prove that a self exists in that room beyond a reasonable doubt. I may be able to prove that YOU have a belief that you have a self - but you may also have lots of beliefs that aren't rooted in reality.    Why is this important?    Because when you release your "self" concept, your overall made-up judgments disappear, too.    All of the "I am bad" or "I am worthless" or "I'm not enough" go away. You realize, in a very deep sense, that since "I" do not exist - then there's nothing to be bad, worthless, or not enough.    Now, yes... we COULD get specific if we really wanted to judge ourselves. You might be able to say, "My piano playing skills are not enough to get me onto America's Got Talent" or "My singing skills might be pretty horrific" but notice that your skills are just a sliver of who you are. They might be great or not - but those specific skills don't say anything about "you" - because your "self" simply doesn't exist.    Why is this powerful? Because I can accept that my singing skills are VERY flawed. Or, if I choose, I can work on improving them. But my singing skills, flawed as they are, can never make "me" flawed. They can never make "me" not enough. Because that judgment can only be attributed to my discernable skills of singing - and not to my brain's made-up concept of a self.    Because I sing poorly doesn't make "me" bad - because there is no me.    And all of a sudden, there are only parts of me - specific, objective parts of me - that I can either accept or choose to improve. But none of those parts make the made-up concept of "me" good or bad. "I" do not exist. My skin, bones, brain, skills, etc. exist. They have their own unique states at any given moment. But none of them make me "less than" - unless I continue to hold onto a made-up belief that "I" exist and "I" can be judged good or bad based on slivers of who I am.    The death of the self is simply a letting go of the concept of the "self." A realization that the "self" is simply a made-up construct of the mind - that we often give universal, generalized labels to. And, in many cases, these subjective labels we give to this made-up concept make us feel very real and very painful emotions.    We are causing ourselves pain - because of a misunderstanding.    The misunderstanding that "I" exist.    There is no "I." There is no "self." There are just all of the physical pieces, the brain and its hormones and neurotransmitters, specific skills... all slivers we can accept or change.    So let go of this overall "self" and see how you feel.    Let go of the overall "self-judgments" and see how you feel.    Without a self, all of your painful self-judgments have nothing to cling to.    And in that self-less state is a great deal of peace.
__label__1 Building excellent relations with a fanatic xenophobe in Stellaris can be quite the challenge, but it’s not impossible! Here are some strategies that might help you navigate this tricky diplomatic landscape:    1. **Shared Borders and Non-Aggression Pacts**: If you share a border with the fanatic xenophobe, establishing a non-aggression pact can be a good first step. This shows that you are not a threat and can help ease tensions.    2. **Trade Agreements**: Offering trade deals can improve relations significantly. Even if they are fanatic xenophobes, they may appreciate the economic benefits of trade, especially if you can offer resources they need.    3. **Defensive Pacts**: If you can convince them that you share a common enemy, forming a defensive pact can help build trust. This is particularly effective if there’s a nearby aggressive empire that poses a threat to both of you.    4. **Cultural Exchange**: While fanatic xenophobes may not be open to cultural exchange in the traditional sense, you can still try to engage them through shared interests or mutual goals. If you can find a way to align your interests, it may help.    5. **Avoiding Conflict**: This might seem obvious, but avoiding any form of conflict or aggression towards them is crucial. Even minor skirmishes can set back relations significantly.    6. **Influence and Diplomacy**: Use your influence to improve relations. You can send envoys to improve relations, and if you have the resources, consider using diplomatic options that might sway them positively.    7. **Respect Their Borders**: Make sure to respect their territory and avoid any actions that could be seen as encroaching on their space. This includes not sending science ships or construction ships into their territory without permission.    8. **Be Patient**: Building relations with a fanatic xenophobe will take time. Be patient and keep working on improving relations gradually.     9. **Utilize Espionage**: If you have the appropriate DLC, consider using espionage to gather information about their empire. This can help you understand their motivations and possibly exploit weaknesses in their diplomatic stance.    10. **Roleplay**: If you enjoy roleplaying, consider creating a narrative where your empire is genuinely trying to understand and respect their values, even if they are xenophobic. This can make the game more enjoyable and immersive.    Remember, fanatic xenophobes are inherently distrustful of other species, so it may take a lot of effort to build a strong relationship. However, with persistence and the right strategies, you can create a surprisingly positive diplomatic environment!
