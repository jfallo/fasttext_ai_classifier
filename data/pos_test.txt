VB JJ NNP NNP NNP NN : RB of VBG a NN , you can VB a NN NN . A NN VBZ JJ NNS to VB to the same NN and NN with each other IN VBG to VB and VB the NNS . It VBD s VBN to VB JJ NNS at once , VBG it a JJR NN for VBG JJ NNS . In JJ , an NNP NN can VB t be VBN IN JJ at the other NN because it doesn JJ t VBP for JJ NN between NNS . It VBD s IN VBG to have a NN with CD NNS on the same NN NN : you VBP a NN to VB them RB for it to VB .
__label__1 I VBP on the NN for a NN of NN NNS under $ CD that can VB JJ JJ NN for both NN and JJ NN . I RB VBP to a NN of NNS , VBG NN , JJ , and some JJ , so I VBP NN NN . NN is RB a JJ NN for me , as I RB VBP NNS for VBN NNS . I VBP m JJ to both VBN and NN NNS , but if I VBP for NN , I VBP d VBP NN with JJ NN NN and JJ NN for VBG . I VBP VBN JJ NNS about NNS IN NNP , NNP , and NNP , but I VBP not JJ which JJ NNS to VB . Any NNS or JJ NNS MD be RB JJ .
__label__1 I VBP been VBG about a NN that some of PRP MD VB with JJ NNP NNP . If a NN VBZ the NNP NNP NN , can you RB VB it if you VBP your NN from the NN . I VBP that some NNS VBP you to VB RP if you VBP VBN them while they were RB JJ on NNP NNP , but I VBP JJ if VBG from the NN MD VB you to VB the NN NN . Has NN VBD this . Does it VB for all NNS , or are there JJ NNS that MD not VB NN NN after VBG NNP NNP . Any NNS MD be VBN .
__label__0 My NN has been VBG a NN ( NNP ) for about CD NNS . RB after they VBD RB , my NN VBD JJ ( CD ) with my now JJ NN NNP . RB , he has been JJ . NNP is on NNS , and he VBZ , and my NN VBZ this . He is RB JJ to her , but no NN what we VBP her , she will not VB . NNP has VBN about VBG me JJ ( I am a NN ) RB . NNP has RB VBN my JJ NN ( NNP ) NN , and UH , my NN was their . NNP has VBN at her and VBD her to VB herself when she VBD to VB him out . My NN ( NNP ) has VBN out NNP out JJ NNS , but NNP RB VBD him VB RB . NNP VBZ to VB his CD NN JJ NN and NNS NNP JJ NNS . NNP RB VBD and VBD a VBG NN against him , but of NN , she VBD it after he VBD into an NN NN , but then he VBD RB RB . It VBD so JJ I VBD my NN for PDT a NN , but then , of NN , I had to VB RB . I am so JJ in my own NN RB that I just RB VBP in my NN . I just RB VB to VB this off my NN . ( JJ if this is JJ this is my JJ NN )
__label__0 Is a NNP CD CD and NNP JJ NNP NN . I VBP VBN on the NNP NN that they are but I VBP RB VBN on NNS its too JJ for the NN and in JJ NNS be too JJ . NNS

__label__1 I VBP been VBG with JJ VBG NNS RB and I VBD IN the NN of VBG a VBG NN to VB VB the NN of NN on my NN . I VBD to NN how I VBD CD and VB if NN RB has NNS or NNS . To VB my VBG NN , I VBD a few JJ NNS : CD . VB IN A JJ NN of NN NNP NNP : I VBD a NN from a NN NN , about CD NNS by CD NNS . This will VB NN IN VBG the NN . CD .

VB the NN in the NN and VB a JJ NN of NN . You VBP it to be JJ , not VBG NN . CD . When you VBP JJ to VB NN , RB VB your NN on the JJ NN before VBG it to your NNS . This VBZ to VB the NN of NN on the NN and NNS it from being too NN , which can VB to JJ NN . CD . After a few NNS , you can VB the NN if VBN , but be JJ not to VB it .

__label__0 So CD NNS IN I had NN VBN and my NN NNS were CD NN and I just have VBN VBN the other NN and that NN has now VBN to CD NNS . should I be VBN about this or is it JJ .
__label__1 NNP NN , I VBP you VBP re all doing RB . I VBP m VBG out because I RB VBD my NN NN , and it NNP s RB JJ NNP . I VBP in a JJ NN , and I can VB t RB JJ my NN IN how it MD be so JJ . I VBP ve been VBG to VB out if this is a JJ NN or if there NNP s NN JJ I MD be doing JJ . I RB VBP the NN VBN to a JJ NN , and I VBP to be JJ of VBG it down when I VBP m not NN .

__label__1 If you had to VB between VBG CD NNS who are very JJ in NN , but have JJ NNS or NNS , who MD you VB .

__label__0 So this is VBG RB be a JJ NN so VBZ in NN . I VBP only RB had NNP JJ NN on $ CD . I have RB no NN in NNS of any NN . After VBG and RB VBG NNP NNP NNP NN NN and the NN in the NNP , I VBP IN NNP NN MD be VBN . The only NN I do RB RB VB for is the NN of NN NN IN that VBZ RB JJ how NNP is VBN to be VBN the most JJ NN in the NN VBZ from JJ NNS on the NN . I RB VBP VBG RB has a few NNS and VBZ IN it MD be VBN . Is there NN JJ NN of JJ NN or is that it . Is JJ JJ NN IN the NN at all for IN CD JJ NNS . Not RB , but I VBP that if you VBP NNP JJ NN , ( which is RB JJR where I VBP from ) there is an JJ that VBZ those CD NNS . Is this JJ .

__label__1 I VBP VBG for a NN of `` NNP CC NNP : An NN to NNP NNP , CD NN '' by NNP . The NNP is CD . If NN has a JJ or JJ NN they MD NN or NN , I MD RB VB it . NNP you .
__label__0 NN : My NN just VBD a NN JJ a few NNS RB . He VBZ s a NN NN NN ( we are VBG on JJ NN NNS to VB ) . IN we VBD him NN at CD he VBD s been an JJ NN that VBZ his NN .

__label__0 I VBP TO VB some NNP Who NNP and I VBD to the NNP in a NNP NN . But RB all of them VBP VBN out . Are they RB VBD TO be VBN . Or does VBN Out JJ NN . CC NN : # NN : RB , the NN NN , VBZ NN . NNS with that . It VBD out NNS RB .
__label__1 So , I was at the NN the other NN , and I VBD this JJ NN on a NN , VBG out at the NN IN it was VBG NN . I MD RB VB but VB , `` This NN is VBG NN to his NN NN .

__label__0 NN VBD NNS
__label__0 All i VBP is it VBD a NN IN FW JJS and there was a NN VBG a JJ VBN NNP NN JJ NNS and DT now and then there should be a NN VBG NN that VBZ IN '' NNP on me '' NN NN .
__label__0 NN VBD NNS
__label__0 It VBZ s so VBG the NN NN does VBG and NNS . It VBZ s all VBN on NNS and it VBZ me NN . Why are you VBG CD NNS to the NN that VBZ out RB a NN . . I VBP this NN so JJ and can VB t NN to VB .
__label__0 NN VBD NNS
__label__1 NNP NN , I VBP been on JJ NN ( CD RB ) for about CD NNS now , and while I VBP VBN some NN in my NN NN , I VBP RB not VBG the NN I was VBG for . I VBP been VBG about JJ NN and how it can RB VB NNS , RB for those of PRP who are RB VBG VBG . I VBP VBG VBG a JJ NN NN to my JJ , but I VBP JJ if it VBZ a JJ NN to VB it with the JJ NN . Has NN here had NN with VBG both RB . Did you VBP any JJ NNS . RB , are there any JJ NN NNS I should be JJ of when VBG both . I have RB VBN any JJ NN NNS from the JJ NN , but I VBP to be JJ about VBG NN JJ to my NNS . NNS in NN for your NNS .
__label__0 I VBP this does RB VB VBN down , I VBP JJ here and I do RB RB VB where to VB this . I was JJ RB to VB a JJ JJ NN , which RB VBD me VB to VB with what I VBD to be , and I VBD to be an NN . NNP RB a NN , I VBD JJ NN with JJ NNS to VB me into a JJ JJ NN for NN in NNP . But IN VBG JJ NN I VBP VBN very JJ NN from my NNS in NNS of VBG me up for JJ IN they are NNS of CD . The NN NN NN of the NNP has VBN me very JJ to VB with . So VBG with NN , and VBG on JJ VBZ NN just JJ . I do RB VB an NN or NNS from my NNS , they RB VBD me with a NN POS NN ( RB do RB have CD ) . So I VBD up JJ NNS and VBD a very NN JJ NN at the NN of me being JJ to VB the NNS , NNS and VBG in JJ so VBN out on a NN . Just to VB NN to the NN NNP is VBG , I do RB have a NN and NN I do now is in IN a NN . So I was VBG a NN with NN . NNS VBD I VBP RB and JJ with my NNS , but I VBD my NN just before JJ VBD the NN . And I VBP VBN JJ NN with my NN , she VBD it RB an NN and not a JJ NN to be RB . So I VBP at my JJ NN . I VBD I RB RB VBP VBG on NNS than VBP with NN that VBZ VBN a NN of NN in my NN . NNP RB again . I VBP RB RB JJ at what I do , I VBP to NN and NN . So I VBD up VBG with a JJ NN of JJ NN . RB RB VBG , and have NNS to my NN . So VBG RP a few NNS , I VBD JJ NN doing NNP for a JJ NN . This was during the JJ NN of my NN so NN was VBG up . I VBP VBN NNS of NNS and VBD the JJ NN that VBD into my NNS . It VBZ not what I VBP to do , but I VBD the NN more than NN . My NN is JJ , I VBP CD NNS a NN , and I have to VB CD NNS in JJ which VBZ NN . And this is where my NNS JJ NNS . At my NN , I was JJ I VBD my NN . I had my CD NNS of NN as my NN VB VBN out in NN of my NNS and NN . I was JJ and VBD about what VBZ RB of me . My NN is JJ , I VBP CD , he VBZ CD . With my NNS , I VBP JJ to my NN . During my NN , he VBD me he had NN NN NN and the NNS have RB VBN out what NN he was on . So my NN has been VBN for the NN of the NN . NNP I RB had to VB up the NN to VB to VB with my NNS we had a JJ NN I had a JJ NN , but the JJ NN I had the NN of my NN VBG me he has NN on my NN . I VBP there is no JJ NN to VB NN you VBP VBN NN . But the JJ NN in NNS I have that NN was JJ . From being VBN and NN of my NN to my NN VBG me he has NN . My NN VBD before me , my NN is VBG it and VBG VB all just RB after my NN . It was a NN but I had to VB it RB , if not for the NNS IN me but for myself in VBG to VB what was VBN to be my NN . I VBP at my NNS IN me and I VBP that they have NNS that VBP them in all NNS , and I MD RB VB but VB JJ and JJ that I did RB VB NNS of the NNS they VBD from their NNS . I VBD most of my NN POS NNS so I VBP VBP what they are JJ . So NNS IN a NN NN , or a NN I can VB to where my NNS are RB VBG at each other is JJ to me . My NN is RB JJ , my NNS own CD NNS in NNP , but the NN that I had to VB for NN RB just to VB some NN on my NN and when I VBP for them to VB me VB my NN POS NN they VBD me down . That VBZ when I VBD VBG NN of my NNS , and I VBP this is RB JJ . I VBD VBG this and VBD that they VBD me to VBG NN for CD NNS , so I can VB RB from my NN , and so they do RB have to VB with me . My NNS VBP with their JJ NN , I VBP this VBD with my NN , she is an JJ , and JJ I VBP when you VBP VBG with that it VBZ RB JJ . So I VBP had a NN of NN VBG up . RB , my VBG NN VBD what was VBG on and VBD me the JJS they can . For how JJ up of an JJ I VBP I VBD out JJ My NNS were RB my NN NNS . My NN NNS were the NNS that VBD me NN and VBD me a NN to VB on . And now they VBD off to NNP NNP , after VBG me how JJ NN is they VBD a NN to NNP and NN to VB there RB JJ NN . While my NN has NN . I MD RB VB but VB them a NN . I VBP IN after I VBD with NN they VBD me into the NN of NN . And I VBP IN I VBP VBG . They VBP VBN me so JJ NN and JJ to VB me with VBG me up in NN . I VBD myself through NN because I VBD a JJR NN but I VBP IN the JJR NN is RB VBG . RB , I VBP been VBN on VBG my NN POS NN and VBG up for a NN . I VBP IN I can VB a NN of NN with a NN . I can VB for NNS further RB , I can VB and VB more . But I MD RB because of a JJ NN of NNS VBG to VB I MD RB RB VB my NN RB CD NN RB VBG to VB for it myself or RB VB up for a NN . With JJ NN NN on NN of it . All of this is VBG an JJ NN on me . And I VBP I VBP to VB NN about it . but I VBP VBG the NN or NN to VB that . I VBP so JJ I VBD my NN and the NNS I VBP VBN now .

__label__1 In a NN where NNS VBP not just NNS but NNS , NNS , and NNS , it VBZ JJ to VB about which NN we MD be JJ to VB for . For me , the NN that VBZ out is the JJ NN .

__label__1 A while RB , I VBD a NN VBG my NNS with NNP NNS and the NNS I VBD IN the NN . IN then , I VBP had NN to VB on my NN as an JJ and how my NNS have VBN .

RB , as I VBD myself from the NN , I VBD to VB NNS from a JJR NN . I VBD that JJ of these NNS were RB VBN in a NN that VBD their NN and NNS .

I VBP VBN to VB that the NNS I VBD were not RB about JJ NNS but RB about a NN that VBZ these JJ NNS . This NN has VBN me to VB my JJ with a NN more NN , RB if I RB VBP NN to my NNS about the NN for NN . Now , as I VBP NN IN of NNP , I VBP myself VBG for JJR NNS and JJ NN between NNS . I VBP that by VBG our NNS and NNS , we can VB VB the JJ NNS that have been VBN in PRP . I VBP m JJ to VB from NNS who have had JJ NNS . How have your NNS on NN NNS VBD IN VBG NNP .

__label__1 I have a JJ NNP who has RB VBN a NN JJ with her NN . She VBD to VB her NNS , but now she RB VBZ at her NN and VB RB .

__label__0 So if you did , you will be VBN a JJ JJ NN NN on the NNP NN and your JJ NN won NNP t NN in the NN ( from what I VBD ) , a NN RB . This NNP NN with this is , you can not NN JJ NN until the JJ NN VBZ . To VB IN this NN , VB your JJ NN to your NNP NNP . RB , VB your JJ NN NN to your NNP NNP if you haven JJ t RB VBN so . VB NNS to your NNP NNP NN ( RB in your NNP NNP ) from your NNP NNP NN . Then VB NNS from your NNP NNP NN to your JJ NN NN RB . It VBZ s a NN , but you have NN NN .

__label__1 NNP is a NN . I VBD it . You VBP it VBZ s all NN and NNS , VBG NN on NN IN it NNP s some NN of JJ NN . NNP , NN . NNP is out here VBG NNS against NN , CD NN NN at a NN . You VBP that NN NN is JJ . NNP , it VBZ s a NN for the JJ NN VBD in its NN . DT NN you VBP a NN up , a JJ NN of your NN NNS . You VBP you VBP re VBG . NNP , you VBP re just a NN in NNP NNP s VBD NN .

__label__1 So , I was VBG The NNP CD JJ NN and I had the most JJ NN with a NN in my NN . I had my NNP VBG a JJ NN when RB , the NN VBD NN . I VBD and VBD to have my NNP VB the NNS , but RB , they just VBD there VBG . I RB VBD to DT NNP in the NN to VB the NN NN , but by the NN they VBD , the NN was RB VBN in NNS .
