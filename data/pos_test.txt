__label__1 NNP is CD of the most JJ and JJ NNS in the NN of NNP and the NN NNP NNP NN . For those who MD not be JJ , NNP is a JJ JJ VBN from the NN NN NN , and it has a NN for being RB JJ and JJ . In NNP , NNP is RB VBN with the NNP , who are VBN for their NN for NN NN and its NNS . The NN is VBN in most NNS , VBG NNP , and is RB VBN to the JJ NN . You can VB NNP being VBN in JJ NNS of NNS , RB in NNS IN the NNP in the NNP in NNP , where you can VB some RB JJ NNS . The NNS of NNP are RB JJ , VBG a NN of NN and VBN NNS , but it VBZ at a NN . NNS can VB JJ , VBG to VB NN NNS and a NN in NN . This is VBN in the NN through JJ NNS and NNS with NNP who have VBN NN to its NN . What I VBP VBG is how JJ VBZ as a JJ NN in NNP . It VBZ NNS about NN , the NNS of NN NN , and the JJ NNS of NN NN in NN . The NN does RB VB RP from VBG the NN NN of NNP , with NNS that VBP VBG those VBN by it or VBG with the JJ NNS that VBP from its NN . So , what VBZ the NN with NNP .

__label__0 So , I was a JJ NN NN of NNP ( CD NNS ) and VBD VBG JJ NNS ( NN . NNS , NN NNS that MD be VBN , JJ that MD RB VB RP when RB did RB have an NN with this ) . I did some NN NN , because I VBP a NN of other NNS and VBD that the NN was the most JJ NN , IN I was VBG it JJR than its JJ NN . I VBD these NNS up to my NN ( he VBZ JJ to me , IN my JJ NN VBD ) , and he VBZ `` not JJ , IN you VBP on all these other NNS that VBP all of this NN too . '' I VBP , VBP POS NN to NNP RB , because my other NNS VBD with my JJ NN when I VBD it up to him , and I was having NNS VBG my NNP on NN RB from my NN , and I do RB VB to have to VB about my NN NN . He VBZ , IN We do it . I now have NNP NNP . So , VB what VBZ RB . The JJ NN NNS , the NNS : I VBP RB VBN a few NNS in the JJ CD NNS IN I VBP had it ( not a NN to be VBN about ) . BUT , I VBP a NN more JJ than JJ , and my NNP VBD that my NNS should be VBG RB RB , but they have RB RB . I do VB him in DT CD NNS or so . I do VB JJ `` NN NNS '' that they should be VBG , but : NN . I VBP VBG if they will VB RB at all , or if my NN will VB while I VBP on NNP , just IN it did with the NNP . My NN was RB too JJ on that , and DT was my NN . If NN has any NN with a NN from NNP to a JJ NNP , I MD VB to VB from you . RB , I VBP not RB JJ which NNP to PRP , so I VBD the CD I did because it VBD JJ , if it should be VBN , VB VB me VB which CD I should VB and I MD VB it .
__label__1 I was at a NN the other NN , and I VBP a NN of NNS VBG about their NNS with JJ NNS . CD of them VBD , `` Once you VBP RB , you are RB JJ to VB RB .

NNS MD be VBG to VB their NNS by VBG off their JJ NNS , but RB , they VBP d VBP up VBG their NN NNS over or RB VBG their NN POS NN . And what if it VBD to other NNS too . IN , once you VBP ve VBN the JJ NN of NN , you can RB VB RB to VB NN again . Or once you VBP ve VBN a NN in NNP , DT other NN just NNS IN a JJ NN . So , I VBP the NN of the NN is : be JJ what you VBP into , because once you VBP NNP , or NN , or NNP , there NNP s no VBG RB .

__label__1 So , I was VBG a RB JJ NNP NN JJ NN , and I VBD RB into it . I was VBG NNS and RB VBN in the NN . At CD NN , I VBD so into it that I RB VBD over a NN I had RB .

What did you do . VB in NN for any NN .
__label__0 So I VBP m just NN of NN of NN RB and it NNP s VBG NN and NN to VB DT JJ NN I VBD to VB VBG or VB to VB from doing NN I RB shouldn JJ t because it MD VB the NNS IN . I VBP ve NN RB my JJ NN being VBN and VBN in NNS from RB RB JJ NN I VBD . NN that didn NNP t RB me VBD up VBG me because of my JJ NN NNS CD of which being my NN so NN NN I was VBG . RB the NNS VBD me IN NN because of my NN and JJ I was JJ to VB and was RB JJ . To JJ to have NNS VBP you IN VB some be VBN NN of an NN . Then I VBD CD NN in my NN she was CD of the JJS NN I have RB VBN to NN and she was the only NN I MD be CD NN myself with . I VBD up at IN CD VBG to VB my JJ NN with as a NN . Then she and I both VBD up VBG to JJ NNS to which a NN RB she VBD up VBG because she was VBN from the NN down and her NN just couldn JJ t VB it RB . I VBD up VBG out of NN after that because DT NN had no NN over the NN . Then from there I VBD up VBG a NN who I VBP out with for a NN then I was CD by this NN and I had IN JJ NNS so we VBD a JJR NNS to VB in some NN . The only NNS was JJ and NN to VB but more to me so he VBD JJ and VBD RB NN VBG her NN NN VBD me to VB over to his to which he VBD up RB VBG me wouldn NNP t NN VBG me so I had to VB under his NN until his NN VBZ up in the NN to which I VBD and RB VBD out with him again . Then he VB up VBG up at my JJ VBG I VBP NN from him and he was VBG to VB me out NN if I didn JJ t NN it . So I did then he VBD a few NN RB at a NN he had CD NNS VB me down and VB me but some VBP some NNS VBG but VBD that up . Then a few NNS RB I VBD up VBG a NN I VBD up VBG for but RB being JJ he VBD me as RB and I VBD my JJS to VB it if I MD because I VBD the NN so I VBP . Other then that he was JJ and he RB VBD my NN NN a few NNS where he VBD to VB me but I didn JJ t NN in . From there not JJ VBD until I was CD when I VBD my JJ JJ NN NN to which my NN VBD her NN and we had to VB RB to the NN I VBD from NNS there for about CD to CD NNS . To which my NN VBD up VBG me JJ between VBG with her to NNP . Now I VBD I MD have VBN with my NN and VBD VBG CD of my NN NNS who I have VBN my JJ NN but she wasn NNP t the JJS when we were NNS . So about CD to CD NNS RB I VBD up to VB the NN on her JJ NNS VBP which RB VBZ me to this very NN I RB VB her some NNS when I VBP my NNS . To which we had To VB RB to where we VBD . To which I had to VB at the NN where I VBD because her NN wouldn NNP t VB me VB with them . So I VBD CD NNS VBG RB NN to NN until my NN VBD RB to which I VBD my JJ NN about CD NNS after that and VBD a JJ CD NNS in a very JJ NN the JJ NN was the JJS I RB VBP from that NN NN . She VBD on me JJ NNS , then my NN IN NN and she VBD VBG me IN VB RB that NN and VBD up having my NN VB NN me because she wouldn JJ t . Then CD of the JJ NNS she VBD up me was VBG to which she VBD to VB me until after we had NN The NN of that CD VBD me IN . Which NN to some RB JJ NN where RB NNP where she VB the JJ NN VBG me and did NN with CD NNS but VBD she didn NNP t have NN with but then VBD to have NN with a JJ NN to which I VBD up VBG up with her but not VBG my NN because I VBD to be her NN and with NNS out with her to which RB NNP NNP s NNS she VBD NN to VB and VB for an JJ NN or what VBD JJ CD to which she VBD me to VB me she VBD so some NNS NN VBD with him and that she was VBG him now which VBD with me RB RBR . So with a NN of NNS JJ in my NN I VBD on as RBS as I MD to VB an JJ NNS I have VBN the JJ CD NN with . CC this JJ NN which was a down NN NN . RB the NN from the JJ NN has VBN to JJ NN and I don JJ t VBP if I can RB VB from but I did my JJS with this JJ CD . But RB she VBD CD NNS before my NN that she didn JJ t VBP to be RB and I VBP ve been VBG with that NN and NN it is now CD NNS until my NN . Then to VB NNS JJR I just VBD my NN NN s NN was CD NNS after NN . So I just don JJ t RB VBP what to do RB or how to VB VBG RB . The NN for VBG NN is a NN in the NN . I VBP ve NN so JJ at VBG my NNS that I NN them with no NN I VBP ve JJ my NN so RB NNS don JJ t VBP I have it RB and IN it my JJ doesn NNP t VBP I can VB NN with just VBN so that NNP s VBG me and I VBP m VBG to VB down my JJ JJ NN which is VBG for DT . Just so I can VB the NN and NN were RB but is was from more then CD NNS RB so I have to VB . I VBP m just not JJ how RB more I can VB at this NN and it is RB VBG JJ to just not VB up and RB RB Because VBG with CD NNS of NN is JJ RB and VBG is RB RBR . So JJ you to NN that RB VBZ to VB all this and I RB VBP that NNP s I VBP m just NN to VBG IN I VBP m not VBN RB so JJ you .

The NNP have had their NNS in the NN , RB during the NNP NN , but they do RB VB the same JJ NN against the NNPS as the NNPS do . RB , while the NNP NN is VBG and has its own JJ NNS , a NNP NN MD RB VB more NNS JJ to the JJ NN and NN . What do you all VB . Is the JJ NN NN to VB the JJ NNS NNS .

__label__0 This isn VBZ t the JJ NN they RB VBP about . Does NN VB what this NN did or what it was for .
__label__1 I VBP VBG for some NN with NNP on NNP . I VBP been VBG to VB JJ him and MD RB VB a JJ NN to VB this NN a NN JJR . If NN is JJ to VB me , I MD be at the NN NN IN the NN to the NN NN . NN : JJ NNS in NN .
__label__1 In a NN where NN VBZ themselves JJ in JJ , it VBZ that VBG your NN MD be more RB JJ than VBG your NNS . This is because , in JJ NNS , the NN is VBN with NN and JJ NN , while NNS are RB VBN as JJ and JJ . VBG your NN MD VB to a more JJ NN from NNS , as they MD VB you as a NN in NN RB than just a JJ NN . It VBZ JJ how our JJ NNS VBP what we VBP in NNS of NN and NN .
__label__0 NN NN , NN VBP where i can VB a NN NN NN NN . NN : NN . NN CC NN : CC CC NN : CC CC NN : NN
__label__0 I VBD a NN NN from NNP NNP after they VBD my NN from DT NN . It just so JJ , I was VBG into VBG out an JJ NN to VB my NN . So , while on the NN with them , they VBD to VB me IN $ CD to VB off my JJ NNP and have VBN to VB my NN . In NN , they VBD to RB VB my NN , which will be VBN off in CD NNS , and VB DT CD NN NN with a $ CD NN in JJ NNS . So RB they VBD to VB me a $ CD NN in NN for RB $ CD over CD NNS . RB I VBP d just VB it off , but I was so JJ with this NN , and I VBP some NNS will VB for this , I just VBD to NN .
__label__1 I VBP RB JJ in VBG NNS where NNP has a NN or NNS . It MD be a JJR or JJR NN or NN , or RB JJ NNS . I VBP it MD be VBG to VB how having NNS MD VB NNP POS NN NN and his NNS with NNS , RB with NNP and the NN of NNP JJ . If NN has NNS for NNS that VBP into this JJ , I MD VB to VB them out . IN it VBZ a JJ NN on NN NNS or NN more JJ , I VBP JJ to all NNS of NNS . NNS in NN .
__label__0 So I was doing a NN and I VBD this NN NN is in NN . RB NN I have can VB RB RB to it . I have VBN JJ NN , NN POS , and both NNS but no NN or NNS , so as RB as I can VB there VBZ no NN to VB IN the NN . I VBP VBN VBG here but the JJ NNS too RB RB , there VBZ no NN to VB him to VB up there . You can VB there from NN POS NNS but DT NN in NNP is out of NN , so there VBZ no NN the JJ NNS I can VB there . The NN NN in the NN above is NNP out of NN , so it does RB VB I can VB up there . So for some NN the NN VBZ I can VB this NN . NNP NN I VBD NN to VB IN the NN just to VB it off , so NNS MD VB . I did NOT VB it up here RB . VB The NN NN and JJ NNP ( NN : NN .

I VBP so JJ , is there some JJ NN I VBP RB VBN . JJ JJ NN : if the NN is RB VBN I VBP . This is my JJ RB VBZ NN and I VBD NNS while I was VBG it , but they all VBD when I VBD it so I had to VB them RB .
__label__0 CD NNS of NN ( CD as NN and CD as VBN ) . NN it VBZ about CD NN that I am VBN . Our NN was RB JJ and JJ , I VBD that our JJ NNS was only VBG to VB JJ NNS that VBD just before . So it was JJ JJ NNS , NN JJ NNS ( JJ NN , NNS with me or my NN ) then we RB did NN RB , IN a NN . The JJ few NNS VBD to VB RB JJ to me , but it was JJ for me is that she did RB VBD JJ NN RB when I VBD RB about what was VBG on . It was IN she did RB VB me and VBD me only for the NNS I did for her . We RB VBD NNS NN , and when we were VBG to the NN , she VBD that I only did the NNS that I VBD . NNP , I RB did NN for that NN , VBD CD NNS for PRP , JJ NNS , NNS , NNS , I VBP CD or CD NNS than her , and she VBD RB all my NN NN NNS , NN and NNS . It was RB JJ to VB that . And the NN was that when I VBD for the NN NN , it was not VBN for me , IN NN , NN , NN . She only VBD to VB NN for me , MD be NN or NNS . I VBD NN IN I was being VBN for her own NNS . RB I was RB VBN and VBN to , about some NNS . It VBD to a NN that the NN VBD me on my JJ NN to VB a NN , because I did RB VB to VB IN this , so I VBP to VB .

__label__0 This will be my JJ JJ NN IN I have VBN a NN of VBG with NNS and NN , just VBG to VB a NN NN that VBZ RB JJ . Now before you VBP VBG me to VB a CD or NN JJ NN , I RB VBP JJ NN as I VBP VBG to VB into JJ NN VBG IN NNP NNP , NNP , FW , and I VBP this MD be a JJ NN to VB into that NN .
__label__1 VBG in the NNP NNPS can VB RB JJ VBG on where you are , and that NNP s RB because each NN VBZ to VB its own NNS about how NNS VBP .

On the other NN , some NNS have NN NNS . They MD VB you to VB a JJ NN of NNP , NN when you can VB , or VB it JJR to VB . This can VB IN a NN with a NN of NNS and NNS , where you have to VB through NNS to VB in . The NNS for these NNS can VB . Some NNS VBP that NN NNS VBP VB NN or NN , while NNS VBP that VBG VBG JJR NNS more NNS to VB .

NNP NNS at NNP and VBZ him `` FW NN '' not because of his NNS in NNP , but because NNP had just VBN NNP POS NN . He VBZ `` is it a NN of NN you VBP VBG for .
